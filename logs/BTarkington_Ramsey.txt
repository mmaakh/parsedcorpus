Parsing [sent. 1 len. 40]: RAMSEY MILHOLLAND by Booth Tarkington To the Memory of Billy Miller -LRB- William Henry Harrison Miller II -RRB- 1908 - 1918 Little Patriot , Good Citizen Friend of Mankind Chapter I When Johnnie comes marching home again , Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 2]: Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 11]: We 'll give him a hearty welcome then , Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 2]: Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 33]: The men with the cheers , the boys with shouts , The ladies they will all turn out , And we 'll all feel gay , when Johnnie comes marching home again !
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 77]: The old man and the little boy , his grandson , sat together in the shade of the big walnut tree in the front yard , watching the `` Decoration Day Parade , '' as it passed up the long street ; and when the last of the veterans was out of sight the grandfather murmured the words of the tune that came drifting back from the now distant band at the head of the procession .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 24]: `` Yes , we 'll all feel gay when Johnnie comes marching home again , '' he finished , with a musing chuckle .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 7]: `` Did you , Grandpa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 4]: the boy asked .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 6]: `` Did I what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 13]: `` Did you all feel gay when the army got home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 17]: `` It did n't get home all at once , precisely , '' the grandfather explained .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 18]: `` When the war was over I suppose we felt relieved , more than anything else . ''
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 20]: `` You did n't feel so gay when the war _ was _ , though , I guess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 4]: the boy ventured .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 8]: `` I guess we did n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 7]: `` Were you scared , Grandpa ?
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 10]: Were you ever scared the Rebels would win ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 9]: We were n't ever afraid of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 7]: `` Not any at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 6]: Not any at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 12]: `` Well , were n't you ever scared yourself , Grandpa ?
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 10]: I mean when you were in a battle . ''
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 12]: `` Oh , yes ; _ then _ I was . ''
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 5]: The old man laughed .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 5]: `` Scared plenty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 13]: `` I do n't see why , '' the boy said promptly .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 11]: `` I would n't be scared in a battle . ''
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 7]: `` Would n't you ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 4]: ` Course not !
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 13]: Grandpa , why do n't you march in the Decoration Day Parade ?
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 7]: Would n't they let you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 10]: `` I 'm not able to march any more .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 15]: Too short of breath and too shaky in the legs and too blind . ''
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 11]: `` I would n't care , '' said the boy .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 14]: `` I 'd be in the parade anyway , if I was you .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 22]: They had some sittin ' in carriages , ` way at the tail end ; but I would n't like that .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 29]: If I 'd been in your place , Grandpa , and they 'd let me be in that parade , I 'd been right up by the band .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 4]: Look , Grandpa !
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 5]: Watch me , Grandpa !
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 11]: This is the way I 'd be , Grandpa . ''
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 75]: He rose from the garden bench where they sat , and gave a complex imitation of what had most appealed to him as the grandeurs of the procession , his prancing legs simulating those of the horse of the grand marshal , while his upper parts rendered the drums and bugles of the band , as well as the officers and privates of the militia company which had been a feature of the parade .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 12]: The only thing he left out was the detachment of veterans .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 3]: `` Putty-boom !
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 2]: Putty-boom !
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 3]: Putty-boom-boom-boom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 23]: he vociferated , as the drums -- and then as the bugles : `` Ta , ta , ra , tara ! ''
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 16]: He addressed his restive legs : '' _ Whoa _ , there , you Whitey !
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 2]: Gee !
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 2]: Haw !
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 4]: Git up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 11]: Then , waving an imaginary sword : `` Col-lumn right !
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 4]: Farwud _ March !
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 3]: _ Halt !
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 4]: Carry _ harms !
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 8]: _ '' He `` carried arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 5]: `` Show-dler _ harms !
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 14]: _ '' He `` shouldered arms , '' and returned to his seat .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 8]: `` That 'd be me , Grandpa .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 9]: That 's the way I 'd do . ''
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 47]: And as the grandfather nodded , seeming to agree , a thought recently dismissed returned to the mind of the composite procession and he asked : `` Well , _ why _ were n't you ever afraid the Rebels would whip the Unions , Grandpa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 10]: `` Oh , we knew they could n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 6]: `` I guess so . ''
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 12]: The little boy laughed disdainfully , thinking his question satisfactorily answered .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 12]: `` I guess those ole Rebels could n't whipped a flea !
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 17]: They did n't know how to fight any at all , did they , Grandpa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes , they did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 5]: The boy was astounded .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 15]: `` Were n't they all just reg ` lar ole cowards , Grandpa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 8]: `` No , '' said the grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 8]: `` They were pretty fine soldiers . ''
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 4]: `` They were ?
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 18]: Well , they ran away whenever you began shootin ' at 'em , did n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 12]: `` Sometimes they did , but most times they did n't .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 17]: Sometimes they fought like wildcats -- and sometimes we were the ones that ran away . ''
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 16]: `` To keep from getting killed , or maybe to keep from getting captured . ''
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 15]: `` But the Rebels were bad men , were n't they , Grandpa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 21]: The boy 's forehead , customarily vacant , showed some little vertical shadows , produced by a struggle to think .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 11]: `` Well , but -- '' he began , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 9]: `` Listen , Grandpa , listen here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 3]: `` Listen !
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 21]: Well , you said -- you said you never got scared the ole Rebels were goin ' to win . ''
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 12]: `` They did win pretty often , '' said the grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 9]: `` They won a good many battles . ''
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 17]: `` I mean , you said you never got scared they 'd win the war . ''
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 11]: `` No , we were never afraid of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 29]: `` Well , but if they were good men and fought like wildcats , Grandpa , and kep ' winning battles and everything , how could that be ?
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 16]: How could you _ help _ bein ' scared they 'd win the war ? ''
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 8]: The grandfather 's feeble eyes twinkled brightly .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 14]: `` Why , we _ knew _ they could n't , Ramsey . ''
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 22]: At this , the little vertical shadows on Ramsey 's forehead became more pronounced , for he had succeeded in thinking .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 17]: `` Well , _ they _ did n't know they could n't , did they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 3]: he argued .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 15]: `` They thought they were goin ' to win , did n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 8]: `` Yes , I guess they did .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 12]: Up till toward the last , I suppose they probably did .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 8]: But you see they were wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 9]: `` Well , but -- '' Ramsey struggled .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 3]: `` Listen !
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 5]: Listen here , Grandpa !
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 41]: Well , anyway , if they never got scared _ we 'd _ win , and nobody got scared _ they 'd _ win -- well , I do n't see -- '' `` You do n't see what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 56]: But Ramsey found himself unable to continue his concentration ; he slumped down upon the small of his back , and his brow relaxed to its more comfortable placidity , while his eyes wandered with a new butterfly fluttering over the irises that bordered the iron picket fence at the south side of the yard .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 11]: `` Oh , nothin ' much , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 5]: `` I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 6]: And his grandfather laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 39]: `` You mean : If the Rebels felt just as sure of winning the war as we did , and kept winning battles why should n't we ever have had any doubts that we were going to win ?
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 9]: That 's it , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 8]: `` I guess so , Grandpa . ''
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 18]: `` Well , I think it was mostly because we were certain that we were right . ''
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 8]: `` I see , '' said Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 14]: `` The Rebels knew they were on the side of the Devil . ''
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 21]: But at this , the grandfather 's laugh was louder than it had been before , and Ramsey looked hurt .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 12]: `` Well , you can laugh if you want to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 7]: he objected in an aggrieved voice .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 43]: `` Anyway , the Sunday-school sup ` intendent told us when people knew they were on the Devil 's side they always -- '' `` I dare say , I dare say , '' the old man interrupted , a little impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 19]: `` But in this world mighty few people think they 're on the Devil 's side , Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 32]: There was a Frenchman once , in olden times ; he said people were crazy because , though they could n't even make worms , they believed they could make gods .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 41]: And so whenever countries or parts of a country get into a war , each side makes a god and a devil , and says : ` God 's on our side and the Devil 's on the other . '
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 14]: The South thought the Devil was on our side , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 16]: `` Well , that kind o ' mixes it all up more 'n ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 17]: `` Yes , it seems so ; but Abraham Lincoln was n't mixed up about it .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 29]: When some people told him that God was on our side , he said the important thing was to find out if we were on God 's side .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 55]: That was the whole question , you see ; because either side could make up a god , the kind of a god they liked and wanted ; and then they 'd believe in him , too , and fight for him -- but if he was only a made-up god they 'd lose .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 32]: President Lincoln did n't want to have a made-up god on his side ; he wanted to find God Himself and find out what he wanted , and then do it .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 8]: And that 's what Lincoln did . ''
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 15]: `` Well , I do n't understand much of all _ that _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 3]: `` No ?
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 38]: Then suppose you look at it this way : The South was fighting for what it believed to be its rights , but we were n't fighting for our rights ; we were fighting for the right .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 42]: The South was fighting for what it believed to be its right to split the Union and be a country by itself ; but we were fighting for ` Liberty and Union , now and forever , one and inseparable . '
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 14]: It was n't only the Union we fought for ; it was Freedom .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 32]: The South wanted freedom to leave the Union ; but the reason the South wanted that freedom to separate from us was because _ we _ wanted the Freedom of Man .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 20]: _ There 's _ the reason we had the certain knowledge that we were going to win the war .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 8]: How plain and simple it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 6]: Ramsey did n't think so .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 85]: He had begun to feel bored by the conversation , and to undergo the oppression he usually suffered in school ; yet he took a little interest in the inexplicable increase of fervour with which his grandfather spoke , and in a shoot of sunshine which somehow got through the foliage of the walnut tree and made a bedazzlement of glinting fine lines in one spot , about the size of a saucer , upon the old man 's head of thick white hair .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 47]: Half closing his eyes , drowsily , Ramsey played that this sunshine spot was a white bird 's - next and , and he had a momentary half dream of a glittering little bird that dwelt there and wore a blue soldier cap on its head .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 17]: The earnest old voice of the veteran was only a sound in the boy 's ears .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 34]: `` Yes , it 's simple and plain enough now , though then we did n't often think of it in exactly this way , but just went on fighting and never doubted .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 60]: We knew the struggle and suffering of our fathers and grandfathers to make a great country here for Freedom , and we knew that all this was n't just the whim of a foolish god , willing to waste such great things -- we knew that such a country could n't have been building up just to be wasted .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 38]: But , more than that , we knew that armies fighting for the Freedom of Man _ had _ to win , in the long run , over armies that fought for what they considered their rights .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 17]: `` We did n't set out to free the slaves , so far as we knew .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 37]: Yet our being against slavery was what made the war , and we had the consciousness that we were on the side of God 's plan , because His plan is clearly the Freedom of Man .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 58]: Long ago we began to see the hints of His plan -- a little like the way you can see what 's coming in August from what happens in April , but man has to win his freedom from himself -- men in the light have to fight against men in the dark of their own shadow .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 16]: That light is the answer ; we had the light that made us never doubt .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 59]: Ours was the true light , and so we -- '' `` Boom -- '' The veterans had begun to fire their cannon on the crest of the low hill , out at the cemetery ; and from a little way down the street came the rat-a-tat of a toy drum and sounds of a fife played execrably .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 53]: A file of children in cocked hats made of newspapers came marching importantly up the sidewalk under the maple shade trees ; and in advance , upon a velocipede , rode a tin-sworded personage , shrieking incessant commands but not concerning himself with whether or not any military obedience was thereby obtained .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 49]: Here was a revivifying effect upon young Ramsey ; his sluggard eyelids opened electrically ; he leaped to his feet and , abandoning his grandfather without preface or apology , sped across the lawn and out of the gate , charging headlong upon the commander of the company .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 12]: `` You get off that ` locipede , Wesley Bender ! ''
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 3]: he bellowed .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 7]: `` You gim me that sword !
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 20]: What rights you got to go bein ' captain o ' my army , I 'd like to know !
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 17]: Who got up this army , in the first place , I 'd like to know !
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 30]: I did , myself yesterd ' y afternoon , and you get back in line or I wo n't let you b ` long to it at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 13]: The pretender succumbed ; he instantly dismounted , being out-shouted and overawed .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 16]: On foot he took his place in the ranks , while Ramsey became sternly vociferous .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 5]: `` In-tention , company !
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 5]: Farwud _ march _ !
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 5]: Col-lumn _ right _ !
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 5]: Right-showdler _ harms _ !
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 2]: Halt !
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 5]: Far-wud _ march _ .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 41]: Carry harms -- '' The Army went trudging away under the continuous but unheed fire of orders , and presently disappeared round a corner , leaving the veteran chuckling feebly under his walnut tree and alone with the empty street .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 24]: All trace of what he had said seemed to have been wiped from the grandson 's mind ; but memory has curious ways .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 150]: Ramsey had understood not a fifth nor a tenth of his grandfather 's talk , and already he had `` forgotten '' all of it -- yet not only were there many , many times in the boy 's later life when , without ascertainable cause , he would remember the sunlight falling upon the old man 's white head , to make that semblance of a glittering bird 's - nest there , but with the picture came recollections of words and sentences spoken by the grandfather , though the listener , half-drowsily , had heard but the sound of an old , earnest voice -- and even the veteran 's meaning finally took on a greater definiteness till it became , in the grandson 's thoughts , something clear and bright and beautiful that he knew without being just sure where or how he had learned it .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 19]: Chapter II Ramsey Milholland sat miserably in school , his conscious being consisting principally of a dull hate .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 66]: Torpor was a little dispersed during a fifteen-minute interval of `` Music , '' when he and all the other pupils in the large room of the `` Five B. Grade '' sang repeated fractions of what they enunciated as `` The Star Span-guh-hulled Banner '' ; but afterward he relapsed into the low spirits and animosity natural to anybody during enforced confinement under instruction .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 31]: No alleviation was accomplished by an invader 's temporary usurpation of the teacher 's platform , a brisk and unsympathetically cheerful young woman mounting thereon to `` teach German . ''
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 86]: For a long time mathematics and German had been about equally repulsive to Ramsey , who found himself daily in the compulsory presence of both ; but he was gradually coming to regard German with the greater horror , because , after months of patient mental resistance , he at last began to comprehend that the German language has sixteen special and particular ways of using the German article corresponding to that flexible bit of a word so easily managed English -- _ the _ .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 25]: What in the world was the use of having sixteen ways of doing a thing that could just as well be done in one ?
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 57]: If the Germans had contented themselves with insisting upon sixteen useless variations for infrequent words , such as _ hippopotamus _ , for instance , Ramsey might have thought the affair unreasonable but not necessarily vicious -- it would be easy enough to avoid talking about a hippopotamus if he ever had to go to Germany .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 98]: But the fact that the Germans picked out _ a _ and _ the _ and many other little words in use all the time , and gave every one of them sixteen forms , and expected Ramsey Milholland to learn this dizzying uselessness down to the last crotchety detail , with `` When to employ Which '' as a nausea to prepare for the final convulsion when one _ did n't _ use Which , because it was an `` Exception '' -- there was a fashion of making easy matters hard that was merely hellish .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 35]: The teacher was strict but enthusiastic ; she told the children , over and over , that German was a beautiful language , and her face always had a glow when she said this .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 69]: At such times the children looked patient ; they supposed it must be so , because she was an adult and their teacher ; and they believed her with the same manner of believing which those of them who went to Sunday-school used there when the Sunday-school teachers were pushed into explanations of various matters set forth in the Old Testament , or gave reckless descriptions of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 38]: That is to say , the children did not challenge or deny ; already they had been driven into habits of resignation and were passing out of the age when childhood is able to reject adult nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 111]: Thus , to Ramsey Milholland , the German language seemed to be a collection of perverse inventions for undeserved torment ; it was full of revolting surprises in the way of genders ; vocally it often necessitated the employment of noises suggestive of an incompletely mastered knowledge of etiquette ; and far inside him there was something faintly but constantly antagonistic to it -- yet , when the teacher declared that German was incomparably the most beautiful language in the world , one of the many facets of his mind submissively absorbed the statement as light to be passed inward ; it was part of the lesson to be learned .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 30]: He did not know whether the English language was beautiful or not ; he never thought about that , and no one ever said anything to him about it .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 33]: Moreover , though his deeper inward hated `` German , '' he liked his German teacher , and it was pleasant to look at her when that glow came upon her face .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 55]: Sometimes , too , there were moments of relaxation in her class , when she would stop the lesson and tell the children about Germany : what a beautiful , good country it was , so trim and orderly , with such pleasant customs , and all the people sensible and energetic and healthy .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 30]: There was `` Music '' again in the German class , which was another alleviation ; though it was the same old `` Star Spangled Banner '' over again .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 32]: Ramsey was tired of the song and tired of `` My Country 'T is of Thee '' ; they were bores , but it was amusing to sing them in German .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 24]: In German they sounded `` sort o ' funny , '' so he did n't mind this bit of the day 's work .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 14]: Half an hour later there arrived his supreme trial of this particular morning .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 58]: Arithmetic then being the order of business before the house , he was sent alone to the blackboard , supposedly to make lucid the proper reply to a fatal conundrum in decimals , and under the glare and focus of the whole room he breathed heavily and itched everywhere ; his brain at once became sheer hash .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 40]: He consumed as much time as possible in getting the terms of the problem stated in chalk ; then , affecting to be critical of his own handiwork , erased what he had done and carefully wrote it again .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 27]: After that , he erased half of it , slowly retraced the figures , and stepped back as if to see whether perspective improved their appearance .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 6]: Again he lifted the eraser .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 5]: `` Ramsey Milholland ! ''
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 7]: `` Put down that eraser ! ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 4]: `` Yes 'm .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 40]: I just thought -- '' Sharply bidden to get forward with his task , he explained in a feeble voice that he had first to tie a shoe string and stooped to do so , but was not permitted .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 55]: Miss Ridgely tried to stimulate him with hints and suggestion ; found him , so far as decimals went , mere protoplasm , and , wondering how so helpless a thing could live , summoned to the board little Dora Yocum , the star of the class , whereupon Ramsey moved toward his seat .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 6]: `` Stand still , Ramsey !
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 19]: You stay right where you are and try to learn something from the way Dora does it . ''
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 12]: The class giggled , and Ramsey stood , but learned nothing .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 27]: His conspicuousness was unendurable , because all of his schoolmates naturally found more entertainment in watching him than in following the performance of the capable Dora .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 56]: He put his hands in and out of his pockets ; was bidden to hold them still , also not to shuffle his feet ; and when in a false assumption of ease he would have scratched his head Miss Ridgely 's severity increased , so that he was compelled to give over the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 65]: Instructed to watch every figure chalked up by the mathematical wonder , his eyes , grown sodden , were unable to remove themselves from the part in her hair at the back of her head , where two little braids began their separate careers to end in a couple of blue-and-red checked bits of ribbon , one upon each of her thin shoulder blades .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 23]: He was conscious that the part in Dora 's shining brown hair was odious , but he was unconscious of anything arithmetical .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 28]: His sensations clogged his intellect ; he suffered from unsought notoriety , and hated Dora Yocum ; most of all he hated her busy little shoulder blades .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 33]: He had to be `` kept in '' after school ; and when he was allowed to go home he averted his eyes as he went by the house where Dora lived .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 75]: She was out in the yard , eating a doughnut , and he knew it ; but he had passed the age when it is just as permissible to throw a rock at a girl as at a boy ; and stifling his normal inclinations , he walked sturdily on , though he indulged himself so far as to engage in a murmured conversation with one of the familiar spirits dwelling somewhere within him .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 4]: `` Pfa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 20]: said Ramsey to himself -- or himself to Ramsey , since it is difficult to say which was which .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 3]: `` Pfa !
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 10]: Thinks she 's smart , do n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 15]: ... `` Well , I guess she does , but she ai n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 11]: ... `` I hate her , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 11]: ... `` You bet your life I hate her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 16]: ... `` Teacher 's Pet , that 's what _ I _ call her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 20]: ... `` Well , that 's what _ I _ call her , too , do n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 23]: `` Well , _ I _ do ; that 's all she is , anyway -- dirty ole Teacher 's Pet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 35]: Chapter III He had not forgiven her four years later when he entered high school in her company , for somehow Ramsey managed to shovel his way through examinations and stayed with the class .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 48]: By this time he had a long accumulation of reasons for hating her : Dora 's persistent and increasing competency was not short of flamboyant , and teachers naturally got the habit of flinging their quickest pupil in the face of their slowest and `` dumbest . ''
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 21]: Nevertheless , Ramsey was unable to deny that she had become less awful lookin ' than she used to be .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 34]: At least , he was honest enough to make a partial retraction when his friend and classmate , Fred Mitchell , insisted that an amelioration of Dora 's appearance could be actually proven .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 9]: `` Well , I 'll take it back .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 30]: I do n't claim she 's every last bit as awful lookin ' as she always has been , '' said Ramsey , toward the conclusion of the argument .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 27]: `` I 'll say this for her , she 's awful lookin ' , but she may not be as awful lookin ' as she was .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 72]: She do n't come to school with the edge of some of her underclo'es showin ' below her dress any more , about every other day , and her eyewinkers have got to stickin ' out some , and she may not be so abbasa_loot_ly skinny , but she 'll haf to wait a mighty long while before _ I _ want to look at her without gettin ' sick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 53]: The implication that Miss Yocum cared to have Ramsey look at her , either with or without gettin ' sick , was mere rhetoric , and recognized as such by the producer of it ; she had never given the slightest evidence of any desire that his gaze be bent upon her .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 64]: What truth lay underneath his flourish rested upon the fact that he could not look at her without some symptoms of the sort he had tersely sketched to his friend ; and yet , so pungent is the fascination of self-inflicted misery , he did look at her , during periods of study , often for three or four minutes at a stretch .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 27]: His expression at such times indeed resembled that of one who has dined unwisely ; but Dora Yocum was always too eagerly busy to notice it .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 33]: He was almost never in her eye , but she was continually in his ; moreover , as the banner pupil she was with hourly frequency an exhibit before the whole class .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 19]: Ramsey found her worst of all when her turn came in `` Declamation , '' on Friday afternoons .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 58]: When she ascended the platform , bobbed a little preliminary bow and began , `` Listen , my children , and you shall hear , '' Ramsey included Paul Revere and the Old North Church and the whole Revolutionary War in his antipathy , since they somehow appeared to be the property of the Teacher 's Pet .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 91]: For Dora held this post in `` Declamation '' as well as in everything else ; here , as elsewhere , the hateful child 's prowess surpassed that of all others ; and the teacher always entrusted her with the rendition of the `` patriotic selections '' : Dora seemed to take fire herself when she declared : `` The fate of a nation was riding that night ; And the spark struck out by that steed in his flight , Kindled the land into flame with its heat . ''
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 18]: Ramsey himself was in the same section of declaimers , and performed next -- a ghastly contrast .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 45]: He gave a `` selection from Shakespeare , '' assigned by the teacher ; and he began this continuous misfortune by stumbling violently as he ascended the platform , which stimulated a general giggle already in being at the mere calling of his name .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 25]: All of the class were bright with happy anticipation , for the miserable Ramsey seldom failed their hopes , particularly in `` Declamation . ''
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 56]: He faced them , his complexion wan , his expression both baleful and horrified ; and he began in a loud , hurried voice , from which every hint of intelligence was excluded : `` Most pottent , grave , and rev -- '' The teacher tapped sharply on her desk , and stopped him .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 11]: `` You 've forgotten to bow , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 9]: `` And do n't say ` pottent . '
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 8]: The word is ` potent ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 91]: Ramsey flopped his head at the rear wall of the room , and began again : `` Most pottent potent gray and revenerd signers my very nobe and approve good masters that I have tan away this sole man 's dutter it is mose true true I have marry dur the very headman frun tuv my fending hath this extent no more rude am I in speech -- in speech -- rude am I in speech -- in speech -- in speech -- in speech -- '' He had stalled .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 39]: Perhaps the fatal truth of that phrase , and some sense of its applicability to the occasion had interfered with the mechanism which he had set in operation to get rid of the `` recitation '' for him .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 24]: At all events , the machine had to run off its job all at once , or it would n't run at all .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 22]: Stopped , it stayed stopped , and backing off granted no new impetus , though he tried , again and again .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 17]: `` Hath this extent no more rude am I in speech -- '' He gulped audibly .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 19]: `` Rude rude rude am I -- rude am I in speech -- in speech -- in speech .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 29]: Rude am I in speech -- '' `` Yes , '' the irritated teacher said , as Ramsey 's failing voice continued huskily to insist upon this point .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 7]: `` I think you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 26]: And her nerves were a little soothed by the shout of laughter from the school -- it was never difficult for teachers to be witty .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 14]: `` Go sit down , Ramsey , and do it after school . ''
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 27]: His ears roaring , the unfortunate went to his seat , and , among all the hilarious faces , one stood out -- Dora Yocum 's .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 30]: Her laughter was precocious ; it was that of a confirmed superior , insufferably adult -- she was laughing at him as a grown person laughs at a child .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 12]: Conspicuously and unmistakably , there was something indulgent in her amusement .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 3]: He choked .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 47]: Here was a little squirt of a high-school girl who would trot up to George Washington himself and show off around him , given the opportunity ; and George Washington would probably pat her on the head , or give her a medal -- or something .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 5]: Well , let him !
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 5]: Ramsey did n't care .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 20]: He did n't care for George Washington , or Paul Revere , or Shakespeare , or any of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 11]: They could all go to the dickens with Dora Yocum .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 17]: They were all a lot of smarties anyway and he hated the whole stew of 'em !
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 36]: There was one , however , whom he somehow could n't manage to hate , even though this one officially seemed to be as intimately associated with Dora Yocum and superiority as the others were .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 25]: Ramsey could n't hate Abraham Lincoln , even when Dora was chosen to deliver the `` Gettysburg Address '' on the twelfth of February .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 16]: Vaguely , yet reassuringly , Ramsey felt that Lincoln had resisted adoption by the intellectuals .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 61]: Lincoln had said `` Government of the people , by the people , for the people , '' and that did n't mean government by the teacher and the Teacher 's Pet and Paul Revere and Shakespeare and suchlike ; it meant government by everybody , and therefore Ramsey had as much to do with it as anybody else had .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 34]: This was friendly ; and he believed that if Abraham Lincoln could have walked into the schoolroom , Lincoln would have been as friendly with him as with Dora and the teacher herself .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 43]: Beyond a doubt , Dora and the teacher _ thought _ Lincoln belonged to them and their crowd of exclusives ; they seemed to think they owned the whole United States ; but Ramsey was sure they were mistaken about Abraham Lincoln .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 29]: He felt that it was just like this little Yocum snippet to assume such a thing , and it made him sicker than ever to look at her .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 18]: Then , one day , he noticed that her eye-winkers were stickin ' out farther and farther .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 9]: Chapter IV His discovery irritated him the more .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 20]: Next thing , this ole Teacher 's Pet would do she 'd get to thinkin ' she was pretty !
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 15]: If _ that _ happened , well , nobody _ could _ stand her !
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 36]: The long lashes made her eyes shadowy , and it was a fact that her shoulder blades ceased to insist upon notoriety ; you could n't tell where they were at all , any more .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 24]: Her back seemed to be just a regular back , not made up of a lot of implements like shoulder blades and things .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 5]: A contemptible thing happened .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 36]: Wesley Bender was well known to be the most untidy boy in the class and had never shown any remorse for his reputation or made the slightest effort either to improve or to dispute it .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 19]: He was content : it failed to lower his standing with his fellows or to impress them unfavourably .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 15]: In fact , he was treated as one who has attained a slight distinction .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 23]: At least , he owned one superlative , no matter what its quality , and it lifted him out of the commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 17]: It helped him to become better known , and boys liked to be seen with him .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 54]: But one day , there was a rearrangement of the seating in the schoolroom : Wesley Bender was given a desk next in front of Dora Yocum 's ; and within a week the whole room knew that Wesley had begun voluntarily to wash his neck -- the back of it , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 46]: This was at the bottom of the fight between Ramsey Milholland and Wesley Bender , and the diplomatic exchanges immediately preceding hostilities were charmingly frank and unhyprocitical , although quite as mixed-up and off-the-issue as if they had been prepared by professional foreign office men .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 29]: Ramsey and Fred Mitchell and four other boys waylaid young Bender on the street after school , intending jocosities rather than violence , but the victim proved sensitive .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 12]: `` You take your ole hands off o ' me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 14]: he said fiercely , as they began to push him about among them .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 6]: `` Ole dirty Wes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 11]: they hoarsely bellowed and squawked , in their changing voices .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 6]: `` Washes his ears ! ''
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 7]: ... `` Washes his _ neck !
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 17]: _ '' ... `` Dora Yocum told his mama to turn the hose on him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 4]: ... `` Yay-ho !
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 10]: Ole dirty Wes tryin to be a duke ! ''
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 17]: Wesley broke from them and backed away , swinging his strapped books in a dangerous circle .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 6]: `` You keep off ! ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 4]: he warned them .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 16]: `` I got as much right to my pers ` nal appearance as anybody ! ''
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 24]: This richly fed their humour , and they rioted round him , keeping outside the swinging books at the end of the strap .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 7]: `` Pers ` nal appearance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 13]: ... `` Who went and bought it for you , Wes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 8]: ... `` Nobody bought it for him .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 9]: Dora Yocum took and give him one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 9]: `` You leave ladies ' names alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 5]: cried the chivalrous Wesley .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 17]: `` You ought to know better , on the public street , you -- pups ! ''
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 25]: Here was a serious affront , at least to Ramsey Milholland 's way of thinking ; for Ramsey , also , now proved sensitive .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 10]: He quoted his friends -- `` Shut up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 6]: -- and advanced toward Wesley .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 5]: `` You look here !
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 9]: Who you callin ' ` pups ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 4]: `` Everybody ! ''
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 4]: Wesley hotly returned .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 22]: `` Everybody that has n't got any more decency than to go around mentioning ladies ' names on the public streets .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 16]: Everybody that goes around mentioning ladies ' names on the public streets are pups ! ''
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 8]: `` They are , are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 5]: Ramsey as hotly demanded .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 49]: `` Well , you just look here a minute ; my own father mentions my mother 's name on the public streets whenever he wants to , and you just try callin ' my father a pup , and you wo n't know what happened to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 11]: `` What 'll _ you _ do about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 14]: `` I 'll put a new head on you , '' said Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 26]: `` That 's what I 'll do , because anybody that calls my father or mother a pup -- '' `` Oh , shut up !
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 11]: I was n't talking about your ole father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 22]: I said everybody that mentioned Dora Yocum 's name on the public streets was a pup , and I mean it !
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 17]: Everybody that mentions Dora Yocum 's name on the pub -- '' `` Dora Yocum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 3]: said Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 14]: `` I got a perfect right to say it anywhere I want to .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 9]: Dora Yocum , Dora Yocum , Dora Yocum !
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 13]: -- '' `` All right , then you 're a pup ! ''
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 34]: Ramsey charged upon him and received a suffocating blow full in the face , not from Mr. Bender 's fist but from the solid bundle of books at the end of the strap .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 52]: Ramsey saw eight or ten objectives instantly : there were Wesley Benders standing full length in the air on top of other Wesley Benders , and more Wesley Benders zigzagged out sideways from still other Wesley Benders ; nevertheless , he found one of these and it proved to be flesh .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 17]: He engaged it wildly at fisticuffs ; pounded it upon the countenance and drove it away .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 27]: Then he sat down upon the curbstone , and , with his dizzy eyes shut , leaned forward for the better accommodation of his ensanguined nose .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 23]: Wesley had retreated to the other side of the street holding a grimy handkerchief to the midmost parts of his pallid face .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 9]: `` There , you ole damn pup ! ''
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 11]: he shouted , in a voice which threatened to sob .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 25]: `` I guess _ that 'll _ teach you to be careful how you mention Dora Yocum 's name on the public streets ! ''
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 66]: At this , Ramsey made a motion as if to rise and pursue , whereupon Wesley fled , wailing back over his shoulder as he ran , `` You wait till I ketch you out alone on the public streets and I 'll -- '' His voice was lost in an outburst of hooting from his former friends , who sympathetically surrounded the wounded Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 16]: But in a measure , at least , the chivalrous fugitive had won his point .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 26]: He was routed and outdone , yet what survived the day was a rumour , which became a sort of tenuous legend among those interested .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 35]: There had been a fight over Dora Yocum , it appeared , and Ramsey Milholland had attempted to maintain something derogatory to the lady , while Wesley defended her as a knightly youth should .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 30]: The something derogatory was left vague ; nobody attempted to say just what it was , and the effects of the legend divided the schoolroom strictly according to gender .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 41]: The boys , unmindful of proper gallantry , supported Ramsey on account of the way he had persisted in lickin ' the stuffin ' out of Wesley Bender after receiving that preliminary wallop from Wesley 's blackjack bundle of books .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 34]: The girls petted and championed Wesley ; they talked outrageously of his conqueror , fiercely declaring that he ought to be arrested ; and for weeks they maintained a new manner toward him .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 62]: They kept their facial expressions hostile , but perhaps this was more for one another 's benefit than for Ramsey 's ; and several of them went so far out of their way to find even private opportunities for reproving him that an alert observer might have suspected them to have been less indignant than they seemed -- but not Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 15]: He thought they all hated him , and said he was glad of it .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 5]: Dora was a non-partisan .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 26]: The little prig was so diligent at her books she gave never the slightest sign of comprehending that there had been a fight about her .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 25]: Having no real cognizance of Messrs. Bender and Milholland except as impediments to the advance of learning , she did not even look demure .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 43]: Chapter V With Wesley Bender , Ramsey was again upon fair terms before the winter had run its course ; the two were neighbours and , moreover , were drawn together by a community of interests which made their reconciliation a necessity .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 10]: Ramsey played the guitar and Wesley played the mandolin .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 38]: All ill feeling between them died with the first duet of spring , yet the twinkling they made had no charm to soothe the savage breast of Ramsey whenever the Teacher 's Pet came into his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 37]: He daydreamed a thousand ways of putting her in her place , but was unable to carry out any of them , and had but a cobwebby satisfaction in imagining discomfitures for her which remained imaginary .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 21]: With a yearning so poignant that it hurt , he yearned and yearned to show her what she really was .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 5]: `` Just once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 6]: he said to Fred Mitchell .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 10]: `` That 's all I ask , just once .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 14]: Just gim me one chance to show that girl what she really is .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 30]: I guess if I ever get the chance she 'll find out what 's the matter with her , for _ once _ in her life , anyway ! ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 27]: Thus it came to be talked about and understood and expected in Ramsey 's circle , all male , that Dora Yocum 's day was coming .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 25]: The nature of the disaster was left vague , but there was no doubt in the world that retribution merely awaited its ideal opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 6]: `` You 'll see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 3]: said Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 30]: `` The time 'll come when that ole girl 'll wish she 'd moved o ' this town before she ever got appointed monitor of _ our _ class !
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 5]: Just you wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 11]: They waited , but conditions appeared to remain unfavourable indefinitely .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 51]: Perhaps the great opportunity might have arrived if Ramsey had been able to achieve a startling importance in any of the `` various divergent yet parallel lines of school endeavour '' -- one of the phrases by means of which teachers and principal clogged the minds of their unarmed auditors .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 77]: But though he was far from being the dumb driven beast of misfortune that he seemed in the schoolroom , and , in fact , lived a double life , exhibiting in his out-of-school hours a remarkable example of `` secondary personality '' -- a creature fearing nothing and capable of laughter ; blue-eyed , fairly robust , and anything but dumb -- he was nevertheless without endowment or attainment great enough to get him distinction .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 45]: He `` tried for '' the high-school eleven , and `` tried for '' the nine , but the experts were not long in eliminating him from either of these competitions , and he had to content himself with cheering instead of getting cheered .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 74]: He was by no manner of means athlete enough , or enough of anything else , to put Dora Yocum in her place , and so he and the great opportunity were still waiting in May , at the end of the second year of high school , when the class , now the `` 10 A , '' reverted to an old fashion and decided to entertain itself with a woodland picnic .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 36]: They gathered upon the sandy banks of a creek , in the blue shade of big , patchy-barked sycamores , with a dancing sky on top of everything and gold dust atwinkle over the water .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 46]: Hither the napkin-covered baskets were brought from the wagons and assembled in the shade , where they appeared as an attractive little meadow of white napery , and gave both surprise and pleasure to communities of ants and to other original settlers of the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 26]: From this nucleus or headquarters of the picnic , various expeditions set forth up and down the creek and through the woods that bordered it .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 55]: Camera work was constant ; spring wild flowers were accumulated by groups of girls who trooped through the woods with eager eyes searching the thickets ; two envied boy fishermen established themselves upon a bank up-stream , with hooks and lines thoughtfully brought with them , and poles which they fashioned from young saplings .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 35]: They took mussels from the shallows , for bait , and having gone to all this trouble , declined to share with friends less energetic and provident the perquisites and pleasures secured to themselves .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 10]: Albert Paxton was another person who proved his enterprise .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 49]: Having visited the spot some days before , he had hired for his exclusive use throughout the duration of the picnic an old rowboat belonging to a shanty squatter ; it was the only rowboat within a mile or two and Albert had his own uses for it .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 81]: Albert was the class lover and , after first taking the three chaperon teachers `` out for a row , '' an excursion concluded in about ten minutes , he disembarked them ; Sadie Clews stepped into the boat , a pocket camera in one hand , a tennis racket in the other ; and the two spent the rest of the day , except for the luncheon interval , solemnly drifting along the banks or grounded on a shoal .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 46]: Now and then Albert would row a few strokes , and at almost any time when the populated shore glanced toward them , Sadie would be seen photographing Albert , or Albert would be seen photographing Sadie , but the tennis racket remained an enigma .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 46]: Oarsman and passenger appeared to have no conversation whatever -- not once was either seen or heard to address a remark to the other ; and they looked as placid as their own upside-down reflections in one of the still pools they slowly floated over .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 15]: They were sixteen , and had been `` engaged '' more than two years .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 42]: On the borders of the little meadow of baskets there had been deposited two black shapes , which remained undisturbed throughout the day , a closed guitar case and a closed mandolin case , no doubt containing each its proper instrument .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 39]: So far as any use of these went they seemed to be of the same leisure class to which Sadie 's tennis racket belonged , for when one of the teachers suggested music , the musicians proved shy .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 49]: Wesley Bender said they had n't learned to play anything much and , besides , he had a couple o ' broken strings he did n't know as he could fix up ; and Ramsey said he guessed it seemed kind o ' too hot to play much .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 52]: Joining friends , they organized a contest in marksmanship , the target being a floating can which they assailed with pebbles ; and after that they `` skipped '' flat stones upon the surface of the water , then went to join a group gathered about Willis Parker and Heinie Krusemeyer .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 30]: No fish had been caught , a lack of luck crossly attributed by the fishermen to the noise made by constant advice on the part of their attendant gallery .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 19]: Messrs. Milholland , Bender , and the other rock throwers came up shouting , and were ill received .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 18]: `` For heaven 's sakes , '' Heinie Krusemeyer demanded , `` ca n't you shut up ?
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 41]: Here we just first got the girls to keep their mouths shut a minute and I almost had a big pickerel or something on my hook , and here you got to up and yell so he chases himself away !
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 15]: Why ca n't nobody show a little sense sometimes when they ought to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 7]: `` I should say so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 4]: his comrade exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 36]: `` If people would only just take and think of all the trouble we been to , it seems funny somebody could n't let us have half a chance to get a few good fish .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 45]: What chance they got to bite with a lot o ' _ girls _ gabbin ' away , and then , just as we get 'em quieted down , all you men got to come bustin ' up here yellin ' your heads off .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 17]: A fish is n't goin ' to bite when he ca n't even hear himself think !
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 8]: Anybody ought to know that much . ''
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 6]: But the new arrivals hooted .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 5]: _ `` Fish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 4]: _ Ramsey vociferated .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 24]: `` I 'll bet a hundred dollars there has n't been even a minny in this creek for the last sixty years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 7]: `` There is , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 5]: said Heinie , bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 22]: `` But I would n't be surprised there would n't be no longer if you got to keep up this noise .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 18]: If you 'd shut up just a minute you could see yourself there 's fish here . ''
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 25]: In whispers several of the tamed girls at once heartily corroborated this statement , whereupon the newcomers ceased to gibe and consented to silence .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 28]: Ramsey leaned forth over the edge of the overhanging bank , a dirt precipice five feet above the water , and peered into the indeterminable depths below .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 33]: The pool had been stirred , partly by the inexpert pokings of the fishermen and partly by small clods and bits of dirt dislodged from above by the feet of the audience .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 33]: The water , consequently , was but brownly translucent and revealed its secrets reluctantly ; nevertheless certain dim little shapes had been observed to move within it , and were still there .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 8]: Ramsey failed to see them at first .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 8]: `` Where 's any ole fish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 5]: he inquired , scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 7]: `` Oh , my goodness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 5]: Heinie Krusemeyer moaned . ''
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 9]: _ Ca n't _ you shut up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 4]: `` Look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 9]: whispered the girl who stood nearest to Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 3]: She pointed .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 5]: `` There 's one .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 8]: Right down there by Willis 's hook .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 7]: Do n't you see him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 7]: Ramsey was impressed enough to whisper .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 4]: `` Is there ?
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 6]: I do n't see him .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 52]: I ca n't -- '' The girl came closer to him , and , the better to show him , leaned out over the edge of the bank , and , for safety in maintaining her balance , rested her left hand upon his shoulder while she pointed with her right .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 6]: Thereupon something happened to Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 44]: The touch upon his shoulder was almost nothing , and he had never taken the slightest interest in Milla Rust -LRB- to whom that small warm hand belonged -RRB- , though she was the class beauty , and long established in the office .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 24]: Now , all at once , a peculiar and heretofore entirely unfamiliar sensation suddenly became important in the upper part of his chest .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 24]: For a moment he held his breath , an involuntary action ; -- he seemed to be standing in a shower of flowers .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 10]: `` Do n't you see it , Ramsey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 3]: Milla whispered .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 8]: `` It 's a great big one .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 13]: Why , it must be as long as -- as your shoe !
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 3]: Look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 13]: Ramsey saw nothing but the thick round curl on Milla 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 45]: Milla had a group of curls on each of her shoulders , for she got her modes at the Movies and had that sort of prettiness : large , gentle , calculating eyes , and a full , softly modelled face , implacably sweet .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 37]: Ramsey was accustomed to all this charm , and Milla had never before been of more importance to him than an equal weight of school furniture -- but all at once some magic had enveloped her .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 15]: That curl upon the shoulder nearest him was shot with dazzling fibres of sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 6]: He seemed to be trembling .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 21]: `` I do n't see it , '' he murmured , huskily , afraid that she might remove her hand .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 11]: `` I ca n't see any fish , Milla . ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 8]: She leaned farther out over the bank .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 8]: `` Why , there , goosie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 5]: `` Right there . ''
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 8]: `` I ca n't see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 10]: She leaned still farther , bending down to point .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 20]: `` Why right th -- '' At this moment she removed her hand from his shoulder , though unwillingly .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 12]: She clutched at him , in fact , but without avail .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 6]: She had been too amiable .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 53]: A loud shriek was uttered by throats abler to vocalize , just then , than Milla 's , for in her great surprise she said nothing whatever -- the shriek came from the other girls as Milla left the crest of the overhanging bank and almost horizontally disappeared into the brown water .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 32]: There was a tumultuous splash , and then of Milla Rust and her well-known beautifulness there was nothing visible in the superficial world , nor upon the surface of that creek .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 6]: The vanishment was total . ''
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 6]: _ Save _ her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 39]: Several girls afterward admitted having used this expression , and little Miss Floy Williams , the youngest and smallest member of the class , was unable to deny that she had said , `` Oh , God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 33]: Nothing could have been more natural , and the matter need not have been brought before her with such insistence and frequency , during the two remaining years of her undergraduate career .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 24]: Ramsey was one of those who heard this exclamation , later so famous , and perhaps it was what roused him to heroism .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 28]: He dived from the bank , headlong , and the strange thought in his mind was `` I guess _ this _ 'll show Dora Yocum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 48]: He should have been thinking of Milla , of course , at such a time , particularly after the little enchantment just laid upon him by Milla 's touch and Milla 's curls ; and he knew well enough that Miss Yocum was not among the spectators .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 34]: She was half a mile away , as it happened , gathering `` botanical specimens '' with one of the teachers -- which was her idea of what to do at a picnic !
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 15]: Ramsey struck the water hard , and in the same instant struck something harder .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 43]: Wesley Bender 's bundle of books had given him no such shock as he received now , and if the creek bottom had not been of mud , just there , the top of his young head might have declined the strain .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 40]: Half stunned , choking , spluttering he somehow floundered to his feet ; and when he could get his eyes a little cleared of water he found himself wavering face to face with a blurred vision of Milla Rust .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 22]: She had risen up out of the pod and stood knee deep , like a lovely drenched figure in a fountain .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 19]: Upon the bank above them , Willis Parker was jumping up and down , gesticulating and shouting fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 15]: `` Now I guess you 're satisfied our fishin ' _ is _ spoilt !
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 6]: Why n't you listen me ?
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 14]: I _ told _ you it was n't more 'n three feet deep !
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 13]: I and Heinie waded all over this creek gettin ' our bait .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 7]: You 're a pretty sight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 9]: Of Milla he spoke unwittingly the literal truth .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 44]: Even with her hair thus wild and sodden , Milla rose from immersion blushing and prettier than ever ; and she was prettiest of all when she stretched out her hand helplessly to Ramsey and he led her up out of the waters .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 29]: They had plenty of assistance to scramble to the top of the bank , and there Milla was surrounded and borne away with a great clacketing and tumult .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 48]: Ramsey gave his coat into the hands of friends , who twisted the water out of it for him , while he sat upon the grass in the sun , rubbed his head , and experimented with his neck to see if it would `` work . ''
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 72]: The sunshine was strong and hot ; in half an hour he and his clothes were dry -- or at least `` dry enough , '' as he said , and except for some soreness of head and neck , and the general crumpledness of his apparel , he seemed to be in all ways much as usual when shouts and whistlings summoned all the party to luncheon at the rendezvous .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 9]: The change that made him different was invisible .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 38]: Chapter VI The change in Ramsey was invisible , and yet something must have been seen , for everyone appeared to take it for granted that he was to sit next to Milla at the pastoral meal .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 43]: She herself understood it , evidently , for she drew in her puckered skirts and without any words make a place for him beside her as he driftingly approached her , affecting to whistle and keeping his eyes on the foliage overhead .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 13]: He still looked upward , even in the act of sitting down .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 16]: `` Squirrel or something , '' he said , feebly , as if in explanation .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 3]: Milla asked .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 8]: `` Up there on a branch . ''
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 27]: He accepted a plate from her -LRB- she had provided herself with an extra one -RRB- , but he did not look at it or her .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 16]: `` I 'm not just exactly sure it 's a squirrel , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 13]: `` Kind of hard to make out exactly what it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 32]: He continued to keep his eyes aloft , because he imagined that all of the class were looking at him and Milla , and he felt unable to meet such publicity .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 41]: It was to him as if the whole United States had been scandalized to attention by this act of his in going to sit beside Milla ; he gazed upward so long that his eyeballs became sensitive under the strain .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 5]: He began to blink .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 28]: `` I ca n't make out whether it 's a squirrel or just some leaves that kind o ' got fixed like one , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 43]: `` I ca n't make out yet which it is , but I guess when there 's a breeze , if it 's a squirrel he 'll prob ` ly hop around some then , if he 's alive or anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 34]: It had begun to seem that his eyes must remain fixed in that upward stare forever ; he wanted to bring them down , but could not face the glare of the world .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 42]: So the fugitive ostrich is said to bury his head in the sand ; he does it , not believing himself thereby hidden but trying to banish from his own cognizance terrible facts which his unsheltered eyes have seemed to reveal .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 22]: So , too , do nervous children seek to bury their eyes under pillows , and nervous statesmen theirs under oratory .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 8]: Ramsey 's ostrichings can happen to anybody .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 30]: But finally the brightness of the sky between the leaves settled matters for him ; he sneezed , wept , and for a little moment again faced his fellowmen .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 16]: No one was looking at him ; everybody except Milla had other things to do .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 17]: Having sneezed involuntarily , he added a spell of coughing for which there was no necessity .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 13]: `` I guess I must be wrong , '' he muttered thickly .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 7]: `` What about , Ramsey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 9]: `` About it bein ' a squirrel . ''
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 42]: With infinite timidity he turned his head and encountered a gaze so soft , so hallowed , that it disconcerted him , and he dropped a `` drumstick '' of fried chicken , well dotted with ants , from his plate .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 12]: Scarlet he picked it up , but did not eat it .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 24]: For the first time in his life he felt that eating fried chicken held in the fingers was not to be thought of .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 26]: He replaced the `` drumstick '' upon his plate and allowed it to remain there untouched , in spite of a great hunger for it .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 38]: Having looked down , he now found difficulty in looking up , but gazed steadily at his plate , and into this limited circle of vision came Milla 's delicate and rosy fingers , bearing a gift .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 12]: `` There , '' she said in a motherly little voice .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 13]: `` It 's a tomato mayonnaise sandwich and I made it myself .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 10]: I want you to eat it , Ramsey . ''
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 20]: His own fingers approached tremulousness as he accepted the thick sandwich from her and conveyed it to his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 39]: A moment later his soul filled with horror , for a spurt of mayonnaise dressing had caused a catastrophe the scene of which occupied no inconsiderable area of his right cheek ; which was the cheek toward Milla .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 17]: He groped wretchedly for his handkerchief but could not find it ; he had lost it .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 31]: Sudden death would have been relief ; he was sure that after such grotesquerie Milla could never bear to have anything more to do with him ; he was ruined .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 31]: In his anguish he felt a paper napkin pressed gently into his hand ; a soft voice said in his ear , `` Wipe it off with this , Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 5]: Nobody 's noticing . ''
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 19]: So this incredibly charitable creature was still able to be his friend , even after seeing him mayonnaised !
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 16]: Humbly marvelling , he did as she told him , but avoided all further risks .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 5]: He ate nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 25]: He sighed his first sigh of inexpressibleness , had a chill or so along the spine , and at intervals his brow was bedewed .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 26]: Within his averted eyes there dwelt not the Milla Rust who sat beside him , but an iridescent , fragile creature who had become angelic .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 33]: He spent the rest of the day dawdling helplessly about her ; wherever she went he was near , as near as possible , but of no deliberate volition of his own .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 14]: Something seemed to tie him to her , and Milla was nothing loth .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 28]: He seldom looked at her directly , or for longer than an instant , and more rarely still did he speak to her except as a reply .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 81]: What few remarks he ventured upon his own initiative nearly all concerned the landscape , which he commended repeatedly in a weak voice , as `` kind of pretty , '' though once he said he guessed there might be bugs in the bark of a log on which they sat ; and he became so immoderately personal as to declare that if the bugs had to get on anybody he 'd rather they got on him than on Milla .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 59]: She said that was `` just perfectly lovely '' of him , asked where he got his sweet nature , and in other ways encouraged him to continue the revelation , but Ramsey was unable to get forward with it , though he opened and closed his mouth a great many times in the effort to do so .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 37]: At five o'clock everybody was summoned again to the rendezvous for a ceremony preliminary to departure : the class found itself in a large circle , standing , and sang `` The Star Spangled Banner . ''
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 62]: Ordinarily , on such an open-air and out-of-school occasion , Ramsey would have joined the chorus uproariously with the utmost blatancy of which his vocal apparatus was capable ; and most of the other boys expressed their humour by drowning out the serious efforts of the girls ; but he sang feebly , not much more than humming through his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 26]: Standing beside Milla , he was incapable of his former inelegancies and his voice was in a semi-paralyzed condition , like the rest of him .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 27]: Opposite him , across the circle , Dora Yocum stood a little in advance of those near her , for of course she led the singing .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 44]: Her clear and earnest voice was distinguishable from all others , and though she did not glance toward Ramsey he had a queer feeling that she was assuming more superiority than ever , and that she was icily scornful of him and Milla .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 17]: The old resentment rose -- he 'd `` show '' that girl yet , some day !
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 74]: When the song was over , cheers were given for the class , `` the good ole class of Nineteen Fourteen , '' the school , the teachers , and for the picnic , thus officially concluded ; and then the picnickers , carrying their baskets and faded wild flowers and other souvenirs and burdens , moved toward the big `` express wagons '' which were to take them back into the town .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 11]: Ramsey got his guitar case , and turned to Milla .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 7]: `` Well -- '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 7]: `` Well what , Ramsey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 8]: `` Well -- g ` bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 9]: `` Why , no , '' said Milla .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 5]: `` Anyways not yet .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 11]: You can go back in the same wagon with me .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 28]: It 's going to stop at the school and let us out there , and then you could walk home with me if you felt like it .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 26]: You could come all the way to our gate with me , I expect , unless you 'd be late home for your supper . ''
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 15]: `` Well -- well , I 'd be perfectly willing , '' Ramsey said .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 42]: `` Only I heard we all had to go back in whatever wagon we came out in , and I did n't come in the same wagon with you , so -- '' Milla laughed and leaned toward him a little .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 13]: `` I already ` tended to that , '' she said confidentially .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 27]: `` I asked Johnnie Fiske , that came out in my wagon , to go back in yours , so that makes room for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 12]: `` Well -- then I guess I could do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 8]: He moved toward the wagon with her .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 16]: `` I expect it do n't make much difference one way or the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 38]: `` And you can carry my basket if you want to , '' she said , adding solicitously , `` Unless it 's too heavy when you already got your guitar case to carry , Ramsey . ''
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 12]: This thoughtfulness of hers almost overcame him ; she seemed divine .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 17]: He gulped , and emotion made him even pinker than he had been under the mayonnaise .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 18]: `` I -- I 'll be glad to carry the basket , too , '' he faltered .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 9]: `` It-it do n't weigh anything much . ''
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 16]: `` Well , let 's hurry , so 's we can get places together . ''
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 56]: Then , as she manoeuvred him through the little crowd about the wagon , with a soft push this way and a gentle pull that , and hurried him up the improvised steps and found a place where there was room for them to sit , Ramsey had another breathless sensation heretofore unknown to him .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 21]: He found himself taken under a dovelike protectorship ; a wonderful , inexpressible Being seemed to have become his proprietor .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 9]: `` Is n't this just perfectly lovely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 9]: she said cozily , close to his ear .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 21]: He swallowed , but found no words , for he had no thoughts ; he was only an incoherent tumult .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 6]: This was his first love .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 8]: `` Is n't it , Ramsey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 3]: she urged .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 11]: The cozy voice had just the hint of a reproach .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 14]: `` Do n't you think it 's just perfectly lovely , Ramsey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 5]: `` Yes 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 45]: Chapter VII The next morning Ramsey came into his father 's room while Mr. Milholland was shaving , an hour before church time , and it became apparent that the son had someting on his mind , though for a while he said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 9]: `` Did you want anything , Ramsey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 14]: `` Well -- '' `` Did n't want to borrow my razors ? ''
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 6]: `` No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 4]: Mr. Milholland chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 8]: `` I hardly supposed so , seriously !
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 17]: Shaving is a great nuisance and the longer you keep away from it , the better .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 15]: And when you do , you let my razors alone , young feller ! ''
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 26]: -LRB- Mr. Milholland 's razors were safe , Ramsey had already achieved one of his own , but he practised the art in secret . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 32]: He passed his hand thoughtfully over his cheeks , and traces of white powder were left upon his fingers , whereupon he wiped his hand surreptitiously , and stood irresolutely waiting .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 11]: `` What is it you really want , Ramsey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 10]: `` I guess I do n't want anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 4]: `` Money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 8]: You gay ' me some Friday . ''
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 18]: Mr. Milholland turned from his mirror and looked over the edge of a towel at his son .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 21]: In the boy 's eyes there was such a dumb agony of interrogation that the father was a little startled .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 9]: `` Why , what is it , Ramsey ?
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 11]: Have you -- '' He paused , frowning and wondering .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 20]: `` You have n't been getting into some mess you want to tell me about , have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 6]: `` No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 30]: His tone was meek , but a mute distress lurked within it , bringing to the father 's mind disturbing suspicions , and foreshadowings of indignation and of pity .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 37]: `` See here , Ramsey , '' he said , `` if there 's anything you want to ask me , or to tell me , you 'd better out with it and get it over .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 7]: Now , what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 9]: `` Well -- it is n't anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 6]: `` Are you _ sure ?
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 16]: _ '' Ramsey 's eyes fell before the severe and piercing gaze of his father .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 33]: Mr. Milholland shook his head doubtfully ; then , as his son walked slowly out of the room , he turned to complete his toilet in a somewhat uneasy frame of mind .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 35]: Ramsey had undoubtedly wanted to say something to him and the boy 's expression had shown that the matter in question was serious , distressing , and , it might be , even critical .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 8]: In fact it was -- to Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 57]: Having begun within only the last few hours to regard haberdashery as of vital importance , and believing his father to be possessed of the experience and authority lacking in himself , Ramsey had come to get him to settle a question which had been upsetting him badly , in his own room , since breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 47]: What he want to know was : Whether it was right to wear an extra handkerchief showing out of the coat breast pocket or not , and , if it was right -- ought the handkerchief to have a coloured border or to be plain white ?
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 23]: But he had never before brought any such perplexities to his father , and found himself too diffident to set them forth .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 50]: However , when he left the house , a few minutes later , he boldly showed an inch of purple border above the pocket ; then , as he was himself about to encounter several old lady pedestrians , he blushed and thrust the handkerchief down into deep concealment .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 36]: Having gone a block farther , he pulled it up again ; and so continued to operate this badge of fashion , or unfashion , throughout the morning ; and suffered a great deal thereby .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 38]: Meantime , his father , rather relieved that Ramsey had not told his secret , whatever it was , dismissed the episode from his mind and joined Mrs. Milholland at the front door , ready for church .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 6]: `` Where 's Ramsey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 18]: `` He 's gone ahead , '' she answered , buttoning her gloves as they went along .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 11]: `` I heard the door quite a little while ago .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 12]: Perhaps he went over to walk down with Charlotte and Vance .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 11]: Did you notice how neat he looks this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 12]: `` Why , no , I did n't ; not particularly .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 4]: Does he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 14]: `` I never saw anything like it before , '' said Mrs. Milholland .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 14]: `` He went down in the cellar and polished his own shoes . ''
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 21]: `` For about an hour , I think , '' she said , as one remaining calm before a miracle .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 19]: `` And he only has three neckties , but I saw him several times in each of them .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 8]: He must have kept changing and changing .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 7]: I wonder -- '' She paused .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 18]: `` I 'm glad he 's begun to take a little care of his appearance at last .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 23]: Business men think a good deal about that , these days , when he comes to make his start in the world .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 17]: I 'll have to take a look at him and give him a word of praise .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 14]: I suppose he 'll be in the pew when we get there . ''
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 31]: But Ramsey was n't in the pew ; and Charlotte , his sister , and her husband , who were there , said they had n't seen anything of him .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 25]: It was not until the members of the family were on their way home after the services that they caught a glimpse of him .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 65]: They were passing a church a little distance from their own ; here the congregation was just emerging to the open , and among the sedate throng descending the broad stone steps appeared an accompanied Ramsey -- and a red , red Ramsey he was when he beheld his father and mother and sister and brother-in-law staring up at him from the pavement below .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 34]: They were kind enough not to come to an absolute halt , but passed slowly on , so that he was just able to avoid parading up the street in front of them .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 42]: The expressions of his father , mother , and sister were of a dumfoundedness painful to bear , while such lurking jocosity as that apparent all over his brother-in-law no dignified man should either exhibit or be called upon to ignore .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 16]: In hoarse whispers , Mrs. Milholland chided her husband for an exclamation he had uttered .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 3]: `` John !
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 3]: On Sunday !
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 7]: You ought to be ashamed . ''
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 11]: `` I could n't help it , '' he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 9]: `` Who on earth is his clinging vine ?
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 22]: Why , she 's got _ lavender _ tops on her shoes and -- '' `` Do n't look round ! ''
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 5]: she warned him sharply .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 17]: `` Do n't -- '' `` Well , what 's he doing at a Baptist church ?
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 9]: What 's he fidgeting at his handkerchief about ?
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 8]: Why ca n't he walk like people ?
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 20]: Does he think it 's obligatory to walk home from church anchored arm-in-arm like Swedes on a Sunday Out ?
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 16]: Who _ is _ this cow-eyed fat girl that 's got him , anyhow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 3]: `` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 9]: Do n't look round again , John . ''
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 5]: `` Never fear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 7]: said her husband , having disobeyed .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 14]: `` They 've turned off ; they 're crossing over to Bullard Street .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 5]: Who is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 14]: `` I think her name 's Rust , '' Mrs. Milholland informed him .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 10]: `` I do n't know what her father does .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 13]: She 's one of the girls in his class at school . ''
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 21]: `` Well , that 's just like a boy ; pick out some putty-faced flirt to take to church ! ''
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 13]: `` Oh , she 's quite pretty -- in that way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 6]: said his wife , deprecatingly .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 11]: `` Of course that 's the danger with public schools .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 22]: It would be pleasanter if he 'd taken a fancy to someone whose family belongs to our own circle . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 7]: ` Taken a fancy ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 5]: he echoed , hooting .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 7]: `` Why , he 's terrible !
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 15]: He looked like a red-gilled goldfish that 's flopped itself out of the bowl .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 74]: Why , he -- '' `` I _ say _ I wish if he felt that he had to take girls anywhere , '' said Mrs. Milholland , with the primmest air of speaking to the point -- `` if this sort of thing _ must _ begin , I wish he might have selected some nice girl among the daughters of our own friends , like Dora Yocum , for instance . ''
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 37]: Upon the spot she began to undergo the mortification of a mother who has expected her son , just out of infancy , to look about him with the eye of a critical matron of forty-five .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 30]: Moreover , she was indiscreet enough to express her views to Ramsey , a week later , producing thus a scene of useless great fury and no little sound .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 183]: `` I do think it 's in _ very _ poor taste to see so much of any one girl , Ramsey , '' she said , and , not heeding his protest that he only walked home from school with Milla , `` about every other day , '' and that it did n't seem any crime to him just to go to church with her a couple o ' times , Mrs. Milholland went on : `` But if you think you really _ must _ be dangling around somebody quite this much -- though what in the world you find to _ talk _ about with this funny little Milla Rust you poor father says he really can not see -- and of course it seems very queer to us that you 'd be willing to waste so much time just now when your mind ought to be entirely on your studies , and especially with such an absurd _ looking _ little thing -- `` No , you must listen , Ramsey , and let me speak now .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 80]: What I meant was that we should n't be _ quite _ so much distressed by your being seen with a girl who dressed in better taste and seemed to have some notion of refinement , though of course it 's only natural she _ would n't _ , with a father who is just a sort of ward politician , I understand , and a mother we do n't know , and of course should n't care to .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 6]: But , oh , Ramsey !
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 23]: if you _ had _ to make yourself so conspicuous why could n't you be a little _ bit _ more fastidious ?
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 19]: Your father would n't have minded nearly so much if it had been a self-respecting , intellectual girl .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 47]: We both say that if you _ must _ be so ridiculous at your age as to persist in seeing more of one girl than another , why , oh why , do n't you go and see some really nice girl like Dora Yocum ? ''
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 60]: Ramsey was already dangerously distended , as an effect of the earlier part of her discourse , and the word `` fastidious '' almost exploded him ; but upon the climax , `` Dora Yocum , '' he blew up with a shattering report and , leaving fragments of incoherence ricocheting behind him , fled shuddering from the house .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 25]: For the rest of the school term he walked home with Milla every afternoon and on sundays appeared to have become a resolute Baptist .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 22]: It was supposed -LRB- by the interested members of the high-school class -RRB- that Ramsey and Milla were `` engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 27]: Ramsey sometimes rather supposed they were himself , and the dim idea gave him a sensation partly pleasant , but mostly apprehensive : he was afraid .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 15]: He was afraid that the day was coming when he ought to kiss her .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 24]: Chapter VIII Vacation , in spite of increased leisure , may bring inconvenience to people in Ramsey 's strange but not uncommon condition .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 53]: At home his constant air was that of a badgered captive plaintively silent under injustice ; and he found it difficult to reply calmly when asked where he was going -- an inquiry addressed to him , he asserted , every time he touched his cap , even to hang it up !
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 30]: The amount of evening walking he did must also have been a trial to his nerves , on account of fatigue , though the ground covered was not vast .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 76]: Milla 's mother and father were friendly people but saw no reason to `` move out of house and home , '' as Mr. Rust said , when Milla had `` callers '' ; and on account of the intimate plan of their small dwelling a visitor 's only alternative to spending the evening with Mr. and Mrs. Rust as well as with Milla , was to invite her to `` go out walking . ''
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 60]: Evening after evening they walked and walked and walked , usually in company -- at perhaps the distance of half a block -- with Albert Paxton and Sadie Clews , though Ramsey now and then felt disgraced by having fallen into this class ; for sometimes it was apparent that Albert casually had his arm about Sadie 's waist .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 10]: This allured Ramsey somewhat , but terrified him more .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 10]: He did n't know how such matters were managed .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 38]: Usually the quartet had no destination ; they just went `` out walking '' until ten o'clock , when both girls had to be home -- and the boys did , too , but never admitted it .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 27]: On Friday evenings there was a `` public open-air concert '' by a brass band in a small park , and the four were always there .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 25]: A political speechmaker occupied the bandstand one night , and they stood for an hour in the midst of the crowd , listening vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 8]: The orator saddled his politics upon patriotism .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 34]: `` Do you intend to let this glorious country go to wrack and ruin , oh , my good friends , '' he demanded , `` or do you intend to save her ?
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 24]: Look forth upon this country of ours , I bid you , oh , my countrymen , and tell me what you see .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 22]: You see a fair domain of forest , mountain , plain , and fertile valleys , sweeping from ocean to ocean .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 105]: Look from the sturdy rocks of old New England , pledged to posterity by the stern religious hardihood of the Pilgrim Fathers , across the corn-bearing midland country , that land of milk and honey , won for us by the pluck and endurance of the indomitable pioneers , to where in sunshine roll the smiling Sierras of golden California , given to our heritage by the unconquerable energy of those brave men and women who braved the tomahawk on the Great Plains , the tempest , of Cape Horn , and the fevers of Panama , to make American soil of El Dorado !
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 2]: America !
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 10]: Oh , my America , how glorious you stand !
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 15]: Country of Washington and Valley Forge , out of what martyrdoms hast thou arisen !
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 32]: Country of Lincoln in his box at Ford 's theatre , his lifeblood staining to a brighter , holier red the red , white , and blue of the Old Flag !
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 24]: Always and always I see the Old Flag fluttering the more sacredly encrimsoned in the breeze for the martyrs who have upheld it !
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 22]: Always I see that Old Flag -- '' Milla gave Ramsey 's arm , within her own , a little tug .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 8]: `` Come on , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 14]: `` Sade says she do n't want to hang around here any longer .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 5]: It 's awful tiresome .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 5]: Let 's go . ''
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 5]: He consented , placidly .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 14]: The oration meant nothing to him and stirred no one in the audience .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 41]: The orator was impassioned ; he shouted himself into coughing fits , gesticulated , grew purple ; he was so hot that his collar caved in and finally swooned upon his neck in soggy exhaustion , prostrate round his thunderings .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 21]: Meanwhile , the people listened with an air of patience , yawning here and there , and gradually growing fewer .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 43]: It was the old , old usual thing , made up of phrases that Ramsey had heard dinning away on a thousand such occasions , and other kinds of occasions , until they meant to him no more than so much sound .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 9]: He was bored , and glad to leave .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 22]: `` Kind o ' funny , '' he said , as they sagged along the street at their usual tortoise gait .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 8]: `` What is it , Ramsey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 20]: `` Seems kind o ' funny they never have anything to say any one can take any interest in .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 15]: Always the same ole whoopety-whoop about George Washington and Pilgrim Fathers and so on .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 47]: I bet five dollars before long we 'd of heard him goin ' on about our martyred Presidents , William McKinley and James A. Garfield and Benjamin Harrison and all so on , and then some more about the ole Red , White , and Blue .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 20]: Do n't you wish they 'd _ quit _ , sometimes , about the ` Ole Flag ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 8]: `` I dunno , '' said Milla .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 9]: `` I was n't listening any at all .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 5]: I hate speeches . ''
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 30]: `` Well , I could _ stand _ 'em , '' Ramsey said , more generously , `` if they 'd ever give anybody a little to think about .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 15]: What 's the use always draggin ' in George Warshington and the Ole Flag ?
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 43]: And who wants to hear any more ole truck about ` from ole rocky New England to golden California , ' and how big and fine the United States is and how it 's the land of the Free and all that ?
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 9]: Why do n't they ever say anything new ?
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 10]: That 's what I 'd like to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 26]: Milla laughed , and when he asked why , she told him she 'd never heard him talk so much `` at one stretch . ''
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 16]: `` I guess that speech got you kind of wound up , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 9]: `` Let 's talk about something different . ''
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 9]: `` I just soon , '' he agreed .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 14]: And so they walked on in silence , which seemed to suit Milla .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 26]: She hung weightily upon his arm , and they dawdled , drifting from one side of the pavement to the other as they slowly advanced .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 41]: Ablert and Sadie , ahead of them , called `` good-night '' from a corner , before turning down the side street where Sadie lived ; and then , presently , Ramsey and Milla were at the latter 's gate .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 12]: He went in with her , halting at the front steps .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 13]: `` Well , g ` night , Milla , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 9]: `` Want to go out walking to-morrow night ?
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 6]: Albert and Sadie are . ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 15]: `` I ca n't to-morrow night , '' she told him with obvious regret .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 8]: `` Is n't it the worst luck !
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 39]: I got an aunt comin ' to visit from Chicago , and she 's crazy about playing ` Five Hundred , ' and Mama and Papa said I haf to stay in to make four to play it .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 29]: She 's liable to be here three or four days , and I guess I got to be around home pretty much all the time she 's here .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 7]: It 's the worst luck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 10]: He was doleful , but ventured to be literary .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 12]: `` Well , what ca n't be helped must be endured .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 10]: I 'll come around when she 's gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 21]: He moved as if to depart , but she still retained his arm and did not prepare to relinquish it .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 7]: `` Well -- '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 7]: `` Well what , Ramsey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 8]: `` Well -- g ` night . ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 11]: She glanced up at the dark front of the house .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 16]: `` I guess the family 's gone to bed , '' she said , absently .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 8]: `` I s ` pose so . ''
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 8]: `` Well , good-night , Ramsey . ''
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 28]: She said this but still did not release his arm , and suddenly , in a fluster , he felt that the time he dreaded had come .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 29]: Somehow , without knowing where , except that it was somewhere upon what seemed to be a blurred face too full of obstructing features , he kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 29]: She turned instantly away in the darkness , her hands over her cheeks ; and in a panic Ramsey wondered if he had n't made a dreadful mistake .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 5]: `` S'cuse me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 8]: he said , stumbling toward the gate .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 16]: `` Well , I guess I got to be gettin ' along back home . ''
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 18]: Chapter IX He woke in the morning to a great self-loathing : he had kissed a girl .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 25]: Mingled with the loathing was a curious pride in the very fact that caused the loathing , but the pride did not last long .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 13]: He came downstairs morbid to breakfast , and continued this mood afterward .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 20]: At noon Albert Paxton brought him a note which Milla had asked Sadie to ask Albert to give him .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 26]: Dearie : I am just wondering if you thought as much about something so sweet that happened last night as I did you know what .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 8]: I think it was the sweetest thing .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 19]: I send you one with this note and I hope you will think it is a sweet one .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 31]: I would give you a real one if you were here now and I hope you would think it was sweeter still than the one I put in this note .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 16]: It is the sweetest thing now you are mine and I am yours forever kiddo .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 13]: If you come around about friday eve it will be all right .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 26]: aunt Jess will be gone back home by then so come early and we will get Sade and Alb and go to the band Concert .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 54]: Do n't forget what I said about my putting something sweet in this note , and I hope you will think it is a sweet one but not as sweet as the _ real _ sweet one I would like to -- At this point Ramsey impulsively tore the note into small pieces .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 48]: He turned cold as his imagination projected a sketch of his mother in the act of reading this missive , and of her expression as she read the sentence : `` It is the sweetest thing now you are mine and I am yours forever kiddo . ''
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 11]: He wished that Milla had n't written `` kiddo . ''
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 25]: She called him that , sometimes , but in her warm little voice the word seemed not at all what it did in ink .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 15]: He wished , too , that she had n't said she was his forever .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 10]: Suddenly he was seized with a horror of her .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 29]: Moisture broke out heavily upon him ; he felt a definite sickness , and , wishing for death , went forth upon the streets to walk and walk .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 38]: He cared not whither , so that his feet took him in any direction away from Milla , since they were unable to take him away from himself -- of whom he had as great a horror .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 16]: Her loving face was continually before him , and its sweetness made his flesh creep .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 6]: Milla had been too sweet .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 28]: When he met or passed people , it seemed to him that perhaps they were able to recognize upon him somewhere the marks of his low quality .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 3]: `` Softy !
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 5]: Ole sloppy fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 6]: he muttered , addressing himself .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 5]: `` Slushy ole mush !
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 4]: ... _ Spooner !
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 13]: _ '' And he added , `` Yours forever , kiddo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 7]: Convulsions seemed about to seize him .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 15]: Turning a corner with his head down , he almost charged into Dora Yocum .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 51]: She was homeward bound from a piano lesson , and carried a rolled leather case of sheet music -- something he could n't imagine Milla carrying -- and in her young girl 's dress , which attempted to be nothing else , she looked as wholesome as cold spring water .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 22]: Ramsey had always felt that she despised him and now , all at once , he thought that she was justified .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 18]: Leper that he had become , he was unworthy to be even touching his cap to her !
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 36]: And as she nodded and went briskly on , he would have given anything to turn and walk a little way with her , for it seemed to him that this might fumigate his morals .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 21]: But he lacked the courage , and , besides , he considered himself unfit to be seen walking with her .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 26]: He had a long afternoon of anguishes , these becoming most violent when he tried to face the problem of his future course toward Milla .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 46]: He did not face it at all , in fact , but merely writhed , and had evolved nothing when Friday evening was upon him and Milla waiting for him to take her to the `` band concert '' with `` Alb and Sade . ''
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 44]: In his thoughts , by that time , this harmless young pair shared the contamination of his own crime , and he regarded them with aversion ; however , he made shift to seek a short interview with Albert , just before dinner .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 27]: `` I got a pretty rotten headache , and my stomach 's upset , too , '' he said , drooping upon the Paxton 's fence .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 9]: `` I been gettin ' worse every minute .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 38]: You and Sadie go by Milla 's , Albert , and tell her if I 'm not there by ha ' - pas ' - seven , tell her not to wait for me any longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 10]: `` How do you mean ` wait ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 3]: Albert inquired .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 19]: `` You do n't expect her to come pokin ' along with Sadie and me , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 34]: She 'll keep on sittin ' there at home just the same , because she would n't have anything else to do , if you do n't come like she expects you to .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 14]: She has n't got any way to _ stop _ waitin ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 9]: At this , Ramsey moaned , without affectation .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 16]: `` I do n't expect I _ can _ , Albert , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 41]: `` I 'd like to if I could , but the way it looks now , you tell her I would n't be much surprised maybe I was startin ' in with typhoid fever or pretty near anything at all .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 72]: You tell her I 'm pretty near as disappointed as she 's goin ' to be herself , and I 'd come if I could -- and I _ will _ come if I get a good deal better , or anything -- but the way it 's gettin ' to look now , I kind o ' feel as if I might be breaking out with something any minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 28]: He moved away , concluding , feebly : `` I guess I better crawl on home , Albert , while I 'm still able to walk some .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 17]: You tell her the way it looks now I 'm liable to be right sick . ''
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 59]: And the next morning he woke to the chafings of remorse , picturing a Milla somewhat restored in charm waiting hopefully at the gate , even after half-past seven , and then , as time passed and the sound of the distant horns came faintly through the darkness , going sadly to her room -- perhaps weeping there .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 31]: It was a picture to wring him with shame and pity , but was followed by another which electrified him , for out of school he did not lack imagination .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 12]: What if Albert had reported his illness too vividly to Milla ?
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 5]: Milla was so fond !
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 22]: What if , in her alarm , she should come here to the house to inquire of his mother about him ?
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 12]: What if she told Mrs. Milholland they were `` engaged '' ?
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 44]: The next moment Ramsey was projecting a conversation between his mother and Milla in which the latter stated that she and Ramsey were soon to be married ; that she regarded him as already virtually her husband , and demanded to nurse him .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 37]: In a panic he fled from the house before breakfast , going out by way of a side door , and he crossed back yards and climbed back fences to reach Albert Paxton the more swiftly .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 39]: This creature , a ladies ' man almost professionally , was found exercising with an electric iron and a pair of flannel trousers in a basement laundry , by way of stirring his appetite for the morning meal .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 12]: `` See here , Albert , '' his friend said breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 6]: `` I got a favour .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 27]: I want you to go over to Milla 's -- '' `` I 'm goin ' to finish pressin ' these trousers , '' Albert interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 11]: `` Then I 've got my breakfast to eat . ''
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 15]: `` Well , you could do this first , '' said Ramsey , hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 14]: `` It would n't hurt you to do me this little favour first .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 47]: You just slip over and see Milla for me , if she 's up yet , and if she is n't , you better wait around there till she is , because I want you to tell her I 'm a whole lot better this morning .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 39]: Tell her I 'm pretty near practick ` ly all right again , Albert , and I 'll prob ` ly write her a note or something right soon -- or in a week or so , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 14]: You tell her -- '' `` Well , you act pretty funny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 11]: Albert exclaimed , fumbling in the pockets of his coat .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 14]: `` Why ca n't you go on over and tell her yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 8]: `` I would , '' said Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 19]: `` I 'd be perfectly willing to go only I got to get back home to breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 3]: Albert stared .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 22]: `` Well , I got to go upstairs and eat my own breakfast in about a minute , have n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 23]: But just as it happens there would n't be any use your goin ' over there , or me , either . ''
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 18]: `` Milla ai n't there , '' said Albert , still searching the pockets of his coat .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 64]: `` When we went by her house last night to tell her about your headache and stomach and all , why , her mother told us Milla 'd gone up to Chicago yesterday afternoon with her aunt , and said she left a note for you , and she said if you were sick I better take it and give it to you .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 15]: I was goin ' to bring it over to your house after breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 4]: He found it .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 4]: `` Here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 25]: Ramsey thanked him feebly , and departed in a state of partial stupefaction , brought on by a glimpse of the instabilities of life .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 29]: He had also , not relief , but a sense of vacancy and loss ; for Milla , out of his reach , once more became mysteriously lovely .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 10]: Pausing in an alley , he read her note .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 63]: Dearie : Thought I ought to call you up but over the ` phone is just nix for explanations as Mama and Aunt Jess would hear everything and thought I might seem cold to you not saying anything sweet on account of them listening and you would wonder why I was so cold when telling you good-by for a wile maybe weeks .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 46]: It is this way Uncle Purv wired Aunt Jess he has just taken in a big touring car on a debt and his vacation starts to-morrow so if they were going to take a trip they better start right way so Aunt Jess invited me .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 54]: It is going to be a big trip up around the lakes and I have always wanted to go touring more than anything in the world stopping at hotels and all and Mama said I ought to it would be so splendid for my health as she thinks I am failing some lately .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 28]: Now dearie I have to pack and write this in a hurry so you will not be disappointed when you come by for the B. C. to-night .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 31]: Do not go get some other girl and take her for I would hate her and nothing in this world make me false for one second to my kiddo boy .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 35]: I do not know just when home again as the folks think I better stay up there for a visit at Aunt Jess and Uncle Purvs home in Chicago after the trip is over .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 33]: But I will think of you all the time and you must think of me every minute and believe your own dearie she will never no not for one second be false .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 38]: So tell Sade and Alb good-by for me and do not be false to me any more than I would be to you and it will not be long till nothing more will interrupt our sweet friendship .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 35]: As a measure of domestic prudence , Ramsey tore the note into irreparable fragments , but he did this slowly , and without experiencing any of the revulsion created by Milla 's former missive .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 12]: He was melancholy , aggrieved that she should treat him so .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 8]: Chapter X He never saw her again .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 36]: She sent him a `` picture postal '' from Oconomowoc , Wisconsin , which his father disengaged from the family mail , one morning at breakfast , and considerately handed to him without audible comment .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 13]: Upon it was written , _ `` Oh , you Ramsey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 8]: _ This was the last of Milla .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 15]: Just before school opened , in the autumn , Sadie Clews made some revelations .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 10]: `` Milla did like you , '' said Sadie .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 45]: `` After that time you jumped in the creek to save her she liked you better than any boy in town , and I guess if it was n't for her cousin Milt up in Chicago she would of liked you the best anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 19]: I guess she did , anyway , because she had n't seen him for about a year then .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 39]: `` Well , that afternoon she went away I was over there and took in everything that was goin ' on , only she made me promise on my word of honour I would n't even tell Albert .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 43]: They did n't get any wire from her uncle about the touring car ; it was her cousin Milt that jumped on the train and came down and fixed it all up for Milla to go on the trip , and everything .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 58]: You see , Ramsey , she was turned back a couple of times in school before she came in our class and I do n't exactly know how old she is and she do n't _ look _ old yet , but I 'm pretty sure she 's at least eighteen , and she might be over .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 32]: Her mother kept tellin ' her all the time you were just a kid , and did n't have anything to support her on , and lots of things like that .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 42]: I did n't think such a great deal of this Milt 's looks , myself , but he 's anyway twenty-one years old , and got a good position , and all their family seem to think he 's just fine !
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 28]: It was n't his father that took in the touring car on debt , like she said she was writing to you ; it was Milt himself .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 36]: He started out in business when he was only fifteen years old , and this trip he was gettin ' up for his father and mother and Milla was the first vacation he ever took .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 30]: Well , of course she would n't like my tellin ' you , but I ca n't see the harm of it , now everything 's all over . ''
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 6]: `` All -- all over ?
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 13]: You mean Milla 's going to be -- to be married ? ''
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 9]: `` She already is , '' said Sadie .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 21]: `` They got married at her Aunt Jess and Uncle Purv 's house , up in Chicago , last Thursday .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 24]: Yes , sir ; that quiet little Milla 's a regular old married woman by this time , I expect , Ramsey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 33]: When he got over the shock , which was not until the next day , one predominating feeling remained : it was a gloomy pride -- a pride in his proven maturity .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 26]: He was old enough , it appeared , to have been the same thing as engaged to a person who was now a Married Woman .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 12]: His manner thenceforth showed an added trace of seriousness and self-consideration .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 30]: Having recovered his equipoise and something more , he entirely forgot that moment of humble admiration he had felt for Dora Yocum on the day of his flattest prostration .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 56]: When he saw her sitting in the classroom , smiling brightly up at the teacher , the morning of the school 's opening in the autumn , all his humility had long since vanished and she appeared to him not otherwise than as the scholar whose complete proficiency had always been so irksome to him .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 6]: `` Look at her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 5]: he muttered to himself .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 8]: `` Same ole Teacher 's Pet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 61]: Now and then , as the days and seasons passed , and Dora 's serene progress continued , never checked or even flawed , there stirred within some lingerings of the old determination to `` show '' her ; and he would conjure up a day-dream of Dora in loud lamentation , while he led the laughter of the spectators .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 14]: But gradually his feelings about her came to be merely a dull oppression .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 75]: He was tired of having to look at her -LRB- as he stated it -RRB- and he thanked the Lord that the time would n't be so long now until he 'd be out of that ole school , and then all he 'd have to do he 'd just take care never to walk by her house ; it was easy enough to use some other street when he had to go down-town .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 32]: `` The good ole class of Nineteen-Fourteen is about gone , '' he said to Fred Mitchell , who was still his most intimate friend when they reached the senior year .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 38]: `` Yes , sir ; it 's held together a good many years , Fred , but after June it 'll be busted plum up , and I hope nobody starts a move to have any reunions .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 31]: There 's a good many members of the ole class that I can stand and there 's some I ca n't , but there 's one I just wo n't !
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 31]: If we ever did call a reunion , that ole Yocum girl would start in right away and run the whole shebang , and that 's where I 'd resign !
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 23]: You know , Fred , the thing _ I _ think is the one biggest benefit of graduating from this ole school ?
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 10]: It 's never seein ' Dora Yocum again . ''
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 33]: This was again his theme as he sat by the same friend 's side , in the rear row of the class at Commencement , listening to the delivery of the Valedictory .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 12]: `` Thinks she 's just sooblime , do n't she ! ''
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 4]: he whispered morosely .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 15]: `` She would n't trade with the President of the United States right now .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 19]: She prob ` ly thinks bein ' Valedictorian is more important than Captain of the State University Eleven .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 4]: Never mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 8]: And here his tone became huskily jubilant .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 4]: `` Never mind !
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 19]: Just about a half-an-hour more and that 's the last o ' _ you _ , ole girl !
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 26]: Yes , sir , Fred ; one thing we can feel pretty good over : this is where we get through with Dora Yocum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 30]: Ramsey and Fred had arranged to room together at Greenfield , the seat of the state university , and they made the short journey in company the following September .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 77]: They arrived hilarious , anticipating pleasurable excitements in the way of `` fraternity '' pledgings and initiations , encounters with sophomores , class meetings , and elections ; and , also , they were not absolutely without interest in the matter of Girls , for the state university was co-educational , and it was but natural to expect in so broad a field , all new to them , a possible vision of something rather thrilling .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 65]: They whispered cheerfully of all these things during the process of matriculation , and signed the registrar 's book on a fresh page ; but when Fred had written his name under Ramsey 's , and blotted it , he took the liberty of turning over the leaf to examine some of the autographs of their future classmates , written on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 38]: Then he uttered an exclamation , more droll than dolorous , though it affected to be wholly the latter ; for the shock to Fred was by no means so painful as it was to his friend .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 13]: Ramsey leaned forward and read the name indicated by Fred 's forefinger .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 4]: _ Dora Yocum .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 65]: _ ... When they got back to their pleasant quarters at Mrs. Meig 's , facing the campus , Ramsey was still unable to talk of anything except the lamentable discovery ; nor were his companion 's burlesquing efforts to console him of great avail , though Fred did become serious enough to point out that a university was different from a high school .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 21]: `` It 's not like havin ' to use one big room as a headquarters , you know , Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 21]: Everything 's all split up , and she might happen not to be in a single of your classes . ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 9]: `` You do n't know my luck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 5]: the afflicted boy protested .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 17]: `` I wish I 'd gone to Harvard , the way my father wanted me to .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 12]: Why , this is just the worst nuisance I ever struck !
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 4]: You 'll see !
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 17]: She 'll be in everything there is , just the way she was back home . ''
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 25]: He appeared to be corroborated by the events of the next day , when they attended the first meeting to organize the new class .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 12]: The masculine element predominated , but Dora Yocum was elected vice-president .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 5]: `` You see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 3]: Ramsey said .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 7]: `` Did n't I tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 6]: You see what happens ? ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 28]: But after that she ceased for a time to intrude upon his life , and he admitted that his harassment was less grave than he had anticipated .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 51]: There were about five hundred students in the freshman class ; he seldom saw her , and when he did it was not more than a distant glimpse of her on one of the campus paths , her thoughtful head bent over a book as she hurried to a classroom .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 36]: This was bearable ; and in the flattering agitations of being sought , and even hunted , by several `` fraternities '' simultaneously desirous of his becoming a sworn Brother , he almost forgot her .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 67]: After a hazardous month the roommates fell into the arms of the last `` frat '' to seek them , and having undergone an evening of outrage which concluded with touching rhetoric and an oath taken at midnight , they proudly wore jewelled symbols on their breasts and were free to turn part of their attention to other affairs , especially the affairs of the Eleven .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 54]: However , they were instructed by the older brethren of their Order , whose duty it was to assist in the proper manoeuvring of their young careers , that , although support of the ` varsity teams was important , they must neglect neither the spiritual nor the intellectual by-products of undergraduate doings .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 16]: Therefore they became members of the college Y.M.C.A. and of the `` Lumen Society . ''
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 72]: According to the charter which it had granted itself , the `` Lumen Society '' was an `` Organization of male and female students '' -- so `` advanced '' was this university -- `` for the development of the powers of debate and oratory , intellectual and sociological progress , and the discussion of all matters relating to philosophy , metaphysics , literature , art , and current events . ''
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 36]: A statement so formidable was not without a hushing effect upon Messrs. Milholland and Mitchell ; they went to their first `` Lumen '' meeting in a state of fear and came away little reassured .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 41]: `` I could n't get up there , '' Ramsey declared , `` I could n't stand up there before all that crowd and make a speech , or debate in a debate , to save my soul and gizzard !
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 16]: Why , I 'd just keel right over and haf to be carried out . ''
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 22]: `` Well , the way I understand it , '' said Fred , `` we ca n't get out of it .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 28]: The seniors in the ` frat ' said we had to join , and they said we could n't resign , either , after we had joined .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 28]: They said we just had to go through it , and after a while we 'd get used to it and not mind it much . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 6]: _ I _ will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 3]: Ramsey insisted .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 36]: `` I could n't any more stand up there on my feet and get to spoutin ' about sociology and the radical metempsychorus of the metaphysical bazoozum than I could fly a flyin ' machine .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 17]: Why , I -- '' `` Oh , that was n't anything , '' Fred interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 30]: `` The only one that talked like that , he was that Blickens ; he 's a tutor , or something , and really a member of the faculty .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 29]: Most o ' the others just kind of blah-blahhed around , and what any of 'em tried to get off their chests hardly amounted to terribly much . ''
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 6]: `` I do n't care .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 9]: I could n't do it at _ all !
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 24]: _ '' `` Well , the way it looks to me , '' Fred observed , `` we simply _ got _ to !
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 15]: From what they tell me , the freshmen got to do more than anybody .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 14]: Every other Friday night , it 's all freshmen and nothin ' else .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 53]: You get a postal card on Monday morning in your mail , and it says ` Assignment ' on it , and then it 's got written underneath what you haf to do the next Friday night -- oration or debate , or maybe just read from some old book or something .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 16]: I guess we got to stand up there and _ try _ , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 8]: `` All right , '' said Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 21]: `` If they want me to commit suicide they can send me one o ' their ole ` Assignments . '
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 13]: I wo n't need to commit suicide , though , I guess .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 20]: All I 'll do , I 'll just fall over in a fit , and stay in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 33]: And , in truth , when he received his first `` Assignment , '' one Monday morning , a month later , he seemed in a fair way to fulfil his prophecy .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 22]: The attention of his roommate , who sat at a window of their study , was attracted by sounds of strangulation .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 11]: `` What on earth 's the matter , Ramsey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 3]: `` Look !
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 5]: Look at _ this !
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 29]: _ '' Fred took the card and examined it with an amazement gradually merging into a pleasure altogether too perceptible : ASSIGNMENT TWELVE-MINUTE DEBATE , CLASS OF 1918 .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 20]: _ Subject , Resolved : _ That Germany is both legally and morally justified in her invasion of Belgium .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 22]: -LRB- Debaters are notified that each will be held strictly to the following schedule : Affirmative , 4 min. , first .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 7]: Negative , 4 min. , first .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 7]: Affirm , 2 min. , second .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 8]: Neg. , 2 min. , second . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 44]: Affirmative Negative R. MILHOLLAND , '18 D. YOCUM , '18 Concluding his reading , which was oral , the volatile Mitchell made use of his voice in a manner of heathenish boisterousness , and presently reclined upon a lounge to laugh the better .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 15]: His stricken comrade , meanwhile , recovered so far as to pace the floor .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 15]: `` I 'm goin ' to pack up and light out for home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 7]: he declared , over and over .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 28]: And even oftener he read and reread the card to make sure of the actuality of that fatal coincidence , `` D. Yocum , ' 18 . ''
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 53]: Chapter XI `` If I _ could _ do it , '' he vociferated , `` if I _ could _ stand up there and debate one o ' their darn ole debates in the first place -- if I had the gall to even try it , why , my gosh !
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 23]: you do n't suppose I 'm goin ' to get up there and argue with _ that girl _ , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 26]: That 's a hot way to get an education : stand up there and argue with a girl before a couple o ' hundred people !
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 4]: My _ gosh !
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 8]: _ '' `` You got to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 7]: his prostrate companion cackled , weakly .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 9]: `` You ca n't get out of it .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 9]: You 're a goner , ole Buddy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 6]: `` I 'll be sick .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 8]: I 'll be sick as a dog !
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 19]: I 'll be sick as the sickest dog that ever -- '' `` No use , ole man .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 9]: The frat seniors 'll be on the job .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 26]: They 'll know whether you 're sick or not , and they 'll have you there , right on the spot to the minute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 5]: The prediction was accurate .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 18]: The too fatherly `` frat seniors '' did all that Fred said they would , and more .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 62]: For the honour of the `` frat , '' they coached the desperate Ramsey in the technic of Lumen debate , told him many more things to say than could be said in six minutes , and produced him , despairing , ghastly , and bedewed , in the large hall of the Lumen Society at eight o'clock on Friday evening .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 36]: Four other `` twelve-minute debates '' preceded his and the sound of these , in Ramsey 's ears , was the sound of Gabriel practising on his horn in the early morning of Judgment Day .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 45]: The members of the society sat , three rows deep , along the walls of the room , leaving a clear oblong of green carpet in the centre , where were two small desks , twenty feet apart , the rostrums of the debaters .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 35]: Upon a platform at the head of the room sat dreadful seniors , the officers of the society , and , upon benches near the platform , the debaters of the evening were aligned .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 27]: One of the fraternal seniors sat with sweltering Ramsey ; and the latter , as his time relentlessly came nearer , made a last miserable squirm .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 17]: `` Look here , Brother Colburn , I got to get out o ' here . ''
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 11]: `` No , you do n't , young fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 7]: `` Yes , I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 5]: Ramsey whispered , passionately .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 6]: `` Honest , I do .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 14]: Honest , Brother Colburn , I got to get a drink of water .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 7]: I _ got _ to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 5]: You ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 15]: `` Honest , Colburn , I _ got _ -- '' `` Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 15]: Ramsey grunted feebly , and cast his dilating eyes along the rows of faces .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 84]: Most of them were but as blurs , swimming , yet he was aware -LRB- he thought -RRB- of a formidable and horrible impassive scrutiny of himself , a glare seeming to pierce through him to the back of the belt round his waist , so that he began to have fearful doubts about that belt , about every fastening and adjustment of his garments , about the expression of his countenance , and about many other things jumbling together in his consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 25]: Over and over he whispered gaspingly to himself the opening words of the sentence with which Colburn had advised him to begin his argument .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 66]: And as the moment of supreme agony drew close , this whispering became continuous : `` In making my first appearance before this honor ` ble membership I feel constrained to say in making my first appearance before this honor ` ble membership I feel constrained to say in making my first appearance before this honor ` ble mem -- '' ... It had come .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 49]: The chairman announced the subject of the fourth freshman twelve-minute debate ; and Dora Yocum , hitherto unperceived by Ramsey , rose and went forward to one of the small desks in the open space , where she stood composedly , a slim , pretty figure in white .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 26]: Members in Ramsey 's neighbourhood were aware of a brief and hushed commotion , and of Colburn 's fierce whisper , `` You ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 6]: You get up there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 14]: And the blanched Ramsey came forth and placed himself at the other desk .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 50]: He stood before the silent populace of that morgue , and it seemed to him that his features had forgotten that he was supposed to be their owner and in control of them ; he felt that they were slipping all over his face , regardless of his wishes .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 79]: His head , as a whole , was subject to an agitation not before known by him ; it desired to move rustily in eccentric ways of its own devising ; his legs alternately limbered and straightened under no direction but their own ; and his hands clutched each other fiercely behind his back ; he was not one cohesive person , evidently , but an assembled collection of parts which had relapsed each into its own individuality .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 32]: In spite of them , he somehow contrived the semblance of a bow toward the chairman and the semblance of another toward Dora , of whom he was but hazily conscious .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 26]: Then he opened his mouth , and , not knowing how he had started his voice going , heard it as if from a distance .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 28]: `` In making my first appearance before this honor ` ble membership I feel restrained to say -- '' He stopped short , and thenceforward shook visibly .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 37]: After a long pause , he managed to repeat his opening , stopped again , swallowed many times , produced a handkerchief and wiped his face , an act of necessity -- then had an inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 28]: `` The subject assigned to me , '' he said , `` is resolved that Germany is mor ` ly and legally justified in Belgians -- Belgiums !
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 15]: This subject was assigned to me to be the subject of this debate . ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 22]: He interrupted himself to gasp piteously ; found breathing difficult , but faltered again : `` This subject is the subject .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 15]: It is the subject that was assigned to me on a postal card . ''
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 95]: Then , for a moment or so , he had a miraculous spurt of confidence , and continued rather rapidly : `` I feel constrained to say that the country of Belgian -- Belgium , I mean -- this country has been constrained by the -- invaded I mean -- invaded by the imperial German Impire and my subject in this debate is whether it ought to or not , my being the infernative -- affirmative , I mean -- that I got to prove that Germany is mor ` ly and legally justified .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 17]: I wish to state that -- '' He paused again , lengthily , then struggled on .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 81]: `` I have been requested to state that the German Imp -- Empire -- that it certainly is n't right for those Dutch -- Germans , I mean -- they have n't got any more business in Belgium than I have myself , but I -- I feel constrained to say that I had to accept whatever side of this debate I got on the postal card , and so I am constrained to take the side of the Dutch .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 5]: I mean the Germans .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 33]: The Dutch are sometimes called -- I mean the Germans are sometimes called the Dutch in this country , but they are n't Dutch , though sometimes called Dutch in this country .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 29]: Well , and so -- so , well , the war began last August or about then , anyway , and the German army invaded the Belgian army .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 9]: After they got there , the invasion began .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 12]: First , they came around there and then they commenced invading .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 30]: Well , what I feel constrained -- '' He came to the longest of all his pauses here , and the awful gravity of the audience almost suffocated him .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 17]: `` Well , '' he concluded , `` it do n't look right to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 5]: `` Four minutes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 24]: the chairman announced , for Ramsey 's pauses had worn away a great deal more of this terrible interval than had his eloquence .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 11]: `` Opening statement for the negative : Miss D. Yocum .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 4]: Four minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 57]: As Dora began to speak , Ramsey experienced a little relief , but only a little -- about the same amount of relief as that felt by a bridegroom when it is the bride 's turn to `` respond , '' not really relief at all , but merely the slight relaxation of a continuing strain .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 28]: The audience now looked at Ramsey no more than people look at a bridegroom , but he failed to perceive any substantial mitigation of his frightful conspicuousness .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 61]: He had not the remotest idea of what he had said in setting forth his case for Germany , and he knew that it was his duty to listen closely to Dora , in order to be able to refute her argument when his two-minute closing speech fell due but he was conscious of little more than his own condition .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 36]: His legs had now gone wild beyond all devilry , and he had to keep shifting his weight from one to the other in order even to hope that their frenzy might escape general attention .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 59]: He realized that Dora was speaking rapidly and confidently , and that somewhere in his ill-assembled parts lurked a familiar bit of him that objected to her even more than usual ; but she had used half of her time , at least , before he was able to gather any coherent meaning from what she was saying .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 35]: Even then he caught only a fragment , here and there , and for the rest -- so far as Ramsey was concerned -- she might as well have been reciting the Swedish alphabet .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 31]: In spite of the rather startling feebleness of her opponent 's statement , Dora went at her task as earnestly as if it were to confute some monster of casuistry .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 98]: `` Thus , having demonstrated that _ all _ war is wrong , '' she said , approaching her conclusion , `` it is scarcely necessary to point out that whatever the actual circumstances of the invasion , and whatever the status of the case in international law , or by reason of treaty , or the German oath to respect the neutrality of Belgium , which of course was grossly and dishonorably violated -- all this , I say , ladies and gentlemen of the Lumen Society , all this is beside the point of morals .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 28]: Since , as I have shown , _ all _ war is wrong , the case may be simplified as follows : All war is morally wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 6]: _ Quod erat demonstrandum _ .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 4]: Germany invaded Belgium .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 4]: Invasion is war .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 8]: Germany , therefore , did moral wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 22]: Upon the legal side , as I began by pointing out , Germany confessed in the Reichstag the violation of law .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 23]: Therefore , Germany was justified in the invasion neither morally nor legally ; but was both morally and legally wrong and evil .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 17]: Ladies and gentlemen of the Lumen Society , I await the refutation of my opponent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 25]: Her opponent appeared to be having enough trouble with his legs , without taking any added cares upon himself in the way of refutations .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 45]: But the marvellous Dora had calculated the length of her statement with such nicety that the chairman announced `` Four minutes , '' almost upon the instant of her final syllable ; and all faces turned once more to the upholder of the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 13]: `` Refutation and conclusion by the affirmative , '' said the chairman .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 5]: `` Mr. R. Milholland .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 4]: Two minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 74]: Therewith , Ramsey coughed as long as he could cough , and when he felt that no more should be done in this way , he wiped his face -- again an act of necessity -- and quaveringly began : `` Gentlemen and ladies , or ladies and gentlemen , in making the refutation of my opponent , I feel that -- I feel that hardly anything more ought to be said . ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 42]: He paused , looked helplessly at his uncontrollable legs , and resumed : `` I am supposed to make the reputa -- the refutation of my opponent , and I feel that I ought to say quite a good deal more .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 14]: In the first place , I feel that the invasion has taken place .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 19]: I am supposed -- anyhow I got a postal card that I am supposed to be here to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 32]: Well , in talking over this matter with a couple of seniors , they told me I was supposed to claim this invasion was mor ` ly and legally all right .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 30]: Well -- '' Here , by some chance , the recollection of a word of Dora 's flickered into his chaotic mind , and he had a brighter moment .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 18]: `` My opponent said she proved all war is wrong -- or something like that , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 14]: She said she proved it was wrong to fight , no matter what .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 26]: Well , if she was n't a girl , anybody that wanted to get her into a fight could prob ` ly do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 39]: He did not add that he would like to be the person to make the experiment -LRB- if Dora were n't a girl -RRB- , nor did the thought enter his mind until an hour or so later .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 19]: `` Well , '' he added , `` I suppose there is little more to be said . ''
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 45]: He was so right , in regard to his own performance , at least , that , thereupon drying up utterly , he proceeded to stand , a speechless figure in the midst of a multitudinous silence , for an eternity lasting forty-five seconds .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 17]: He made a racking effort , and at the end of this epoch found words again .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 20]: `` In making my argument in this debate , I would state that -- '' `` Two minutes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 4]: said the chairman .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 6]: `` Refutation by the negative .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 4]: Miss D. Yocum .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 4]: Two minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 11]: `` I waive them , '' said Dora , primly .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 16]: `` I submit that the affirmative has not refuted the argument of the negative . ''
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 5]: `` Very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 21]: With his gavel the chairman sharply tapped the desk before him , `` The question is now before the house .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 18]: ` Resolved , that Germany is both morally and legally justified in her invasion of Belgium . '
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 28]: All those in favour of the -- '' But here there was an interruption of a kind never before witnessed during any proceedings of the Lumen Society .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 28]: It came from neither of the debaters , who still remained standing at their desks until the vote settling their comparative merits in argument should be taken .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 30]: The interruption was from the rear row of seats along the wall , where sat new members of the society , freshmen not upon the program for the evening .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 29]: A loud voice was heard from this quarter , a loud but nasal voice , shrill as well as nasal , and full of a strange hot passion .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 5]: `` Mr. Chairman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 3]: it cried .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 6]: `` Look-a-here , Mr. Chairman !
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 9]: Mr. Chairman , I demand to be heard !
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 11]: You got ta gim me my say , Mr. Chairman !
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 9]: I 'm a-gunna have my _ say _ !
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 7]: You look-a-here , Mr. Chairman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 27]: Shocked by such a breach of order , and by the unseemly violence of the speaker , not only the chairman but everyone else looked there .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 64]: A short , strong figure was on its feet , gesticulating fiercely ; and the head belonging to it was a large one with too much curly black hair , a flat , swarthy face , shiny and not immaculately shaven ; there was an impression of ill-chosen clothes , too much fat red lip , too much tooth , too much eyeball .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 42]: Fred Mitchell , half-sorrowing , yet struggling to conceal tears of choked mirth over his roommate 's late exhibition , recognized this violent interrupter as one Linski , a fellow freshman who sat next to him in one of his classes .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 11]: `` What 's _ that _ cuss up to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 8]: Fred wondered , and so did others .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 4]: Linski showed them .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 37]: He pressed forward , shoving himself through the two rows in front of him till he emerged upon the green carpet of the open space , and as he came , he was cyclonic with words .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 17]: `` You do n't put no such stuff as this over , I tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 9]: he shouted in his hot , nasal voice .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 19]: `` This here 's a free country , and you call yourself a debating society , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 52]: Lem me tell you _ I _ belong to a debating society in Chicago , where I come from , and them fellas up there , they 'd think they 'd oughta be shot fer a fake like what you people are tryin ' to put over , here , to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 57]: I come down here to git some more education , and pay fer it , too , in good hard money I 've made sweatin ' in a machine shop up there in Chicago ; but if _ this _ is the kind of education I 'm a-gunna git , I better go on back there .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 11]: You call this a square debate , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 13]: He advanced toward the chairman 's platform , shaking a frantic fist .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 20]: `` Well , if you do , you got another think comin ' , my capitalis ' frien ' !
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 28]: you went and give out the question whether it 's right fer Choimuny to go through Belgium ; and what do you do fer the Choimun side ?
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 75]: You pick out this here big stiff '' -- he waved his passionate hand at the paralyzed Ramsey -- `` you pick out a boob like that for the Choimun side , a poor fish that gits stagefright so bad he do n't know whether he 's talkin ' or dead ; or else he fakes it ; because he 's a speaker so bum it looks more to me like he was faking .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 48]: You get this big stiff to fake the Choimun side , and then you go and stick up a goil agains ' him that 's got brains and makes a pacifis ' argument that wins the case agains ' the Choimuns like cuttin ' through hog lard !
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 12]: But you ai n't a-gunna git away with it , mister !
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 52]: Lem me tell you right here and now , I may be a mix blood , but I got some Choimun in me with the rest what I got , and before you vote on this here question you got ta hear a few woids from somebody that can _ talk !
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 43]: _ This whole war is a capitalis ' war , Belgium as much as Choimuny , and the United States is sellin ' its soul to the capitalis ' right now , I tell you , takin ' sides agains ' Choimuny .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 39]: Orders fer explosives and ammanition and guns and Red Cross supplies is comin ' into this country by the millions , and the capitalis ' United States is fat already on the blood of the workers of Europe !
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 31]: Yes , it is , and I 'll have my _ say , _ you boorjaw faker , and you can hammer your ole gavel to pieces at me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 27]: He had begun to shriek ; moisture fell from his brow and his mouth ; the scandalized society was on its feet , nervously into groups .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 8]: Evidently the meeting was about to disintegrate .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 10]: `` I 'll have my _ say _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 5]: the frenzied Linski screamed .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 39]: `` You try to put up this capitalis ' trick and work a fake to carry over this debate agains ' Choimuny , but you ca n't work it on _ me _ , lem me tell you !
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 7]: I 'll have my _ say !
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 54]: _ '' The outraged chairman was wholly at a loss how to deal with the `` unprecedented situation '' -- so he defined it , quite truthfully ; and he continued to pound upon the desk , while other clamours began to rival Linski 's ; shouts of `` Put him out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 4]: `` Order ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 7]: `` Shut up , Freshman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 9]: `` Turn him over to the sophomores ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 7]: `` This meeting is _ adjourned !
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 33]: _ '' bellowed the chairman , and there was a thronging toward the doors , while the frothing Linski asseverated : `` I 'm a-gunna git my say , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 6]: I 'll have my say !
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 7]: I 'll have my _ say !
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 14]: _ '' He had more than that , before the hour was over .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 47]: A moment after he emerged from the building and came out , still hot , upon the cool , dark campus , he found himself the centre of a group of his own classmates whom he at first mistook for sophomores , such was their manner .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 32]: ... As this group broke up , a few minutes later , a youth running to join it , scenting somewhat of interest , detained one of those who were departing .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 5]: `` What 's up ?
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 6]: What was that squealing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 5]: `` Oh , nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 7]: We just talked to that Linski .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 22]: Nobody else touched him , but Ramsey Milholland gave him a _ peach _ of a punch on the snoot . ''
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 4]: `` Whoopee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 11]: Ramsey was laconic in response to inquiries upon this subject .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 46]: When someone remarked : `` You served him right for calling you a boob and a poor fish and so on before all the society , girls and all , '' Ramsey only said : `` That was n't what I hit him for . ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 6]: He declined to explain further .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 57]: Chapter XII `` The way I look at it , Ramsey , '' Fred Mitchell said , when they reached their apartment , whither the benevolent Colburn accompanied them , `` the way I look at it , this Linski kind of paid you a compliment , after all , when he called you a fake .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 21]: He must have thought you anyway _ looked _ as if you could make a better speech than you did .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 5]: Oh , golly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 18]: And as Ramsey groaned , the jovial Mitchell gave himself up to the divan and the mirth .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 12]: `` Oh , oh , oh , _ golly _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 3]: he sputtered .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 13]: `` Never you mind , Brother Milholland , '' Colburn said gently .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 9]: `` The Lumen is used to nervous beginners .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 25]: I 've seen dozens in my time , just like you ; and some of 'em got to be first rate before they quit .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 19]: Besides , this crazy Linski is all that anybody 'll ever remember about to-night 's meeting , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 28]: There never was any such outbreak as that in _ my _ time , and I guess there never was in the whole history of the society .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 26]: We 'll probably suspend him until he apologizes to the society -- I 'm on the board , and I 'm in favour of it .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 7]: Who is the bird , anyhow ?
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 7]: He 's in your class . ''
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 32]: `` I never saw him before , '' Ramsey responded from the deep chair , where he had moodily thrown himself ; and , returning to his brooding upon his oratory .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 6]: `` Oh , murder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 3]: he moaned .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 19]: `` Well , '' said the senior , `` you 'll know him when you see him again .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 16]: You put your mark on him where you can see it , all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 3]: He chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 32]: `` I suppose I really ought to have interfered in that , but I decided to do a little astronomical observation , about fifty feet away , for a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 11]: I 'm ` way behind in my astronomy , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 10]: Do you know this Linski , Brother Mitchell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 19]: `` I 've talked to him a couple o ' times on the campus , '' said Fred .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 9]: `` He 's in one of my classes .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 20]: He 's about the oldest in our class , I guess -- a lot older than us , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 29]: He 's kind of an anarchist or something ; ca n't talk more 'n five minutes any time without gettin off some bug stuff about ` capitalism . '
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 22]: He said the course in political economy was all ` capitalism ' and the prof was bought by Wall Street . ''
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 7]: `` Poor old Prof. Craig ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 3]: Colburn laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 9]: `` He gets fifteen hundred a year . ''
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 48]: `` Yes ; I 'd heard that myself , and I told Linski , and he said he had an uncle workin ' in a steel mill got twice that much ; but it did n't make any difference , ole Craig was bought by Wall Street .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 39]: He said ` capitalism ' better look out ; he and the foreign-born workmen were goin ' to _ take _ this country some day , and that was one of the reasons he was after an education .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 45]: He talked pretty strong pro-German , too -- about the war in Europe -- but I sort of thought that was more because he 'd be pro-anything that he thought would help upset the United States than because he cared much about Germany . ''
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' said Colburn , `` that 's how he sounded to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 14]: I guess there 's plenty more like him in the cities , too .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 16]: That reminds me , I 'd better arrange a debate on immigration for the Lumen .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 13]: We 'll put Brother Milholland for the negative , this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 4]: Ramsey started violently .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 11]: `` See here -- '' But the senior reassured him .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 12]: `` Just wanted to see you jump , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 12]: `` Do n't fear ; you 've done your share . ''
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 8]: `` I should think I have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 3]: Ramsey groaned .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 13]: `` Yes , you wo n't be called on again this term .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 22]: By the way , '' said Colburn , thoughtfully , `` that was a clever girl you had against you to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 20]: I do n't believe in pacificism much , myself , but she used it very niftily for her argument .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 12]: Is n't she from your town , this Miss Yocum ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 3]: Fred nodded .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 18]: `` Well , she 's a clever young thing , '' said the senior , still thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 12]: And he added : `` Graceful girl , she is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 12]: At this , the roommates looked at him with startled attention .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 16]: Ramsey was so roused as to forget his troubles and sit forward in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 18]: `` Yes , '' said the musing Colburn , `` she 's a mighty pretty girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 17]: This exclamation was a simultaneous one ; the astounded pair stared at him in blank incredulity .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 10]: `` Why , do n't you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 4]: Colburn mildly inquired .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 10]: `` She seems to me very unusual looking . ''
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 11]: `` Well , yes , '' Fred assented , emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 8]: `` We 're with you there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 8]: `` Extraordinary eyes , '' continued Colburn .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 12]: `` Lovely figure , too ; altogether a strikingly pretty girl .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 8]: Handsome , I should say , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 12]: Yes , ` handsome ' rather than ` pretty ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 8]: He looked up from a brief reverie .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 8]: `` You fellows known her long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 5]: `` You bet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 3]: said Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 15]: `` She made a splendid impression on the Lumen , '' Colburn went on .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 18]: `` I do n't remember that I ever saw a first appearance there that quite equalled it .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 18]: She 'll probably have a brilliant career in the society , and in the university , too .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 11]: She must be a very fine sort of person . ''
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 50]: He deliberated within himself a few moments longer , then , realizing that his hosts and Brethren did not respond with any heartiness -- or with anything at all -- to the theme , he changed it , and asked them what they thought about the war in Europe .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 31]: They talked of the war rather drowsily for a while ; it was an interesting but not an exciting topic : the thing they spoke of was so far away .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 38]: It was in foreign countries where they had never been and had no acquaintances ; and both the cause and the issue seemed to be in confusion , though evidently Germany had `` started '' the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 32]: Only one thing emerged as absolutely clear and proved : there could be no disagreement about Germany 's `` dirty work , '' as Fred defined it , in violating Belgium .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 43]: And this stirred Ramsey to declare with justice that `` dirty work '' had likewise been done upon himself by the official person , whoever he or she was , who had given him the German side of the evening 's debate .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 17]: After this moment of fervour , the conversation languished , and Brother Colburn rose to go .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 26]: `` Well , I 'm glad you gave that Linski a fine little punch , Brother Milholland , '' he said , at the door .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 20]: `` It wo n't do you any harm in the ` frat , ' or with the Lumen either .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 9]: And do n't be discouraged about your debating .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 4]: You 'll learn .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 20]: Anybody might have got rattled by having to argue against as clever and good-looking a girl as that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 15]: The roommates gave each other a look of serious puzzlement as the door closed .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 15]: `` Well , Brother Colburn is a mighty nice fellow , '' Fred said .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 10]: `` He 's kind of funny , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 24]: Ramsey assented , and then , as the two prepared for bed , they entered into a further discussion of their senior friend .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 50]: They liked him `` all right , '' they said , but he certainly must be kind of queer , and they could n't just see how he had `` ever managed to get where he was '' in the `` frat '' and the Lumen and the university .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 24]: Chapter XIII Ramsey passed the slightly disfigured Linski on the campus next day without betraying any embarrassment or making a sign of recognition .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 35]: Fred Mitchell told his roommate , chuckling , that Linski had sworn to `` get '' him , and , not knowing Fred 's affiliations , had made him the confidant of his oath .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 21]: Fred had given his blessing , he said , upon the enterprise , and advised Linski to use a brick .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 24]: `` He 'll hit you on the head with it , '' said the light-hearted Fred , falling back upon this old joke .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 18]: `` Then you can catch it as it bounces off and throw it back at him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 29]: However , Linski proved to be merely an episode , not only so far as Ramsey was concerned but in the Lumen and in the university as well .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 56]: His suspension from the Lumen was for a year , and so cruel a punishment it proved for this born debater that he noisily declared he would found a debating society himself , and had a poster printed and distributed announcing the first meeting of `` The Free Speech and Masses ' Rights Council . ''
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 30]: Several town loafers attended the meeting , but the only person connected with the university who came was an oriental student , a Chinese youth of almost intrusive amiability .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 76]: Linski made a fiery address , the townsmen loudly appluading his advocacy of an embargo on munitions and the distribution of everybody 's `` property , '' but the Chinaman , accustomed to see students so madly in earnest only when they were burlesquing , took the whole affair to be intended humour , and tittered politely without cessation -- except at such times as he thought it proper to appear quite wrung with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 18]: Then he would rock himself , clasp his mouth with both hands and splutter through his fingers .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 13]: Linski accused him of being in the pay of `` capital . ''
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 42]: Next day the orator was unable to show himself upon the campus without causing demonstrations ; whenever he was seen a file of quickly gathering students marched behind him chanting repeatedly and deafeningly in chorus : `` Down with Wall Street !
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 4]: Hoch der Kaiser !
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 4]: Who loves Linski ?
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 6]: Who , who , who ?
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 3]: Hoo Lun !
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 4]: Who loves Linski ?
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 6]: Who , who , who ?
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 4]: Hoo Lun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 12]: Linski was disgusted , resigned from the university , and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 29]: `` Well , here it is n't mid-year Exams yet , and the good ole class of Nineteen-Eighteen 's already lost a member , '' said Fred Mitchell .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 10]: `` I guess we can bear the break-up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 9]: `` I guess so , '' Ramsey assented .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 13]: `` That Linski might just as well stayed here , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 9]: `` He could n't do any harm here .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 38]: He 'll prob ` ly get more people to listen to him in cities where there 's so many new immigrants and all such that do n't know anything , comin ' in all the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 9]: `` Oh , well , '' said Fred .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 12]: `` What do _ we _ care what happens to Chicago !
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 28]: Come on , let 's behave real wild , and go on over to the ` Teria and get us a couple egg sandwiches and sassprilly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 4]: Ramsey was willing .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 18]: After the strain of the `` mid-year Exams '' in February , they lived a free-hearted life .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 36]: They had settled into the ways of their world ; they had grown used to it , and it had grown used to them ; there was no longer any ignominy in being a freshman .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 16]: They romped upon the campus and sometimes rioted harmlessly about the streets of the town .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 46]: In the evenings they visited their fellows and Brethren and were visited in turn , and sometimes they looked so far ahead as to talk vaguely of their plans for professions or business -- though to a freshman this concerned an almost unthinkably distant prospect .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 21]: `` I guess I 'll go in with my father , in the wholesale drug business , '' said Fred .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 38]: `` My married brother already is in the firm , and I suppose they 'll give me a show -- send me out on the road a year or two first , maybe , to try me .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 13]: Then I 'm going to marry some little cutie and settle down .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 9]: What you goin ' to do , Ramsey ?
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 18]: Go to Law School , and then come back and go in your father 's office ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 4]: Guess so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 15]: It was always Fred who did most of the talking ; Ramsey was quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 57]: Fred told the `` frat seniors '' that Ramsey was `` developing a whole lot these days '' ; and he told Ramsey himself that he could see a `` big change '' in him , adding that the improvement was probably due to Ramsey 's having passed through `` terrible trials like that debate . ''
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 57]: Ramsey kept to their rooms more than his comrade did , one reason for this domesticity being that he `` had to study longer than Fred did , to keep up '' ; and another reason may have been a greater shyness than Fred possessed -- if , indeed , Fred possessed any shyness at all .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 51]: For Fred was a cheery spirit difficult to abash , and by the coming of spring knew all of the best-looking girl students in the place -- knew them well enough , it appeared , to speak of them not merely by their first names but by abbreviations of these .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 24]: He had become fashion 's sprig , a `` fusser '' and butterfly , and he reproached his roommate for shunning the ladies .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 54]: `` Well , the truth is , Fred , '' said Ramsey one day , responding darkly ; -- `` well , you see the truth is , Fred , I 've had a -- a -- I 've had an experience -- '' So , only , did he refer to Milla .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 42]: Fred said no more ; and it was comprehended between them that the past need never be definitely referred to again , but that it stood between Ramsey and any entertainment to be obtained of the gentler but less trustworthy sex .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 72]: And when other Brethren of the `` frat '' would have pressed Ramsey to join them in various frivolous enterprises concerning `` co-eds , '' or to be shared by `` co-eds , '' Fred thought it better to explain to them privately -LRB- all being sacred among Brethren -RRB- how Ramsey 's life , so far as Girls went , had been toyed with by one now a Married Woman .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 10]: This created a great deal of respect for Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 10]: It became understood everywhere that he was a woman-hater .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 54]: Chapter XIV That early spring of 1915 the two boys and their friends and Brethren talked more of the war than they had in the autumn , though the subject was not an all at absorbing one ; for the trenches in Flanders and France were still of the immense , remote distance .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 26]: By no stretch of imagination could these wet trenches be thought greatly to concern the `` frat , '' the Lumen , or the university .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 39]: Really important matters were the doings of the `` Track Team , '' now training in the `` Gym '' and on the ` Varsity Field , and , more vital still , the prospects of the Nine .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 14]: But in May there came a shock which changed things for a time .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 30]: The _ Lusitania _ brought to every American a revelation of what had lain so deep in his own heart that often he had not realized it was there .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 57]: When the Germans hid in the sea and sent down the great merchant ship , with American babies and their mothers , and gallantly dying American gentlemen , there came a change even to girls and boys and professors , until then so preoccupied with their own little aloof world thousands of miles from the murder .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 17]: Fred Mitchell , ever volatile and generous , was one of those who went quite wild .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 56]: No orator , he nevertheless made a frantic speech at the week 's `` frat meetings , '' cursing the Germans in the simple old English words that their performance had demonstrated to be applicable , and going on to demand that the fraternity prepare for its own share in the action of the country .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 49]: `` I do n't care _ how _ insignificant we few fellows here to-night may seem , '' he cried ; `` we can do our little , and if everybody in this country 's ready to do their own little , why , that 'll be plenty !
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 26]: Brothers , do n't you realize that all _ over _ the United States to-night the people are feeling just the way we are here ?
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 8]: Millions and millions and millions of them !
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 40]: Wherever there 's an American he 's _ with _ us -- and you bet your bottom dollar there are just a few more Americans in this country of ours than there are big-mouthed lobsters like that fellow Linski !
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 42]: I tell you , if Congress only gives the word , there could be an army of five million men in this country to-morrow , and those dirty baby-killin ' dachshunds would hear a word or two from your Uncle Samuel !
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 17]: Brothers , I demand that something be done right here and now , and by us !
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 30]: I move we telegraph the Secretary of War to-night and offer him a regiment from this university to go over and help _ hang _ their damn Kaiser . ''
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 9]: The motion was hotly seconded and instantly carried .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 53]: Then followed a much flustered discussion of the form and phrasing of the proposed telegram , but , after everything seemed to have been settled , someone ascertained by telephone that the telegraph company would not accept messages containing words customarily defined as profane ; so the telegram had to be rewritten .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 39]: This led to further amendment , and it was finally decided to address the senators from that state , instead of the Secretary of War , and thus in a somewhat modified form the message was finally despatched .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 73]: Next day , news of what the `` frat '' had done made a great stir in the university ; other `` frats '' sent telegrams , so did the `` Barbarians , '' haters of the `` frats '' but joining them in this ; while a small band of `` German-American '' students found it their duty to go before the faculty and report these `` breaches of neutrality . ''
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 55]: They protested heavily , demanding the expulsion of the `` breachers '' as disloyal citizens , therefore unfit students , but suffered a disappointment ; for the faculty itself had been sending telegrams of similar spirit , addressing not only the senators and congressmen of the state but the President of the United States .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 43]: Flabbergasted , the `` German-Americans '' retired ; they were confused and disgusted by this higher-up outbreak of unneutrality -- it overwhelmed them that citizens of the United States should not remain neutral in the dispute between the United States and Germany .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 8]: All day the campus was in ferment .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 30]: At twilight , Ramsey was walking meditatively on his way to dinner at the `` frat house , '' across the campus from his apartment at Mrs. Meig 's .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 22]: Everybody was quiet now , both town and gown ; the students were at their dinners and so were the burghers .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 20]: Ramsey was late but did not quicken his thoughtful steps , which were those of one lost in reverie .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 43]: He had forgotten that spring-time was all about him , and , with his head down , walked unregardful of the new gayeties flung forth upon the air by great clusters of flowering shrubs , just come into white blossom and lavender .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 26]: He was unconscious that somebody behind him , going the same way , came hastening to overtake him and called his name , `` Ramsey !
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 4]: Ramsey Milholland ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 24]: Not until he had been called three times did he realize that he was being hailed -- and in a girl 's voice !
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 19]: By that time , the girl herself was beside him , and Ramsey halted , quite taken aback .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 6]: The girl was Dora Yocum .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 16]: She was pale , a little breathless , and her eyes were bright and severe .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 14]: `` I want to speak to you , '' she said , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 9]: `` I want to ask you about something .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 39]: Mr. Colburn and Fred Mitchell are the only people I know in your ` frat ' except you , and I have n't seen either of them to-day , or I 'd have asked one of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 45]: Most uncomfortably astonished , Ramsey took his hands out of his pockets , picked a leaf from a lilac bush beside the path , and put the stem of the leaf seriously into a corner of his mouth , before finding anything to say .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 13]: `` Well -- well , all right , '' he finally responded .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 15]: `` I 'll tell you -- if it 's anything I know about . ''
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 10]: `` You know about it , '' said Dora .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 19]: `` That is , you certainly do if you were at your ` frat ' meeting last night .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 4]: Were you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 43]: `` Yes , I was there , '' Ramsey answered , wondering what in the world she wanted to know , though he supposed vaguely that it must be something about Colburn , whom he had several times seen walking with her .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 18]: `` Of course I could n't tell you much , '' he added , with an afterthought .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 25]: `` You see , a good deal that goes on at a ` frat ' meeting is n't supposed to be talked about . ''
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 18]: `` Yes , '' she said , smiling faintly , though with a satire that missed him .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 28]: `` I 've been a member of a sorority since September , and I think I have an idea of what could be told or not told .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 11]: Suppose we walk on , if you do n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 8]: My question need n't embarrass you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 13]: Nevertheless , as they slowly went on together , Ramsey was embarrassed .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 6]: He felt `` queer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 54]: They had known each other so long ; in a way had shared so much , sitting daily for years near each other and undergoing the same outward experiences ; they had almost `` grown up together , '' yet this was the first time they had ever talked together or walked together .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 7]: `` Well -- '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 28]: `` If you want to ask anything it 's all right for me to tell you -- well , I just as soon , I guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 22]: `` It has nothing to do with the secret proceedings of your ` frat ' , '' said Dora , primly .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 17]: `` What I want to ask about has been talked of all over the place to-day .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 31]: Everyone has been saying it was _ your _ ` frat ' that sent the first telegram to members of the Government offering support in case of war with Germany .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 18]: They say you did n't even wait until to-day , but sent off a message last night .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 16]: What I wanted to ask you was whether this story is true or not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 11]: `` Why , yes , '' said Ramsey , mildly .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 8]: `` That 's what we did . ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 14]: She uttered an exclamation , a sound of grief and of suspicion confirmed .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 7]: I was afraid so ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 5]: ` Afraid so ' ?
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 6]: What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 35]: he asked , and because she seemed excited and troubled , he found himself not quite so embarrassed as he had been at first ; for some reason her agitation made him feel easier .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 8]: `` What was wrong about that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 14]: `` Oh , it 's all so shocking and wicked and mistaken ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 19]: `` Even the faculty has been doing it , and half the other ` frats ' and sororities !
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 9]: And it was yours that started it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 13]: `` Yes , we did , '' he said , throughly puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 29]: `` We 're the oldest ` frat ' here , and of course '' -- he chuckled modestly -- `` of course we think we 're the best .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 19]: Do you mean you believe we ought to 've sat back and let somebody else start it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 8]: `` Oh , _ no _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 5]: she answered , vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 8]: `` Nobody ought to have started it !
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 10]: That 's the trouble ; do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 12]: If nobody had started it none of it might have happened .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 8]: The rest might n't have caught it .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 9]: It might n't have got into their heads .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 29]: A war thought is the most contagious thought in the world ; but if it can be kept from starting , it can be kept from being contagious .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 42]: It 's just when people have got into an emotional state , or a state of smouldering rage , that everybody ought to be so terribly careful not to think war thoughts or make war speeches -- or send war telegrams !
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 26]: I thought -- oh , I was so sure I 'd convinced Mr. Colburn of all this , the last time we talked of it !
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 15]: He seemed to understand , and I was sure he agreed with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 5]: She bit her lip .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 12]: `` He was only pretending -- I see that now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 18]: `` I guess he must ` a ' been , '' said Ramsey , with admirable simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 12]: `` He did n't talk about anything like that last night .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 10]: He was as much for it as anybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 7]: `` I 've no doubt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 30]: Ramsey made bold to look at her out of the side of his eye , and as she was gazing tensely forward he continued his observation for some time .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 38]: She was obviously controlling agitation , almost controlling tears , which seemed to threaten her very wide-open eyes ; for those now fully grown and noticeable eyewinkers of hers were subject to fluctuations indicating such a threat .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 23]: She looked `` hurt , '' and Ramsey was touched ; there was something human about her , then , after all .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 43]: And if he had put his feeling into words at the moment , he would have said that he guessed maybe he could stand this ole girl , for a few minutes sometimes , better than he 'd always thought he could .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 22]: `` Well , '' he said , `` Colburn prob ` ly would n't want to hurt your feelings or anything .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 6]: Colburn -- '' `` He ?
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 4]: He did n't !
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 13]: I have n't the faintest personal interest in what he did . ''
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 3]: said Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 32]: `` Well , excuse me ; I thought prob ` ly you were sore because he 'd jollied you about this pacifist stuff , and then -- '' `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 5]: she said , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 21]: `` I 'm not thinking of his having agreed with _ me _ and fooling _ me _ about it .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 21]: He just wanted to make a pleasant impression on a girl , and said anything he thought would please her .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 13]: I do n't care whether he does things like that or not .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 20]: What I care about is that the _ principle _ did n't reach him and that he mocked it !
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 25]: I do n't care about a petty treachery to me , personally , but I -- '' Fraternal loyalty could not quite brook this .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 17]: `` Brother Colburn is a perfectly honor ` ble man , '' said Ramsey , solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 20]: `` He is one of the most honor ` ble men in this -- '' `` Of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 22]: `` Oh , ca n't I make you understand that I 'm not condemning him for a little flattery to me ?
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 18]: I do n't care two straws for his showing that _ I _ did n't influence him .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 10]: He does n't interest me , please understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 5]: Ramsey was altogether perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 19]: `` Well , I do n't see what makes you go for him so hard , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 6]: `` I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 26]: `` But you said he was treach -- '' `` I do n't _ condemn _ him for it , '' she insisted , despairingly .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 8]: `` Do n't you see the difference ?
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 11]: I 'm not condemning anybody ; I 'm only lamenting .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 4]: `` What about ?
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 12]: `` About all of you that want _ war _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 5]: `` My golly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 3]: Ramsey exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 18]: `` You do n't think those Dutchmen were right to drown babies and -- '' `` No !
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 7]: I think they were ghastly murderers !
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 20]: I think they were detestable and fiendish and monstrous and -- '' `` Well , then , my goodness !
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 6]: What do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 8]: `` I do n't want war ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 6]: `` You do n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 6]: `` I want Christianity ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 37]: `` I ca n't think of the Germans without hating them , and so to-day , when all the world is hating them , I keep myself from thinking of them as much as I can .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 33]: Already half the world is full of war ; you want to go to war to make things right , but it wo n't ; it will only make more war ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 20]: `` Well , I -- '' `` Do n't you see what you 've done , you boys ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 14]: `` Do n't you see what you 've done with your absurd telegram ?
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 19]: That started the rest ; they thought they _ all _ had to send telegrams like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 26]: `` Well , the faculty -- '' `` Even they might n't have thought of it if it had n't been for the first one .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 29]: Vengeance is the most terrible thought ; once you put it into people 's minds that they ought to have it , it runs away with them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 15]: `` Well , it is n't mostly vengeance we 're after , at all .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 20]: There 's a lot more to it than just getting even with -- '' She did not heed him .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 6]: `` You 're all blind !
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 24]: You do n't see what you 're doing ; you do n't even see what you 've done to this peaceful place here .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 24]: You 've filled it full of thoughts of fury and killing and massacre -- '' `` Why , no , '' said Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 34]: `` It was those Dutch did that to us ; and , besides , there 's more to it than you -- '' `` No , there is n't , '' she interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 38]: `` It 's just the old brutal spirit that nations inherit from the time they were only tribes ; it 's the tribe spirit , and an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 17]: It 's those things and the love of fighting -- men have always loved to fight .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 22]: Civilization has n't taken it out of them ; men still have the brute in them that loves to fight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 11]: `` I do n't think so , '' said Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 21]: `` Americans do n't love to fight ; I do n't know about other countries , but we do n't .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 36]: Of course , here and there , there 's some fellow that likes to hunt around for scrapes , but I never saw more than three or four in my life that acted that way .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 20]: Of course a football team often has a scrapper or two on it , but that 's different . ''
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 7]: `` No , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 11]: `` I think you all really love to fight . ''
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 7]: Ramsey was roused to become argumentative .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 11]: `` I do n't see where you get the idea .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 23]: Colburn is n't that way , and back at school there was n't a single boy that was anything like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 10]: She stopped , and turned suddenly to face him .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 7]: he said , stopping , too .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 9]: Something he said had startled her , evidently .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 10]: `` How can you say such a thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 4]: she cried . ''
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 8]: _ You _ love to fight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 4]: `` Me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 4]: `` You do !
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 4]: You love fighting .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 7]: You always have loved fighting . ''
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 4]: He was dumbfounded .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 13]: `` Why , I never had a fight in my life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 9]: She cried out in protest of such prevarication .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 13]: `` Well , I never did , '' he insisted , mildly .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 13]: `` Why , you had a fight about _ me _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 8]: `` No , I did n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 6]: `` With Wesley Bender ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 4]: Ramsey chuckled . ''
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 9]: _ That _ was n't a fight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 6]: `` It was n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 5]: `` Nothing like one .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 39]: We were just guyin ' him about -- about gettin ' slicked up , kind of , because he at in front of you ; and he hit me with his book strap and I chased him off .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 13]: Gracious , no ; _ that _ was n't a fight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 10]: `` But you fought Linski only last fall . ''
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 4]: Ramsey chuckled again .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 16]: `` That was n't even as much like a fight as the one with Wesley .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 58]: I just told this Linski I was goin ' to give him a punch in the sn -- I just told him to look out because I was goin ' to hit him , and then I did it , and waited to see if he wanted to do anything about it , and he did n't .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 24]: That 's all there was to it , and it was n't any more like fighting than -- than feeding chickens is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 4]: She laughed dolefully .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 13]: `` It seems to me rather more like it than that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 8]: `` Well , it was n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 30]: They had begun to walk on again , and Ramsey was aware that they had passed the `` frat house , '' where his dinner was probably growing cold .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 12]: He was aware of this , but not sharply or insistently .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 10]: Curiously enough , he did not think about it .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 27]: He had begun to find something pleasant in the odd interview , and in walking beside a girl , even though the girl was Dora Yocum .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 13]: He made no attempt to account to himself for anything so peculiar .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 28]: For a while they went slowly together , not speaking , and without destination , though Ramsey vaguely took it for granted that Dora was going somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 5]: But she was n't .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 45]: They emerged from the part of the small town closely built about the university and came out upon a bit of parked land overlooking the river ; and here Dora 's steps slowed to an indeterminate halt near a bench beneath a maple tree .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 42]: `` I think I 'll stay here a while , '' she said ; and as he made no response , she asked , `` Had n't you better be going back to your ` frat house ' for your dinner ?
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 26]: I did n't mean for you to come out of your way with me ; I only wanted to get an answer to my question .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 8]: You 'd better be running back . ''
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 18]: `` Well -- '' He stood irresolute , not sure that he wanted his dinner just then .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 21]: It would have amazed him to face the fact deliberately that perhaps he preferred being with Dora Yocum to eating .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 15]: However , he faced no such fact , nor any fact , but lingered .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 8]: `` Well -- '' he said again .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 7]: `` You 'd better go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 13]: `` I guess I can get my dinner pretty near any time .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 10]: I do n't -- '' He had a thought .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 11]: `` Did you -- '' `` Did I what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 12]: `` Did you have your dinner before I met you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 13]: `` Well , are n't you -- '' She shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 8]: `` I do n't want any . ''
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 32]: `` I do n't think people have very much appetite to-day and yesterday , '' she said , with the hint of a sad laugh , `` all over America . ''
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 10]: `` No ; I guess that 's so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 7]: `` It 's too terrible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 46]: `` I ca n't sit and eat when I think of the _ Lusitania _ -- of all those poor , poor people strangling in the water -- '' `` No ; I guess nobody can eat much , if they think about that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 20]: `` And of what it 's going to bring , if we let it , '' she went on .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 18]: `` As if this killing were n't enough , we want to add _ our _ killing !
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 18]: Oh , that 's the most terrible thing of all -- the thing it makes within us !
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 6]: Do n't you understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 13]: She turned to him appealingly , and he felt queerer than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 4]: Dusk had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 58]: Where they stood , under the young-leaved maple tree , there was but a faint lingering of afterglow , and in this mystery her face glimmered wan and sweet ; so that Ramsey , just then , was like one who discovers an old pan , used in the kitchen , to be made of chased silver .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 17]: `` Well , I do n't feel much like dinner right now , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 17]: `` We -- we could sit here awhile on this bench , prob ` ly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 40]: Chapter XV Ramsey kept very few things from Fred Mitchell , and usually his confidences were immediate upon the occasion of them ; but allowed several weeks to elapse before sketching for his roommate the outlines of this adventure .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 29]: `` One thing that was kind o ' funny about it , Fred , '' he said , `` I did n't know what to call her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 59]: Mr. Mitchell , stretched upon the window seat in their `` study , '' and looking out over the town street below and the campus beyond the street , had already thought it tactful to ambush his profound amusement by turning upon his side , so that his face was toward the window and away from his companion .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 10]: `` What did you want to call her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 7]: he inquired in a serious voice .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 4]: `` Names ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 6]: You know what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 33]: I mean I had to just keep callin ' her ` you ' ; and that gets kind of freaky when you 're talkin ' to anybody a good while like that .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 43]: When she 'd be lookin ' away from me , and I 'd want to start sayin ' something to her , you know , why , I would n't know how to get started exactly , without callin ' her something .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 23]: A person does n't want to be always startin ' off with ` See here , ' or things like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 16]: `` I do n't see why you let it trouble you , '' said Fred .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 29]: `` From how you 've always talked about her , you had a perfectly handy way to start off with anything you wanted to say to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 5]: `` What with ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 17]: `` Why did n't you just say , ` Oh , you Teacher 's Pet ! '
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 8]: That would -- '' `` Get out !
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 31]: What I mean is , she called me ` Ramsey ' without any bother ; it seems funny I got stumped every time I started to say ` Dora . '
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 48]: Someway I could n't land it , and it certainly would ` a ' sounded crazy to call her ` Miss Yocum ' after sittin ' in the same room with her every day from the baby class clear on up through the end of high school .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 14]: That _ would _ ` a ' made me out an idiot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 8]: `` What did you call her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 3]: Fred asked .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 7]: `` Just nothin ' at all .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 21]: I started to call her something or other a hundred times , I guess , and then I 'd balk .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 25]: I 'd get all ready , and kind of make a sort of a sound , and then I 'd have to quit . ''
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 20]: `` She may have thought you had a cold , '' said Fred , still keeping his back turned .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 30]: `` I expect maybe she did -- though I do n't know ; most of the time she did n't seem to notice me much , kind of . ''
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 6]: `` She did n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 17]: She was too upset , I guess , by what she was thinkin ' about . ''
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 35]: `` But if it had n't been for that , '' Fred suggested , `` you mean she 'd have certainly paid more attention to who was sitting on the bench with her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 4]: `` Get out !
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 6]: You know how it was .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 26]: Everybody those few days thought we were goin ' to have war , and she was just sure of it , and it upset her .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 64]: Of course most people were a lot more upset by what those Dutchmen did to the _ Lusitania _ than by the idea of war ; and she seemed to feel as broken up as anybody could be about the _ Lusitania _ , but what got her the worst was the notion of her country wantin ' to fight , she said .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 19]: She really was upset , too , Fred ; there was n't any puttin ' on about it .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 38]: I guess that ole girl certainly must have a good deal of feeling , because , doggoned , after we 'd been sittin ' there a while if she did n't have to get out her handkerchief !
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 35]: She kept her face turned away from me -- just the same as you 're doin ' now to keep from laughin ' -- but honestly , she cried like somebody at a funeral .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 8]: I felt like the darndest fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 26]: `` I 'm not laughing , '' said Fred , but he did not prove it by turning so that his face could be seen .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 7]: `` What did she say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 12]: `` Oh , she did n't say such an awful lot .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 41]: She said one kind o ' funny thing though : she said she was sorry she could n't quite control herself , but if anybody had to see her cry she minded it less because it was an old schoolmate .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 30]: What struck me so kind o ' funny about that is -- why , it looks as if she never knew the way I always hated her so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Fred .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 7]: `` It was n't flattering ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 20]: `` Well , sir , it _ is n't _ , kind of , '' Ramsey agreed , musingly .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 14]: `` It certainly is n't when you look at it that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 11]: `` What did you say when she said that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 3]: Fred asked .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 4]: `` Nothin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 11]: I started to , but I sort of balked again .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 74]: Well , we kept on sitting there , and afterwhile she began to talk again and got kind of excited about how no war could do anything or anybody any good , and all war was wicked , no matter what it was about , and nothin ' could be good that was founded on fear and hate , and every war that ever was fought was always founded on fear and hate .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 25]: She said if the Germans wanted to fight us we ought to go to meet them and tell them we would n't fight . ''
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 7]: `` What did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 4]: `` Nothin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 13]: I kind o ' started to -- but what 's the use ?
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 8]: She 's got that in her head .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 21]: Besides , how are you goin ' to argue about a thing with a person that 's crying about it ?
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 31]: I tell you , Fred , I guess we got to admit , after all , that ole girl certainly must have a lost of heart about her , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 42]: There may not be much _ fun _ to her -- though of course I would n't know hardly any way to tell about that -- but there could n't be hardly any doubt she 's got a lot of feeling .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 37]: Well , and then she went on and said old men made wars , but did n't fight ; they left the fighting to the boys , and the suffering to the boy 's mothers . ''
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 15]: Fred exclaimed , and upon that he turned free of mirth for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 11]: `` That 's the woman of it , I guess .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 9]: Send the old men to do the fighting !
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 35]: For the matter of that , I guess my father 'd about a thousand times go himself than see me and my brothers go ; but Father 's so fat he ca n't stoop !
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 15]: You got to be able to stoop to dig a trench , I guess !
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 71]: Well , suppose we sent our old men up against those Dutchmen ; the Dutchmen would just kill the old men , and then come after the boys anyway , and the boys would n't be ready , and they 'd get killed , too ; and then there would n't be anybody but the Dutchmen left , and that 'd be one fine world , would n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 8]: `` Course I thought of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 7]: `` Did you tell her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 7]: `` What did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 4]: `` Nothin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 16]: I could n't get started anyway , but , besides , what was the use ?
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 20]: But she did n't want the old men to go ; she did n't want anybody to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 11]: `` What did she want the country to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 5]: Fred asked , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 12]: `` Just what it has been doin ' , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 21]: Just let things simmer down , and poke along , and let them do what they like to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 6]: `` I guess so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 3]: said Fred .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 40]: `` Then , afterwhile , when they get some free time on their hands , they 'll come over and make it _ really _ interesting for us , because they know we wo n't do anything but talk .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 15]: Yes , I guess the way things are settling down ought to suit Dora .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 11]: There is n't goin ' to be any war . ''
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 16]: `` She was pretty sure there was , though , '' Ramsey said , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 9]: `` Oh , of course she was then .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 9]: We all thought so those few days . ''
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 24]: She said she thought it prob ` ly would n't come right away , but now it was almost sure to come sometime .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 40]: She said our telegrams and all the talk and so much feeling and everything showed her that the war thought that was always _ in _ people somewhere had been stirred up so it would go on and on .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 34]: She said she knew from the way she felt herself about the _ Lusitania _ that a feeling like that in her would never be absolutely wiped out as long as she lived .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 80]: But she said her other feeling about the horribleness of war taught her to keep the first feeling from breaking out , but with other people it would n't ; and even if war did n't break out right then , it would always be ready to , all over the country , and sometime it would , though she was goin ' to do her share to fight it , herself , as long as she could stand .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 16]: She asked me would n't I be one of the ones to help her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 13]: He paused , and after a moment Fred asked , `` Well ?
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 8]: What did you say to that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 4]: `` Nothin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 29]: I started to , but -- '' Again Fred thought it tactful to turn and look out the window , while the agitation of his shoulders betrayed him .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 6]: `` Go on and laugh !
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 30]: Well , so we stayed there quite a while , but before we left she got kind of more like everyday , you know , the way people do .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 125]: It was half-past nine when we walked back in town , and I was commencin ' to feel kind of hungry , so I asked her if she was n't , and she sort of laughed and seemed to be ashamed of it , as if it were a disgrace or something , but she said she guessed she was ; so I left her by that hedge of lilacs near the observatory and went on over to the ` Teria and the fruit store , and got some stuffed eggs and olives and half-a-dozen peanut butter sandwiches and a box o ' strawberries -- kind of girl-food , you know -- and went on back there , and we ate the stuff up .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 47]: So then she said she was afraid she 'd taken me away from my dinner and made me a lot of trouble , and so on , and she was sorry , and she told me good-night -- '' `` What did you say then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 8]: `` Noth -- Oh , shut up !
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 16]: So then she skipped out to her Dorm , and I came on home . ''
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 11]: `` When did you see her next , Ramsey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 12]: `` I have n't seen her next , '' said Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 14]: `` I have n't seen her at all -- not to speak to .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 71]: I saw her on Main Street twice since then , but both times she was with some other girls , and they were across the street , and I could n't tell if she was lookin ' at me -- I kind of thought not -- so I thought it might look sort o ' nutty to bow to her if she was n't , so I did n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 29]: `` And you did n't tell her you would n't be one of the ones to help her with her pacifism and anti-war stuff and all that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 10]: I started to , but -- Shut up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 6]: Fred sat up , giggling .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 11]: `` So she thinks you _ will _ help her .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 18]: You did n't say anything at all , and she must think that means she converted you .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 8]: Why did n't you speak up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 16]: `` Well , _ I _ would n't argue with her , '' said Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 16]: Then , after a silence , he seemed to be in need of sympathetic comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 17]: `` It _ was _ kind o ' funny , though , was n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 5]: he said , appealingly .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 5]: `` What was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 6]: `` The whole business . ''
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 14]: `` What ` whole bus ' -- '' `` Oh , get out !
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 40]: Her stoppin ' me , and me goin ' pokin ' along with her , and her -- well , her crying and everything , and me being around with her while she felt so upset , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 16]: It seems -- well , it does seem kind o ' funny to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 6]: `` Why does it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 7]: Fred inquired , preserving his gravity .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 10]: `` Why should it seem funny to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 19]: `` I do n't mean funny like something 's funny you laugh at , '' Ramsey explained laboriously .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 23]: `` I mean funny like something that 's out of the way , and you wonder how it ever happened to happen .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 45]: I mean it seems funny I 'd ever be sittin ' there on a bench with that ole girl I never spoke to in my life or had anything to do with , and talkin ' about the United States goin ' to war .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 20]: What we were talkin ' about , why , that seems just as funny as the rest of it .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 48]: Lookin ' back to our class picnic , f ' r instance , second year of high school , that day I jumped in the creek after -- Well , you know , it was when I started makin ' a fool of myself over a girl .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 42]: Thank goodness , I got _ that _ out o ' my system ; it makes me just sick to look back on those days and think of the fool things I did , and all I thought about that girl .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 55]: Why , she -- Well , I 've got old enough to see now she was just about as ordinary a girl as there ever was , and if I saw her now I would n't even think she was pretty ; I 'd prob ` ly think she was sort of loud-lookin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 17]: Well , what 's passed is past , and it is n't either here nor there .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 58]: What I started to say was this : that the way it begins to look to me , it looks as if nobody can tell in this life a darn thing about what 's goin ' to happen , and the things that do happen are the very ones you 'd swear were the last that could .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 15]: I mean -- you look back to that day of the picnic -- my !
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 88]: but I was a rube then -- well , I mean you look back to that day , and what do you suppose I 'd have thought then if somebody 'd told me the time would ever come when I 'd be ` way off here at college sittin ' on a bench with Dora Yocum -- with _ Dora Yocum _ , in the first place -- and her crying , and both of us talking about the United States goin ' to war with Germany !
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 14]: Do n't it seem pretty funny to you , Fred , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 22]: `` But as near as I can make out , '' Fred said , `` that is n't what happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 7]: `` Why is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 13]: `` You say ` and both us talking ' and so on .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 19]: As near as I can make out , _ you _ did n't say anything at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 23]: `` Well , I did n't -- much , '' Ramsey admitted , and returned to his point with almost pathetic persistence .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 16]: `` But does n't it seem kind o ' funny to you , Fred ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 9]: `` Well , I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 10]: `` It does to me , '' Ramsey insisted .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 8]: `` It certainly does to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' said Fred cruelly .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 24]: `` I 've noticed you said so , but it do n't look any funnier than you do when you say it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 9]: Suddenly he sent forth a startling shout . ''
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 3]: _ Wow !
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 11]: _ You 're as red as a blushing beet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 6]: `` I am not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 5]: `` Y' are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 3]: shouted Fred .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 3]: `` Wow !
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 8]: The ole woman-hater 's got the flushes !
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 9]: Oh , look at the pretty posy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 21]: And , jumping down from the window seat , he began to dance round his much perturbed comrade , bellowing .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 46]: Ramsey bore with him for a moment , then sprang upon him ; they wrestled vigorously , broke a chair , and went to the floor with a crash that gave the chandelier in Mrs. Meig 's parlour , below , an attack of jingles .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 7]: `` You let me up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 3]: Fred gasped .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 10]: `` You take your solemn oath to shut up ?
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 8]: You goin ' to swear it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 4]: `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 19]: I give my solemn oath , '' said Fred ; and they rose , arranging their tousled attire .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 18]: `` Well , '' said Fred , `` when you goin ' to call on her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 6]: `` You look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 5]: Ramsey approached him dangerously .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 14]: `` You just gave me your sol -- '' `` I beg ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 5]: Fred cried , retreating .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 36]: `` I mean , aside from all that , why , I just thought maybe after such an evening you 'd feel as a gentleman you ought to go and ask about her health . ''
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 41]: `` Now , see here -- '' `` No , I mean it ; you ought to , '' Fred insisted , earnestly , and as his roommate glared at him with complete suspicion , he added , in explanation .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 34]: `` You ought to go next Caller 's Night , and send in your card , and say you felt you ought to ask if she 'd suffered any from the night air .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 29]: Even if you could n't manage to say that , you ought to start to say it , anyhow , because you -- Keep off o ' me !
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 17]: I 'm only tryin ' to do you a good turn , ai n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 18]: `` You save your good turns for yourself , '' Ramsey growled , still advancing upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 27]: But the insidious Mitchell , evading him , fled to the other end of the room , picked up his cap , and changed his manner .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 27]: `` Come on , ole bag o ' beans , let 's be on our way to the ` frat house ' ; it 's time .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 8]: We 'll call this all off . ''
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 5]: `` You better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 10]: Ramsey warned him ; and they trotted out together .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 41]: But as they went along , Fred took Ramsey 's arm confidentially , and said , `` Now , honestly , Ram , ole man , when _ are _ you goin ' to -- '' Ramsey was still red .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 5]: `` You look here !
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 18]: Just say one more word -- '' `` Oh , _ no _ , '' Fred expostulated .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 9]: `` I mean _ seriously _ , Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 6]: Honestly , I mean seriously .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 16]: Are n't you seriously goin ' to call on her some Caller 's Night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 8]: `` No , I 'm not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 6]: `` But why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 9]: `` Because I do n't want to . ''
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 45]: `` Well , seriously , Ramsey , there 's only one Caller 's Night before vacation , and so I suppose it hardly will be worth while ; but I expect you 'll see quite a little of her at home this summer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 7]: `` No , I wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 8]: I wo n't see her at all .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 24]: She is n't goin ' to be home this summer , and I would n't see anything of her if she was . ''
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 10]: `` Where 's she goin ' to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 5]: `` In Chicago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 5]: `` She is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 5]: said Fred , slyly .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 8]: `` When 'd she tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 5]: Ramsey turned on him .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 5]: `` You look out !
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 6]: She did n't tell me .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 27]: I just happened to see in the _ Bulletin _ she 's signed up with some other girls to go and do settlement work in Chicago .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 5]: Anybody could see it .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 6]: It was printed out plain .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 22]: You could have seen it just as well as I could , if you 'd read the _ Bulletin _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 7]: `` Oh , '' said Fred .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 10]: `` Now look here -- '' `` Good heavens !
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 10]: Ca n't I even say ` oh ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 11]: `` It depends on the way you say it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 13]: `` I 'll be careful , '' Fred assured him , earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 18]: `` I really and honestly do n't mean to get you excited about all this , Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 18]: I can see myself you have n't changed from your old opinion of Dora Yocum a bit .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 40]: I was only tryin ' to get a little rise out of you for a minute , because of course , seriously , why , I can see you hate her just the same as you always did . ''
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 16]: `` Yes , '' said Ramsey , disarmed and guileless in the face of diplomacy .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 28]: `` I only told you about all this , Fred , because it seemed -- well , it seemed so kind o ' funny to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 6]: Fred affected not to hear .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 9]: `` What did you say , Ramsey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 5]: Ramsey looked vaguely disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 42]: `` I said -- why , I said it all seemed kind o ' -- '' He paused , then repeated plaintively : `` Well , to me , it all seemed kind o ' -- kind o ' funny . ''
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 5]: `` What did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 36]: Fred inquired , but as he glanced in seeming naivete at his companion , something he saw in the latter 's eye warned him , and suddenly Fred thought it would be better to run .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 13]: Ramsey chased him all the way to the `` frat house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 45]: Chapter XVI Ramsey was not quite athlete enough for any of the ` varsity teams ; neither was he an antagonist safely encountered , whether in play or in earnest , and during the next few days he taught Fred Mitchell to be cautious .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 30]: The chaffer learned that his own agility could not save him from Ramsey , and so found it wiser to contain an effervescence which sometimes threatened to burst him .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 18]: Ramsey as a victim was a continuous temptation , he was so good-natured and yet so furious .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 41]: After Commencement , when the roommates had gone home , Mr. Mitchell 's caution extended over the long sunshiny months of summer vacation ; he broke it but once and then in well-advised safety , for the occasion was semi-public .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 59]: The two were out for a stroll on a July Sunday afternoon ; and up and down the street young couples lolled along , young families and baby carriages straggled to and from the houses of older relatives , and the rest of the world of that growing city was rocking and fanning itself on its front veranda .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 14]: `` Here 's a right pretty place , is n't it , Ramsey ?
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 6]: do n't you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 31]: Fred remarked innocently , as they were passing a lawn of short-clipped , bright green grass before a genial-looking house , fresh in white paint and cool in green-and-white awnings .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 35]: A broad veranda , well populated just now , crossed the front of the house ; fine trees helped the awnings to give comfort against the sun ; and Fred 's remark was warranted .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 22]: Nevertheless , he fell under the suspicion of his companion , who had begun to evince some nervousness before Fred spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 8]: `` What place do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 10]: `` The Yocum place , '' said Mr. Mitchell .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 12]: `` I hear the old gentleman 's mighty prosperous these days .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 15]: They keep things up to the mark , do n't they , Ramsey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 19]: `` I do n't know whether they do or whether they do n't , '' Ramsey returned shortly .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 6]: Fred appeared to muse regretfully .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 40]: `` It looks kind of _ empty _ now , though , '' he said , `` with only Mr. and Mrs. Yocum and their three married daughters , and eight or nine children on the front porch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 15]: `` You wait till I get you where they ca n't see us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 6]: Ramsey warned him , fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 8]: `` You ca n't do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 6]: said Fred , manifesting triumph .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 25]: `` We 'll both stop right here in plain sight of the whole Yocum family connection till you promise not to touch me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 14]: And he halted , leaning back implacably against the Yocum 's iron fence .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 4]: Ramsey was scandalized .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 5]: `` Come on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 5]: he said , hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 9]: `` Do n't stop _ here _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 16]: `` I will , and if you go on alone I 'll yell at you .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 21]: You got to stand right here with all of 'em lookin ' at you until -- '' `` I promise !
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 9]: My heavens , come _ on _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 30]: Fred consented to end the moment of agony ; and for the rest of the summer found it impossible to persuade Ramsey to pass that house in his company .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 8]: `` I wo n't do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 4]: Ramsey told him .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 50]: `` Your word of honour means nothin ' to me ; you 're liable to do anything that comes into your head , and I 'm gettin ' old enough to not get a reputation for bein ' seen with people that act the idiot on the public streets .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 27]: No , sir ; we 'll walk around the block -- at least , we will if you 're goin ' with _ me _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 17]: And to Fred 's delight , though he concealed it , they would make this detour .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 47]: The evening after their return to the university both were busy with their trunks and various orderings and disorderings of their apartment , but Fred several times expressed surprise that his roommate should be content to remain at home ; and finally Ramsey comprehended the implications .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 17]: Mrs. Meigs 's chandelier immediately jingled with the shock of another crash upon the floor above .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 7]: `` You let me up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 28]: Fred commanded thickly , his voice muffled by the pile of flannels , sweaters , underwear , and raincoats wherein his head was being forced to burrow .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 9]: `` You let me up , darn you !
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 9]: _ I _ did n't say anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 12]: And upon his release he complained that the attack was unprovoked .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 33]: `` I did n't say anything on earth to even hint you might want to go out and look around to see if anybody in particular had got back to college yet .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 19]: I did n't even mention the _ name _ of Dora Yo -- Keep off o ' me !
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 9]: My goodness , but you are sensitive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 35]: As a matter of fact , neither of them saw Dora until the first meeting of the Lumen , whither they went as sophomores to take their pleasure in the agony of freshmen debaters .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 28]: Ramsey was now able to attend the Lumen , not with complacence but at least without shuddering over the recollection of his own spectacular first appearance there .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 32]: He had made subsequent appearances , far from brilliant yet not disgraceful , and as a spectator , at least , he usually felt rather at his ease in the place .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 37]: It can not be asserted , however , that he appeared entirely at his ease this evening after he had read the `` Programme '' chalked upon the large easel blackboard beside the chairman 's desk .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 31]: Three `` Freshmen Debates '' were announced , and a `` Sophomore Oration , '' this last being followed by the name , `` D. Yocum , ' 18 . ''
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 24]: Ramsey made immediate and conspicuous efforts to avoid sitting next to his roommate , but was not so adroit as to be successful .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 23]: However , Fred was merciful : the fluctuations of his friend 's complexion were an inspiration more to pity than to badinage .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 71]: The three debates all concerned the `` Causes of the War in Europe , '' and honours appeared to rest with a small and stout , stolidly `` pro-German '' girl debater , who had brought with her and translated at sight absa-loot proofs -LRB- so she called them -RRB- , printed in German , that Germany had been attacked by Belgium at the low instigation of the envious English .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 33]: Everybody knew it was n't true ; but she made an impression and established herself as a debater , especially as her opponent was quite confounded by her introduction of printed matter .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 70]: When the debates and the verdicts were concluded , the orator appeared , and Fred 's compassion extended itself so far that he even refrained from looking inquisitively at the boy in the seat next to his ; but he made one side wager , mentally -- that if Ramsey had consented to be thoroughly confidential just then , he would have confessed to feeling kind o ' funny .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 25]: Dora was charmingly dressed , and she was pale ; but those notable eyelashes of hers were all the more notable against her pallor .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 30]: And as she spoke with fire , it was natural that her colour should come back quite flamingly and that her eyes should flash in shelter of the lashes .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 61]: `` The Christian Spirit and Internationalism '' was her subject , yet she showed no meek sample of a Christian Spirit herself when she came to attacking war-makers generally , as well as all those `` half-developed tribesmen , '' and `` victims of herd instinct '' who believed that war might ever be justified under any circumstances of atrocity .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 21]: She was eloquent truly , and a picture of grace and girlish dignity , even when she was most vigorous .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 12]: Nothing could have been more militant than her denunciation of militancy .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 24]: `` She 's an actual wonder , '' Fred said , when the two had got back to Mrs. Meigs 's , afterward .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 30]: `` Do n't you look at me like that : I 'm talkin ' about her as a public character , and there 's nothin ' personal about it .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 6]: You let me alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 9]: Ramsey was not clear as to his duty .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 52]: `` Well -- '' `` If any person makes a public speech , '' Fred protested , `` I got a perfect right to discuss 'em , no matter what you think of 'em '' -- and he added hastily -- `` or _ do n't _ think of 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 10]: `` Look here -- '' `` Good heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 3]: Fred exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 27]: `` You are n't expecting to interfere with me if I say anything about that little fat Werder girl that argued for Germany , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 7]: Or any of the other speakers ?
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 17]: I got a right to talk about 'em just as public speakers , have n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 19]: Well , what I say is : Dora Yocum as an orator is just an actual perfect wonder .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 5]: Got any objections ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 4]: `` N-no . ''
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 6]: `` All right then . ''
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 69]: Fred settled himself upon the window seat with a pipe , and proceeded , `` There 's something about her , when she stands there , she stands so straight and knows just what she 's up to , and everything , why , there 's something about her makes the cold chills go down your spine -- I mean _ my _ spine , not yours particularly !
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 16]: You sit down -- I mean _ anybody 's _ spine , doggone it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 30]: And as Ramsey increased the manifestations of his suspicions , lifting a tennis racket over the prostrate figure , `` Oh , murder , '' Fred said , resignedly .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 10]: `` All right , we 'll change the subject .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 19]: That fat little Werder cutie made out a pretty good case for Germany , did n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 23]: Ramsey tossed the racket away , disposed himself in an easy chair with his feet upon the table , and presently chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 21]: `` You remember the time I had the fuss with Wesley Bender , back in the ole school days ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 4]: `` Yep . ''
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 22]: `` All the flubdub this Werder girl got off to-night puts me in mind of the way I talked that day .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 9]: I can remember it as well as anything !
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 98]: Wesley kept yelpin ' that whoever mentioned a lady 's name in a public place was a pup , and of course I did n't want to hit him for that ; a boy 's got a reg ` lar instinct for tryin ' to make out he 's on the right side in a scrap , and he 'll always try to do something , or say something , or he 'll get the other boy to say someting to make it look as if the other boy was in the wrong and began the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 35]: So I told poor ole Wes that my father spoke my mother 's name in a public place whenever he wanted to , and I dared him to say my father was a pup .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 5]: And all so on .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 29]: A boy startin ' up a scrap , why , half the time he 'll drag his father and mother if there 's any chance to do it .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 36]: He 'll fix up some way so he can say , ` Well , that 's just the same as if you called my father and mother a fool , ' or something like that .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 33]: Then , afterward , he can claim he was scrappin ' because he had to defend his father and mother , and of course he 'll more than half believe it himself .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 86]: `` Well , you take a Government -- it 's only just some _ men _ , the way I see it , and if they 're goin ' to start some big trouble like this war , why , of course they 'll play just about the same ole boy trick , because it 's instinct to do it , just the same for a man as it is for a boy -- or else the principle 's just the same , or something .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 65]: Well , anyhow , if you want to know who started a scrap and worked it up , you got to forget all the _ talk _ there is about it , and all what each side _ says _ , and just look at two things : Who was fixed for it first , or thought they were , and who hit first ?
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 21]: When you get the answer to those two questions everything 's settled about all this being ` attacked ' business .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 52]: Both sides , just the same as boys , they 'll both claim they _ had _ to fight ; but if you want to know which one _ did _ have to , why forget all the arguing and do n't take your eye off just what _ happened _ .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 40]: As near as I can make out , this war began with Germany and Austria startin ' in to wipe out two little countries ; Austria began shootin ' up Serbia , and Germany began shootin ' up Belgium .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 42]: I do n't need to notice any more than that , myself -- all the Werder girls in the country can debate their heads off , they ca n't change what happened and they ca n't excuse it , either . ''
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 75]: He was silent , appearing to feel that he had concluded conclusively , and the young gentleman on the window seat , after staring at him for several moments of genuine thoughtfulness , was gracious enough to observe , `` Well , ole Ram , you may be a little slow in class , but when you think things out with yourself you do show signs of something pretty near like real horse-sense sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 19]: Why do n't you ever say anything like that to -- to some of your pacifist friends ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 6]: `` What do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 6]: Who you talkin ' about ?
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 7]: Whose ` pacifist friends ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 5]: `` See here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 10]: Fred exclaimed , as Ramsey seemed about to rise .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 33]: `` You keep sitting just where you are , and do n't look at me out of the side of your eye like that -- pretendin ' you 're a bad horse .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 14]: I 'm _ really _ serious now , and you listen to me .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 17]: I do n't think argufying and debating like that little Fraulein Werder 's does much harm .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 22]: She 's a right nifty young rolypoly , by the way , though you did n't notice , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 7]: `` Why did n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 5]: Ramsey demanded , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 8]: `` Why did n't I notice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 5]: `` Oh , nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 37]: But , as I was saying , I do n't think that sort of talk does much harm : everybody knows it goes on among the pro-Germans , and it 's all hot air , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 38]: But I think Linski 's sort of talk does do harm , prob ` ly among people that do n't know much ; and what 's more , I think Dora Yocum 's does some , too .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 17]: Well , you hit Linski in the snoot , so what are you -- Sit still !
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 3]: My lord !
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 18]: You do n't think I 'm askin ' you to go and hit Dora , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 23]: I mean : Are n't you ever goin ' to talk to her about it and tell her what 's what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 10]: `` Oh , you go on to bed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 12]: `` No , I 'm in earnest , '' Fred urged .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 12]: `` Honestly , are n't you ever goin ' to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 10]: `` How could I do anything like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 4]: Ramsey demanded explosively .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 13]: `` I never see her -- to speak to , that is .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 26]: I prob ` ly wo n't happen to have another talk with her , or anything , all the time we 're in college . ''
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 12]: `` No , '' Fred admitted , `` I suppose not .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 30]: Of course , if you did , then you would give her quite a talking-to , just the way you did the other time , would n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 16]: But upon that , another resumption of physical violence put an end to the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 48]: Chapter XVII Throughout the term Ramsey 's calculation of probabilities against the happening of another interview with Dora seemed to be well founded , but at the beginning of the second `` semester '' he found her to be a fellow member of a class in biology .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 28]: More than that , this class had every week a two-hour session in the botanical laboratory , where the structure of plants was studied under microscopic dissection .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 35]: The students worked in pairs , a special family of plants being assigned to each couple ; and the instructor selected the couples with an eye to combinations of the quick with the slow .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 30]: D. Yocum and R. Milholland -LRB- the latter in a strange state of mind and complexion -RRB- were given two chairs , but only one desk and one microscope .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 6]: Their conversation was strictly botanical .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 28]: Thenceforth it became the most pressing care of Ramsey 's life to prevent his roommate from learning that there was any conversation at all , even botanical .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 53]: Fortunately , Fred was not taking the biological courses , though he appeared to be taking the sentimental ones with an astonishing thoroughness ; and sometimes , to Fred 's hilarious delight , Ramsey attempted to turn the tables and rally him upon whatever last affair seemed to be engaging his fancy .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 29]: The old Victorian and pre-Victorian _ blague _ word `` petticoat '' had been revived in Fred 's vocabulary , and in others , as `` skirt . ''
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 32]: The lightsome sprig was hourly to be seen , even when university rulings forbade , dilly-dallying giddily along the campus paths or the town sidewalks with some new and pretty Skirt .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 27]: And when Ramsey tried to fluster him about such a matter Fred would profess his ardent love for the new lady in shouts and impromptu song .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 28]: Nothing could be done to him , and Ramsey , utterly unable to defend his own sensibilities in like manner , had always to retire in bafflement .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 24]: Sometimes he would ponder upon the question thus suggested : Why could n't he do this sort of thing , since Fred could ?
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 8]: But he never discovered a satisfying answer .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 49]: Ramsey 's watchfulness was so careful -LRB- lest he make some impulsive admission in regard to the botanical laboratory , for instance -RRB- that Mr. Mitchell 's curiosity gradually became almost quiescent ; but there arrived a day in February when it was piqued into the liveliest activity .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 27]: It was Sunday , and Fred , dressing with a fastidiousness ever his daily habit , noticed that Ramsey was exhibiting an unusual perplexity about neckties .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 23]: `` Keep the black one on , '' Fred said , volunteering the suggestion , as Ramsey muttered fiercely at a mirror .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 11]: `` It 's in better taste for church , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 11]: You 're going to church , are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 4]: Are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 8]: I 've got a luncheon engagement . ''
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 14]: `` Well , you could go to church first , could n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 15]: You better ; you 've got a lot of church absences against you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 8]: `` Then one more wo n't hurt .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 9]: No church in mine this morning , thanks !
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 17]: G'by , ole sox ; see you at the ` frat house ' for dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 17]: He went forth , whistling syncopations , and began a brisk trudge into the open country .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 32]: There was a professor 's daughter who also was not going to church that morning ; and she lived a little more than three miles beyond the outskirts of the town .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 42]: Unfortunately , as the weather was threatening , all others of her family abandoned the idea of church that day , and Fred found her before a cozy fire , but surrounded by parents , little brothers , and big sisters .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 37]: The professor was talkative ; Fred 's mind might have been greatly improved , but with a window in range he preferred a melancholy contemplation of the snow , which had begun to fall in quantity .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 38]: The professor talked until luncheon , throughout luncheon , and was well under way to fill the whole afternoon with talk , when Fred , repenting all the errors of his life , got up to go .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 53]: Heartily urged to remain , for there was now something just under a blizzard developing , he said No ; he had a great deal of `` cirriculum work '' to get done before the morrow , and passed from the sound of the professor 's hospitable voice and into the storm .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 26]: He had a tedious struggle against the wind and thickening snow , but finally came in sight of the town , not long before dark .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 39]: Here the road led down into a depression , and , lifting his head as he began the slight ascent on the other side , Fred was aware of two figures outlined upon the low ridge before him .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 22]: They were dimmed by the driving snow and their backs were toward him , but he recognized them with perfect assurance .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 8]: They were Dora Yocum and Ramsey Milholland .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 52]: They were walking so slowly that their advance was almost imperceptible , but it could be seen that Dora was talking with great animation ; and she was a graceful thing , thus gesticulating , in her long , slim fur coat with the white snow frosting her brown fur cap .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 19]: Ramsey had his hands deep in his overcoat pockets and his manner was wholly that of an audience .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 15]: Fred murmured to himself , '' ` What did you say to her ? '
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 4]: ` Nothin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 43]: I started to , but ' -- '' Then he put on a burst of speed and passed them , sweeping off his hat with operatic deference , yet hurrying by as if fearful of being thought a killjoy if he lingered .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 35]: He went to the `` frat house , '' found no one downstairs , and established himself in a red leather chair to smoke and ruminate merrily by a great fire in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 37]: Half an hour later Ramsey entered , stamped off the snow , hung up his hat and coat , and sat himself down defiantly in the red leather chair on the other side of the fireplace .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 10]: `` Well , go on , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 4]: `` Commence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 6]: `` Not at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 5]: Fred returned , amiably .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 6]: `` Fine spring weather to-day .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 15]: Lovely to see all the flowers and the birds as we go a-strolling by .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 10]: The little bobolinks -- '' `` You look here !
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 14]: That 's the only walk I ever took with her in my life .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 16]: I mean by -- by asking her and her saying she would and so forth .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 13]: That other time just sort of happened , and you know it .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 62]: Well , the weather was n't just the best in the world , maybe , but she 's an awful conscientious girl and once she makes an engagement -- '' `` Why , of course , '' Fred finished for him , `` She 'd be too pious to break it just on account of a mere little blizzard or anything .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 10]: Wonder how the weather will be next Sunday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 15]: `` I do n't know and I do n't care , '' said Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 18]: `` You do n't suppose I asked her to go _ again _ , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 26]: `` Well , for one thing , you do n't suppose I want her to think I 'm a perfect fool , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 12]: Fred mused a moment or two , looking at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 7]: `` What was the lecture ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 5]: he asked , mildly .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 5]: `` What lecture ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 25]: `` She seemed to me to be -- '' `` That was n't lecturing ; she was just -- '' `` Just what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 24]: `` Well ; she thinks war for the United States is coming closer and closer -- '' `` But it is n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 23]: `` Well , she thinks so , anyhow , '' said Ramsey , `` and she 's all broken up about it .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 25]: Of course she thinks we ought n't to fight and she 's trying to get everybody else she can to keep working against it .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 60]: She is n't goin ' home again next summer , she 's goin ' back to that settlement work in Chicago and work there among those people against our goin ' to war ; and here in college she wants to get everybody she can to talk against it , and -- '' `` What did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 13]: Fred asked , and himself supplied the reply : `` Nothin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 11]: I started to , but -- '' Ramsey got up .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 5]: `` Now look here !
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 37]: You know the ` frat ' passed a rule that if we broke any more furniture in this house with our scrappin ' we 'd both be fined the cost of repairs and five dollars apiece .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 24]: Well , I can afford five dollars this month better than you can , and -- '' `` I take it back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 5]: Fred interposed , hastily .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 24]: `` But you just listen to me ; you look out -- letting her think you 're on her side like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 12]: `` I do n't -- '' `` You _ do n't ?
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 6]: _ '' Ramsey looked dogged .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 65]: `` I 'm not goin ' around always arguin ' about everything when arguin ' would just hurt people 's feelings about something they 're all excited about , and would n't do a bit o ' good in the world -- and you know yourself just _ talk _ hardly ever settles anything -- so I do n't -- '' `` Aha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 3]: Fred cried .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 5]: `` I thought so !
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 12]: Now you listen to me -- '' `` I wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 11]: I -- '' But at this moment they were interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 35]: Someone slyly opened the door , and a snowball deftly thrown from without caught Ramsey upon the back of the neck and head , where it flattened and displayed itself as an ornamental star .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 48]: Shouting fiercely , both boys sprang up , ran to the door , were caught there in a barrage of snowballs , ducked through it in spite of all damage , charged upon a dozen besweatered figures awaiting them and began a mad battle in the blizzard .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 14]: Some of their opponents treacherously joined them , and turned upon the ambushers .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 55]: In the dusk the merry conflict waged up and down the snow-covered lawn , and the combatants threw and threw , or surged back and forth , or clenched and toppled over into snow banks , yet all coming to chant an extemporized battle-cry in chorus , even as they fought the most wildly .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 3]: `` Who ?
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 2]: Who ?
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 3]: Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 3]: they chanted .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 3]: `` Who ?
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 2]: Who ?
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 15]: _ Who _ says there ai n't goin ' to be no war ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 85]: Chapter XVIII So everywhere over the country , that winter of 1916 , there were light-hearted boys skylarking -- at college , or on the farms ; and in the towns the young machinists snowballed one another as they came from the shops ; while on this Sunday of the `` frat '' snow fight probably several hundreds of thousands of youthful bachelors , between the two oceans , went walking , like Ramsey , each with a girl who could forget the weather .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 23]: Yet boys of nineteen and in the twenties were not light-hearted all the time that winter and that spring and that summer .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 42]: Most of them knew long , thoughtful moments , as Ramsey did , when they seemed to be thinking not of girls or work or play -- nor of anything around them , but of some more vital matter or prospect .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 12]: And at such times they were grave , but not ungentle .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 60]: For the long strain was on the country ; underneath all its outward seeming of things going on as usual there shook a deep vibration , like the air trembling to vast organ pipes in diapasons too profound to reach the ear as sound : one felt , not heard , thunder in the ground under one 's feet .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 73]: The succession of diplomatic Notes came to an end after the torpedoing of the _ Sussex _ ; and at last the tricky ruling Germans in Berlin gave their word to murder no more , and people said , `` This means peace for America , and all is well for us , '' but everybody knew in his heart that nothing was well for us , that there was no peace .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 90]: They said `` All is well , '' while that thunder in the ground never ceased -- it grew deeper and heavier till all America shook with it and it became slowly audible as the voice of the old American soil wherein lay those who had defended it aforetime , a soil that bred those who would defend it again , for it was theirs ; and the meaning of it -- Life , Liberty , and the Pursuit of Happiness -- was theirs , and theirs to defend .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 21]: And they knew they would defend it , and that more than the glory of a Nation was at stake .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 8]: The Freedom of Man was at stake .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 52]: So , gradually , the sacred thunder reached the ears of the young men and gave them those deep moments that came to them whether they sat in the classroom or the counting-room , or walked with the plow , or stood to the machine , or behind the ribbon counter .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 20]: Thus the thunder shook them and tried them and slowly came into their lives and changed everything for them .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 57]: Hate of the Germans was not bred ; but a contempt for what Germany had shown in lieu of a national heart ; a contempt as mighty and profound as the resolve that the German way and the German will should prevail in America , nor in any country of the world that would be free .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 60]: And when the German Kaiser laid his command upon America , that no American should take his ship upon the free seas , death being the penalty for any who disobeyed , then the German Kaiser got his answer , not only to this new law he had made for us , but to many other thoughts of his .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 9]: Yet the answer was for some time delayed .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 26]: There was a bitter Sunday , and its bitterness went everywhere , to every place in the whole world that held high and generous hearts .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 36]: Its bitterness came to the special meeting in the `` Frat hall , '' where there were hearts , indeed , of that right sort , and one of them became vocal in its bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 41]: This was the heart of Fred Mitchell , who was now an authority , being president of the Junior Class , chairman of the Prom Committee , and other things pleasant to be and to live for at his age .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 34]: `` For me , Brothers , '' he said , `` I 'd think I 'd a great deal rather have been shot through the head than heard the news from Washington to-day !
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 32]: I tell you , I 've spent the meanest afternoon I ever did in my life , and I guess it 's been pretty much the same with all of us .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 22]: The worst of it is , it looks as though there is n't a thing in the world we can do .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 32]: The country 's been betrayed by a few blatherskites and boneheads that had the power to do it , and all we can do we 've just got to stand it .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 32]: But there 's some Americans that are n't just standing it , and I want to tell you a lot of 'em are men from the universities , just like us .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 22]: They 're _ over there _ right now ; they have n't said much -- they just packed up and went .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 41]: They 're flying for France and for England and for Canada ; they 're fighting under every flag on the right side of the Western Front ; and they 're driving ambulances at Verdun and ammunition trucks at the Somme .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 30]: Well , there 's going to be a lot more American boys on all these jobs mighty soon , on account of what those men did in Congress to-day .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 46]: If they wo n't give us a chance to do something under our own flag , then we 'll have to go and do it under some other flag ; and I want to tell you I 'm one that 's going to _ go !
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 52]: _ I 'll stick it out in college up to Easter , and then if there 's still no chance to go under the Stars and Stripes I 'll maybe have to go under the flag my great-great-grandfather fought against in 1776 , but , anyhow , I 'll _ go !
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 22]: _ '' It was in speaking to Ramsey of this declaration that Dora said Fred was a `` dangerous firebrand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 23]: They were taking another February walk , but the February was February , 1917 ; and the day was dry and sunny .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 13]: `` It 's just about a year ago , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 5]: `` What is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 3]: Ramsey asked .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 8]: `` That first time we went walking .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 6]: Do n't you remember ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 8]: `` Oh , _ that _ day ?
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 9]: Yes , I remember it was snowing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 8]: `` And so cold and blowy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 3]: she added .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 8]: `` It seems a long time ago .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 8]: I like walking with you , Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 27]: You 're so quiet and solid -- I 've always felt I could talk to you just anyhow I pleased , and you would n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 15]: I 'll miss these walks with you when we 're out of college . ''
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 3]: He chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 6]: `` That 's funny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 25]: `` Because we 've only taken four besides this : two last year , and another week before last , and another last week .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 7]: This is only the fifth . ''
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 4]: `` Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 4]: Is that all ?
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 12]: It seemed to me we 'd gone ever so often ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 3]: She laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 23]: `` I 'm afraid you wo n't think that seems much as if I 'd liked going , but I really have .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 15]: And , by the way , you 've never called on me at all .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 12]: Perhaps it 's because I 've forgotten to ask you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 43]: `` Oh , no , '' Ramsey said , and scuffed his shoes on the path , presently explaining rather huskily that he `` never _ was _ much of a caller '' ; and he added , `` or anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 21]: `` Well , you must come if you ever care to , '' she said , with a big-sister graciousness .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 22]: `` The Dorm chaperon sits there , of course , but ours is a jolly one and you 'd like her .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 9]: You 've probably met her -- Mrs. Hustings ?
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 14]: -- when you 've called on other girls at our old shop . ''
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 27]: `` I never was much of a -- '' He paused , fearing that he might be repeating himself , and too hastily amended his intention .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 15]: `` I never liked any girl enough to go and call on her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 5]: `` Ramsey Milholland ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 30]: `` Why , when we were in school half the room used to be talking about how you and that pretty Milla -- '' `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 7]: Ramsey protested , again too hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 7]: `` I never called on her .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 6]: We just went walking . ''
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 9]: A moment later his colour suddenly became fiery .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 13]: `` I do n't mean -- I mean -- '' he stammered .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 26]: `` It was walking , of course -- I mean we did go out walking but it was n't walking like -- like this . ''
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 13]: He concluded with a fit of coughing which seemed to rack him .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 9]: Dora threw back her head and laughed delightfully .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 7]: `` Do n't you apologize ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 4]: she said . ''
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 32]: _ I _ did n't when I said it seemed to me that we 've gone walking so often , when in reality it 's only four or five times altogether .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 38]: I think I can explain , though : I think it came partly from a feeling I have that I can rely on you -- that you 're a good , solid , reliable sort of person .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 47]: I remember from the time we were little children , you always had a sort of worried , honest look in school ; and you used to make a dent in your forehead -- you meant it for a frown -- whenever I caught your eye .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 19]: You hated me so honestly , and you were so honestly afraid I would n't see it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 16]: `` Oh , no -- no -- '' `` Oh , yes -- yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 7]: she laughed , then grew serious .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 63]: `` My feeling about you -- that you were a person to be relied on , I mean -- I think it began that evening in our freshman year , after the _ Lusitania _ , when I stopped you on campus and you went with me , and I could n't help crying , and you were so nice and quiet .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 27]: I hardly realized then that it was the first time we 'd ever really talked together -- of course _ I _ did all the talking !
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 12]: -- and yet we 'd known each other so many years .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 6]: I thought of it afterward .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 61]: But what gave me such a different view of you , I 'd always thought you were one of that truculent sort of boys , always just bursting for a fight ; but you showed me you 'd really never had a fight in your life and hated fighting , and that you sympathized with my feeling about war . ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 13]: She stopped speaking to draw in her breath with a sharp sigh .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 15]: `` Ah , do n't you remember what I 've told you all along ?
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 15]: How it keeps coming closer and closer -- and now it 's almost here !
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 6]: Is n't it _ unthinkable ?
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 24]: _ And what can we do to stop it , we poor few who feel that we _ must _ stop it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 8]: `` Well -- '' Ramsey began uncomfortably .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 19]: `` Of course I -- I -- '' `` You ca n't do much , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 4]: `` I know .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 5]: None of us can .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 7]: What can any little group do ?
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 18]: There are so few of us among the undergraduates -- and only one in the whole faculty .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 7]: All the rest are for war .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 28]: But we must n't give up ; we must never feel afterward that we left anything undone ; we must fight to the last breath ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 5]: ` Fight ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 7]: he repeated wonderingly , then chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 15]: `` Oh , as a figure of speech , '' she said , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 15]: `` Our language is full of barbaric figures left over from the dark ages .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 7]: But , oh , Ramsey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 34]: -- she touched his sleeve -- `` I 've heard that Fred Mitchell is saying that he 's going to Canada after Easter , to try to get into the Canadian aviation corps .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 14]: If it 's true , he 's a dangerous firebrand , I think .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 5]: Is it true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 5]: `` I guess so .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 9]: He 's been talking that way some . ''
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 14]: `` But why do you _ let _ him talk that way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 18]: `` He 's your roommate ; surely you have more influence with him than anybody else has .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 32]: Could n't you -- '' He shook his head slowly , while upon his face the faintly indicated modellings of a grin hinted of an inner laughter at some surreptitious thought .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 24]: `` Well , you know , Fred says himself sometimes , I do n't seem to be much of a talker exactly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 4]: `` I know .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 6]: But do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 7]: That sort of thing is contagious .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 19]: Others will think they ought to go if he does ; he 's popular and quite a leader .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 9]: Ca n't you do anything with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 7]: She waited for him to answer .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 6]: `` Ca n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 3]: she insisted .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 11]: The grin had disappeared , and Ramsey grew red again .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 25]: He seemed to wish to speak , to heave with speech that declined to be spoken and would not rouse up from his inwards .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 5]: Finally he uttered words .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 20]: `` I -- I -- well , I -- '' `` Oh , I know , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 8]: `` A man -- or a boy !
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 33]: -- always hates to be intruding his own convictions upon other men , especially in a case like this , where he might be afraid of some idiot 's thinking him unmanlike .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 25]: But Ramsey -- '' Suddenly she broke off and looked at him attentively ; his discomfort had become so obvious that suspicion struck her .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 4]: She spoke sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 18]: `` Ramsey _ you _ are n't dreaming of doing such a thing , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 7]: `` What such a thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 12]: `` Fred has n't influenced _ you _ , has he ?
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 13]: You are n't planning to go with him , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 8]: `` To join the Canadian aviation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 12]: `` No ; I had n't thought of doing it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 6]: She sighed again , relieved .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 23]: `` I had a queer feeling about you just then -- that you _ were _ thinking of doing some such thing .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 22]: You looked so odd -- and you 're always so quiet , anybody might not really know what you do think .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 14]: But I 'm not wrong about you , am I , Ramsey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 27]: They had come to the foot of the steps that led up to the entrance of her dormitory , and their walk was at an end .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 26]: As they stopped and faced each other , she looked at him earnestly ; but he did not meet the scrutiny , his eyelids fell .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 12]: `` I 'm not wrong , am I , Ramsey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 5]: `` About what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 5]: he murmured , uncomfortably .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 11]: `` You are my friend , are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 11]: `` Then it 's all right , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 33]: `` That relieves me and makes me happier than I was just now , for of course if you 're my friend you would n't let me make any mistake about you .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 49]: I believe you , and now , just before I go in and we wo n't see much of each other for a week -- if you still want me to go with you again next Sunday -- '' `` Yes -- wo n't you , please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 7]: `` Yes , if you like .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 60]: But I want to tell you now that I count on you in all this , even though you do n't ` talk much , ' as you say ; I count on you more than I do on anybody else , and I trust you when you say you 're my friend , and it makes me happy .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 11]: And I think perhaps you 're right about Fred Mitchell .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 17]: Talk is n't everything , nobody knows that better than I , who talk so much !
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 28]: and I think that , instead of talking to Fred , a steady , quiet influence like yours would do more good than any amount of arguing .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 8]: So I trust you , you see ?
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 13]: And I 'm sorry I had that queer doubt of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 6]: She held out her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 27]: `` Unless I happen to see you on the campus for a minute , in the meantime , it 's good-bye until a week from to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 11]: So -- well , so , good-bye until then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 7]: `` Wait , '' said Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 6]: He made a great struggle .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 14]: `` I 'm not influencing Fred not to go , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 17]: `` I -- do n't want you to trust me to do anything like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 23]: `` I think it 's all right for him to go , if he wants to , '' Ramsey said , miserably .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 4]: `` You do ?
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 8]: For him to go to _ fight ?
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 5]: _ '' He swallowed .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 5]: `` Yes . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 3]: _ Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 18]: _ '' she cried , turned even redder than he , and ran up the stone steps .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 31]: But before the storm doors closed upon her she looked down to where he stood , with his eyes still lowered , a lonely-seeming figure , upon the pavement below .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 10]: Her voice caught upon a sob as she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 23]: `` If you feel like that , you might as well go and enlist , yourself , '' she said , bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 17]: `` I ca n't -- I could n't -- speak to you again after this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 48]: Chapter XIX It was easy enough for him to evade Fred Mitchell 's rallyings these days ; the sprig 's mood was truculent , not toward his roommate but toward Congress , which was less in fiery haste than he to be definitely at war with Germany .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 48]: All through the university the change had come : athletics , in other years spotlighted at the centre of the stage , languished suddenly , threatened with abandonment ; students working for senior honours forgot them ; everything was forgotten except that growing thunder in the soil .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 18]: Several weeks elapsed after Dora 's bitter dismissal of Ramsey before she was mentioned between the comrades .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 26]: Then , one evening , Fred asked , as he restlessly paced their study floor : `` Have you seen your pacifist friend lately ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 3]: Not exactly .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 22]: `` Well , for my part , I think she ought to be locked up , '' Fred said , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 11]: `` Have you heard what she did this afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 7]: `` It 's all over college .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 13]: She got up in the class in jurisprudence and made a speech .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 17]: It 's a big class , you know , over two hundred , under Dean Burney .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 26]: He 's a great lecturer , but he 's a pacifist -- the only one on the faculty -- and a friend of Dora 's .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 37]: They say he encouraged her to make this break and led the subject around so she could do it , and then called on her for an opinion , as the highest-stand student in the class .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 46]: She got up and claimed there was n't any such thing as a legitimate cause for war , either legally or morally , and said it was a sign of weakness in a nation for it to believe that it did have cause for war .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 24]: `` Well , it was too much for that little , spunky Joe Stansbury , and he jumped up and argued with her .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 61]: He made her admit all the Germans have done to us , the sea murders and the land murders , the blowing up of the factories , the propaganda , the strikes , trying to turn the United States into a German settlement , trying to get Japan and Mexico to make war on us , and all the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 51]: He even made her admit there was proof they mean to conquer us when they get through with the others , and that they 've set out to rule the world for their own benefit , and make whoever else they kindly allow to live , to work for them .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 32]: `` She said it might be true , but since nothing at all could be a right cause for war , than all this could n't be a cause of war .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 46]: Of course she had her regular pacifist ` logic ' working ; she said that since war is the worst thing there is , why , all other evils were lesser , and a lesser evil ca n't be a just cause for a greater .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 15]: She got terribly excited , they say , but kept right on , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 50]: She said war was murder and there could n't be any other way to look at it ; and she 'd heard there was already talk in the university of students thinking about enlisting , and whoever did such a thing was virtually enlisting to return murder for murder .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 42]: Then Joe Stansbury asked her if she meant that she 'd feel toward any student that enlisted the way she would toward a murderer , and she said , yes , she 'd have a horror of any student that enlisted .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 53]: `` Well , that broke up the class ; Joe turned from her to the platform and told old Burney that he was responsible for allowing such talk in his lecture-room , and Joe said so far as _ he _ was concerned , he resigned from Burney 's classes right there .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 17]: That started it , and practically the whole class got up and walked out with Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 31]: They said Burney streaked off home , and Dora was left alone in there , with her head down on her desk -- and I guess she certainly deserves it .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 11]: A good many have already stopped speaking to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 13]: Ramsey fidgeted with a pen on the table by which he sat .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 28]: `` Well , I do n't know , '' he said , slowly ; `` I do n't know if they ought to do that exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 7]: `` Why ought n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 5]: Fred demanded , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 18]: `` Well , it looks to me as if she was only fightin ' for her principles .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 5]: She believes in 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 30]: The more it costs a person to stick to their principles , why , the more I believe the person must have something pretty fine about 'em likely . ''
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 5]: said the hot-headed Fred .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 22]: `` That may be in ordinary times , but not when a person 's principles are liable to betray their country !
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 19]: We wo n't stand that kind of principles , I tell you , and we ought n't to .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 10]: Dora Yocum 's finding that out , all right .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 51]: She had the biggest position of any girl in this place , or any boy either , up to the last few weeks , and there was n't any student or hardly even a member of the faculty that had the influence or was more admired and looked up to .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 6]: She had the whole show !
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 50]: But now , since she 's just the same as called any student a murderer if he enlists to fight for his country and his flag -- well , now she has n't got anything at all , and if she keeps on she 'll have even less ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 31]: He paused in his walking to and fro and came to a halt behind his friend 's chair , looking down compassionately upon the back of Ramsey 's motionless head .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 4]: His tone changed .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 23]: `` I guess it is n't just the ticket -- me to be talking this way to you , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 9]: he said , with a trace of huskiness .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 17]: `` Oh -- it 's all right , '' Ramsey murmured , not altering his position .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 13]: `` I ca n't help blowing up , '' Fred went on .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 25]: `` I want to say , though , I know I 'm not very considerate to blow up about her to you this way .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 67]: I 've been playing horse with you about her ever since freshman year , but -- well , you must have understood , Ram , I never meant anything that would really bother you much , and I thought -- well , I _ really _ thought it was a good thing , you -- your -- well , I mean about her , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 7]: I 'm on , all right .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 10]: I know it 's pretty serious with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 3]: He paused .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 19]: Ramsey did not move , except that his right hand still fidgeted with the pen upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 9]: `` Oh -- well -- '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 12]: `` It 's -- it 's kind of tough luck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 15]: his friend contrived to say ; and he began to pace the floor again .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 19]: `` Oh -- well -- '' `` See here , ole stick-in-the-mud , '' Fred broke out abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 29]: `` After her saying what she did -- Well , it 's none o ' my business , but -- but -- '' `` Well , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 3]: Ramsey murmured .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 17]: `` I do n't care what you say , if you want to say anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 19]: `` Well , I _ got _ to say it , '' Fred half groaned and half blurted .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 37]: `` After she said _ that _ -- and she meant it -- why , if I were in your place I 'd be darned if I 'd be seen out walking with her again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 14]: `` I 'm not going to be , '' Ramsey said , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 5]: `` By George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 14]: And now Fred halted in front of him , both being huskily solemn .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 22]: `` I think I understand a little of what that means to you , old Ramsey ; I think I do .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 21]: I think I know something of what it costs you to make that resolution for your country 's sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 6]: Impulsively he extended his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 12]: `` It 's a pretty big thing for you to do .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 6]: Will you shake hands ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 6]: But Ramsey shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 7]: `` I did n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 17]: I would n't ever have done anything just on account of her talkin ' that way .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 15]: She shut the door on me -- it was a good while ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 4]: `` She did !
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 4]: What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 28]: `` Well , I 'm not much of a talker , you know , Fred , '' said Ramsey , staring at the pen he played with .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 29]: `` I 'm not much of anything , for that matter , prob ` ly , but I -- well -- I -- '' `` You what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 19]: `` Well , I had to tell her I did n't feel about things the way she did .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 12]: She 'd thought I had , all along , I guess .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 20]: Anyway , it made her hate me or something , I guess ; and she called it all off .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 20]: I expect there was n't much to call off , so far as she was concerned , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 4]: He laughed feebly .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 11]: `` She told me I better go and enlist . ''
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 6]: `` Pleasant of her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 3]: Fred muttered .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 12]: `` Especially as we know what she thinks enlisting means . ''
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 6]: He raised his voice cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 27]: `` Well , that 's settled ; and , thank God , old Mr. Bernstorff 's on his way to his sweet little vine-clad cottage home !
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 19]: They 're getting guns on the ships , and the big show 's liable to commence any day .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 22]: We can hold up our heads now , and we 're going to see some great times , old Ramsey boy !
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 10]: It 's hard on the home folks -- Gosh !
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 9]: I do n't like to think of that !
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 87]: And I guess it 's going to be hard on a lot of boys that have n't understood what it 's all about , and hard on some that their family affairs , and business , and so on , have got 'em tied up so it 's hard to go -- and of course there 's plenty that just ca n't , and some that are n't husky enough -- but the rest of us are going to have the big time in our lives .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 28]: We got an awful lot to learn ; it scares me to think of what I do n't know about being any sort of a rear-rank private .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 24]: Why , it 's a regular _ profession _ , like practising law , or selling for a drug house on the road .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 2]: Golly !
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 29]: Do you remember how we talked about that , ` way back in freshman year , what we were going to do when we got out of college ?
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 44]: You were going to be practising law , for instance , and I -- well , f ' r instance , remember Colburn ; he was going to be a doctor , and he did go to some medical school for one year .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 14]: Now he 's in the Red Cross , somewhere in _ Persia _ .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 3]: Golly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 12]: He paused to digest this impossibility , then chattered briskly on .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 37]: `` Well , there 's _ one _ good old boy was with our class for a while , back in freshman year ; I bet we wo n't see him in any good old army !
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 13]: Old rough-neck Linski that you put the knob on his nose for .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 65]: Tommie Hopper says he saw him last summer in Chicago soapboxin ' , yellin ' his head off cussin ' every government under the sun , but mostly ours and the Allies ' , you bet , and going to run the earth by revolution and representatives of unskilled labour immigrants , nobody that can read or write allowed to vote , except Linski .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 36]: Tommie Hopper says he knows all about Linski ; he never did a day 's work in his life -- too busy trying to get the workingmen stirred up against the people that exploit 'em !
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 27]: Tommie says he had a big crowd to hear him , though , and took up quite a little money for a 'cause ' or something .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 6]: Well , let him holler !
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 15]: I guess we can attend to him when we get back from over yonder .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 18]: By George , old Ram , I 'm gettin ' kind of floppy in the gills ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 11]: He administered a resounding slap to his comrade 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 15]: `` It certainly looks as if our big days were walking toward us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 4]: He was right .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 17]: The portentous days came on apace , and each one brought a new and greater portent .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 51]: The faces of men lost a driven look besetting them in the days of badgered waiting , and instead of that heavy apprehension one saw the look men 's faces must have worn in 1776 and 1861 , and the history of the old days grew clearer in the new .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 50]: The President went to the Congress , and the true indictment he made there reached scoffing Potsdam with an unspoken prophecy somewhat chilling even to Potsdam , one guesses -- and then through an April night went almost quietly the steady work : we were at war with Germany .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 28]: The bugles sounded across the continent ; drums and fifes played up and down the city streets and in town and village squares and through the countrysides .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 36]: Faintly in all ears there was multitudinous noise like distant , hoarse cheering ... and a sound like that was what Dora Yocum heard , one night , as she sat lonely in her room .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 47]: The bugles and fifes and drums had been heard about the streets of the college town , that day , and she thought she must die of them , they hurt her so , and now to be haunted by this imaginary cheering -- She started .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 4]: Was it imaginary ?
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 16]: She went downstairs and stood upon the steps of the dormitory in the open air .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 9]: No ; the cheering was real and loud .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 20]: It came from the direction of the railway station , and the night air surged and beat with it .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 12]: Below her stood the aged janitor of the building , listening .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 8]: `` What 's the cheering for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 24]: she asked , remembering grimly that the janitor was one of her acquaintances who had not yet stopped `` speaking '' to her .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 13]: `` It 's a good matter , '' the old man answered .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 14]: `` I guess there must be a big crowd of 'em down there .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 16]: One of our students enlisted to-day , and they 're givin ' him a send-off .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 11]: Listen to 'em , how they _ do _ cheer .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 9]: He 's the first one to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 21]: She went back to her room , shivering , and spent the next day in bed with an aching head .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 63]: She rose in the evening , however -- a handbill had been slid under her door at five o'clock , calling a `` Mass Meeting '' of the university at eight , and she felt it her duty to go ; but when she got to the great hall she found a seat in the dimmest corner , farthest from the rostrum .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 22]: The president of the university addressed the tumultuous many hundreds before him , for tumultuous they were until he quieted them .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 21]: He talked to them soberly of patriotism , and called upon them for `` deliberation and a little patience . ''
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 31]: There was danger of a stampede , he said , and he and the rest of the faculty were in a measure responsible to their fathers and mothers for them .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 11]: `` You must keep your heads , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 33]: `` God knows , I do not seek to judge your duty in this gravest moment of your lives , nor assume to tell you what you must or must not do .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 33]: But by hurrying into service now , without careful thought or consideration , you may impair the extent of your possible usefulness to the very cause you are so anxious to serve .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 23]: Hundreds of you are taking technical courses which should be completed -- at least to the end of the term in June .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 32]: Instructors from the United States Army are already on the way here , and military training will be begun at once for all who are physically eligible and of acceptable age .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 27]: A special course will be given in preparation for flying , and those who wish to become aviators may enroll themselves for the course at once .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 39]: `` I speak to you in a crisis of the university 's life , as well as that of the nation , and the warning I utter has been made necessary by what took place yesterday and to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 20]: Yesterday morning , a student in the junior class enlisted as a private in the United States Regular Army .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 36]: Far be it from me to deplore his course in so doing ; he spoke to me about it , and in such a way that I felt I had no right to dissuade him .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 46]: I told him that it would be preferable for college men to wait until they could go as officers , and , aside from the fact of a greater prestige , I urged that men of education could perhaps be more useful in that capacity .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 36]: He replied that if he were useful enough as a private a commission might in time come his way , and , as I say , I did not feel at liberty to attempt dissuasion .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 26]: He left to join a regiment to which he had been assigned , and many of you were at the station to bid him farewell .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 28]: `` But enthusiasm may be too contagious ; even a great and inspiring motive may work for harm , and the university must not become a desert .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 55]: In the twenty-four hours since that young man went to join the army last night , one hundred and eleven of our young men students have left our walls ; eighty-four of them went off together at three o'clock to catch an east-bound train at the junction and enlist for the Navy at Newport .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 13]: We are , I say , in danger of a stampede . ''
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 29]: He spoke on , but Dora was not listening ; she had become obsessed by the idea which seemed to be carrying her to the border of tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 21]: When the crowd poured forth from the building she went with it mechanically , and paused in the dark outside .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 11]: She spoke to a girl whom she did not know .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 11]: `` I beg your pardon -- '' `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 18]: `` I wanted to ask : Do you know who was the student Doctor Corvis spoke of ?
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 32]: I mean the one that was the first to enlist , and that they were cheering last night when he went away to be a private in the United States Army .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 9]: Did you happen to hear his name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 9]: `` Yes , he was a junior . ''
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 6]: `` Who was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 5]: `` Ramsey Milholland . ''
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 74]: Chapter XX Fred Mitchell , crossing the campus one morning , ten days later , saw Dora standing near the entrance of her dormitory , where he would pass her unless he altered his course ; and as he drew nearer her and the details of her face grew into distinctness , he was indignant with himself for feeling less and less indignation toward her in proportion to the closeness of his approach .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 26]: The pity that came over him was mingled with an unruly admiration , causing him to wonder what unpatriotic stuff he could be made of .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 30]: She was marked , but not whipped ; she still held herself straight under all the hammering and cutting which , to his knowledge , she had been getting .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 44]: She stopped him , `` for only a moment , '' she said , adding with a wan profoundness : `` That is , if you 're not one of those who feel that I should n't be ` spoken to ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 9]: `` No , '' said Fred , stiffly .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 28]: `` I may share their point of view , perhaps , but I do n't feel called upon to obtrude it on you in that manner . ''
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 10]: `` I see , '' she said , nodding .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 12]: `` I 've wanted to speak with you about Ramsey . ''
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 5]: `` All right . ''
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 18]: She bit her lip , then asked , abruptly : `` What made him do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 10]: `` Enlist as a private with the regulars ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 8]: What made him enlist at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 13]: `` Only because he 's that sort , '' Fred returned briskly .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 36]: `` He may be inexplicable to people who believe that his going out to fight for his country is the same thing as going out to commit a mur -- '' She lifted her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 18]: `` Could n't you -- '' `` I beg your pardon , '' Fred said at once .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 19]: `` I 'm sorry , but I do n't know just how to explain him to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 5]: He laughed , apologetically .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 43]: `` Well , you see , as I understand it , you do n't think it 's possible for a person to have something within him that makes him care so much about his country that he -- '' `` Wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 22]: `` Do n't you think I 'm willing to suffer a little rather than to see my country in the wrong ?
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 10]: Do n't you think I 'm doing it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 42]: `` Well , I do n't want to be rude ; but , of course , it seems to me that you 're suffering because you think you know more about what 's right and wrong than anybody else does . ''
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 5]: `` Oh , no .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 21]: But I -- '' `` We would n't get anywhere , probably , by arguing it , '' Fred said .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 6]: `` You asked me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 12]: `` I asked you to tell my why he enlisted . ''
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 22]: `` The trouble is , I do n't think I _ can _ tell that to anybody who needs an answer .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 7]: He just went , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 8]: There is n't any question about it .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 12]: I always thought he 'd be the first to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 6]: `` Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 9]: `` Yes , I always thought so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 13]: `` I think you were mistaken , '' she said , decidedly .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 15]: `` It was a special reason -- to make him act so cruelly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 4]: `` Cruelly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 3]: Fred cried .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 5]: `` It _ was !
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 8]: _ '' `` Cruel to whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 11]: `` Oh , to his mother -- to his family .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 28]: To have him go off that way , without a word -- '' `` Oh , no ' he 'd been home , '' Fred corrected her .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 16]: `` He went home the Saturday before he enlisted , and settled it with them .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 44]: They 're all broken up , of course ; but when the saw he 'd made up his mind , they quit opposing him , and I think they 're proud of him about it , maybe , in spite of feeling anxious .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 42]: You see , his father was an artilleryman in the war with Spain , and his grandfather was a Colonel at the end of the War of the Rebellion , though he went into it as a private , like Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 27]: He died when Ramsey was about twelve ; but Ramsey remembers him ; he was talking of him a little the night before he enlisted . ''
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 8]: Dora made a gesture of despairing protest .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 7]: `` You do n't understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 10]: `` What is it I do n't understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 3]: `` Ramsey !
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 16]: _ I _ know why he went -- and it 's just killing me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 6]: Fred looked at her gravely .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 15]: `` I do n't think you need worry about it , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 14]: `` There 's nothing about his going that you are responsible for . ''
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 6]: She repeated her despairing gesture .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 6]: `` You do n't understand .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 6]: But it 's no use .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 22]: It does n't help any to try to talk of it , though I thought maybe it would , somehow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 18]: She went a little nearer the dormitory entrance , leaving him where he was , then turned .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 10]: `` I suppose you wo n't see him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 12]: Most probably not till we meet-if we should -- in France .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 23]: I do n't know where he 's stationed ; and I 'm going with the aviation -- if it 's ever ready !
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 19]: And he 's with the regulars ; he 'll probably be among the first to go over . ''
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 5]: `` I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 15]: She turned sharply away , calling back over her shoulder in a choked voice .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 3]: Good-bye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 47]: But Fred 's heart had melted ; gazing after her , he saw that her proud young head had lowered now , and that her shoulders were moving convulsively ; he ran after her and caught her as she began slowly to ascend the dormitory steps .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 8]: `` See here , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 11]: `` Do n't -- '' She lifted a wet face .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 5]: `` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 15]: He went in bitterness because I told him to , in my own bitterness !
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 5]: I 've killed him !
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 36]: Long ago , when he was n't much more than a child , I heard he 'd said that some day he 'd ` show ' me , and now he 's done it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 10]: Fred whistled low and long when she had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 4]: `` Girls ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 5]: he murmured to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 11]: `` Some girls , anyhow -- they will be girls !
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 19]: You ca n't tell 'em what 's what , and you ca n't change 'em , either ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 27]: Then , as more urgent matters again occupied his attention , he went on at an ardent and lively gait to attend his class in map-making .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 40]: Chapter XXI That thunder in the soil , at first too deep within it to be audible , had come to the surface now and gradually became heard as the thunder of a million feet upon the training grounds .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 36]: The bugles rang sharper ; the drums and fifes of town and village and countryside were the drums and fifes of a war that came closer and closer to every hearth between the two oceans .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 20]: All the old symbols became symbols bright and new , as if no one had ever seen them before .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 21]: `` America '' was like a new word , and the song `` America '' was like a new song .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 42]: All the dusty blatancies of orating candidates , seeking to rouse bored auditors with `` the old flag '' ; all the mechanical patriotics of school and church and club ; all these time-worn flaccid things leaped suddenly into living colour .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 28]: The flag became brilliant and strange to see -- strange with a meaning that seemed new , a meaning long known , yet never known till now .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 22]: And so hearts that thought they knew themselves came upon ambushes of emotion and hidden indwellings of spirit not guessed before .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 49]: Dora Yocum , listening to the `` Star Spangled Banner , '' sung by children of immigrants to an out-of-tune old piano in a mission clubroom , in Chicago , found herself crying with a soul-shaking heartiness in a way different from other ways that she had cried .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 23]: Among the many things she thought of then was this : That the banner the children were singing about was in danger .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 39]: The great country , almost a continent , had always seemed so untouchable , so safe and sure ; she had never been able to conceive of a hostile power mighty enough to shake or even jar it .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 33]: And since so great and fundamental a thing could not be injured , a war for its defence had appeared to be , in her eyes , not only wicked but ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 42]: At last , less and less vaguely , she had come to comprehend something of the colossal German threat , and the shadow that touched this bright banner of which the immigrants ' children piped so briskly in the mission club-room .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 26]: She had begun to understand , though she could not have told just why , or how , or at what moment understanding reached her .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 62]: She began to understand that her country , threatened to the life , had flung its line those thousands of miles across the sea to stand and hold Hindenburg and Ludendorff and all their Kaisers , Kings , Dukes , and Crown Princes , their Krupp and Skoda monstrous engines , and their monstrous other engines of men made into armies .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 40]: Through the long haze of misted sea-miles and the smoke of land-miles she perceived that brown line of ours , and knew it stood there that Freedom , and the Nation itself , might not perish from the earth .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 30]: And so , a week later , she went home , and came nervously to Ramsey 's mother and found how to direct the letter she wanted to write .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 5]: He was in France .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 12]: As the old phrase went , she poured out her heart .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 8]: It seems to apply to her letter .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 8]: She wrote : Do n't misunderstand me .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 18]: I felt that my bitter speech to you had driven you to take the step you did .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 33]: I felt that I had sent you to be killed , and that I ought to be killed for doing it , but I knew that you had other motives , too .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 59]: I knew , of course , that you thought of the country more than you did of me , or of any mad thing I would say -- but I thought that what I said might have been the prompting thing , the word that threw you into it so hastily and before you were ready , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 8]: I dreaded to bear that terrible responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 5]: I hope you understand .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 44]: My great mistake has been -- I thought I sas so `` logical '' -- it 's been in my starting everything with a thought I 'd never proven ; that war is the worst thing , and all other evils were lesser .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 4]: I was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 12]: I was wrong , because war is n't the worst evil .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 29]: Slavery is the worse evil , and now I want to tell you I have come to see that you are making war on those that make slavery .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 34]: Yes , you are fighting those that make both war and slavery , and you are right , and I humbly reverence and honour all of you who are in this right war .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 62]: I have come home to work in the Red Cross here ; I work there all day , and all day I keep saying to myself -- but I really mean to _ you _ -- it 's what I pray , and oh , how I pray it : `` God be with you and grant you the victory ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 9]: For you must win and you will win .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 18]: Forgive me , oh , please -- and if you will , could you write to me ?
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 23]: I know you have things to do more important than `` girls '' -- but oh , could n't you , please ?
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 39]: This letter , which she had taken care not to dampen , as she wrote , went in slow course to the `` American Expeditionary Forces in France , '' and finally found him whom it patiently sought .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 24]: He delayed not long to answer , and in time she held in a shaking hand the pencilled missive he had sent her .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 16]: You forget all that comic talk about me enlisting because of your telling me to .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 25]: I 'd written my father I was going at the first chance a month and a half before that day when you said it .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 33]: My mind was made up at the first time there was any talk of war , and you had about as much responsibility for my going as some little sparrow or something .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 55]: Of course I do n't mean I did n't pay any attention to the different things you said , because I always did , and I used to worry over it because I was afraid some day it would get you in trouble , and I 'm mighty glad you 've cut it out .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 11]: That 's right ; you be a regular girl now .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 12]: You always were one , and I knew it all right .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 31]: I 'm not as scared to write to you as I was to talk to you , so I guess you know I was mighty tickled to get your letter .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 12]: It sounded blue , but I was glad to get it .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 10]: You _ bet _ I 'll write to you !
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 18]: I do n't suppose you could have any idea how glad I was to get your letter .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 23]: I could sit here and write to you all day if they 'd let me , but I 'm a corporal now .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 34]: When you answer this , I wish you 'd say how the old town looks and if the grass in the front yards is as green as it usually is , and everything .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 23]: And tell me some more about everything you think of when you are working down at the Red Cross like you said .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 17]: I guess I 've read your letter five million times , and that part ten million .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 22]: I mean where you underlined that '' _ you _ '' and what you said to yourself at the Red Cross .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 12]: Oh , murder , but I was glad to read that !
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 13]: Do n't forget about writing anything else you think of like that .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 13]: Well , I was interrupted then and this is the next day .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 31]: Of course , I ca n't tell you where we are , because that darned censor will read this letter , but I guess he will let this much by .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 12]: Who do you think I ran across in a village yesterday ?
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 18]: Two boys from the old school days , and we certainly did shake hands a few times !
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 16]: It was the old foolish Dutch Krusemeyer and Albert Paxton , both of them lieutenants .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 22]: I heard Fred Mitchell is still training in the States and about crazy because they wo n't send him over yet .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 24]: If you had any idea how glad I was to get your letter , you would n't lose any time answering this one .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 30]: Anyhow , I 'm going to write to you again every few days if I get the chance , because maybe you 'll answer more than one of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 16]: But see here , cut out that `` sent you to be killed '' stuff .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 8]: You 've got the wrong idea altogether .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 22]: We 've got the big job of our lives , we know that , but we 're going to do it .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 15]: There 'll be mistakes and bad times , but we wo n't fall down .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 64]: Now you 'll excuse me for saying it this way , Dora , but I do n't know just how to express myself except saying of course we know everybody is n't going to get back home -- but listen , we did n't come over here to get killed particularly , we came over here to give these Dutchmen h -- l !
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 30]: Perhaps you can excuse language if I write it with a blank like that , but before we get back we 're going to do what we came for .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 36]: They may not all of them be as bad as some of them -- it 's a good thing you do n't know what we do , because some of it would make you sick .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 38]: As I say , there may be quite a lot of good ones among them ; but we know what they 've done to this country , and we know what they mean to do to ours .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 9]: So we 're going to attend to them .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 9]: Of course that 's why I 'm here .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 5]: It was n't you .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 10]: Do n't forget to write pretty soon , Dora .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 31]: You say in your letter -- I certainly was glad to get that letter -- well , you say I have things to do more important than `` girls . ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 70]: Dora , I think you probably know without my saying so that of course while I have got important things to do , just as every man over here has , and everybody at home , for that matter , well , the thing that is most important in the world to me , next to helping win this war , it 's reading the next letter from you .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 29]: Do n't forget how glad I 'll be to get it , and do n't forget you did n't have anything to do with my being over here .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 8]: That was -- it was something else .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 12]: And you bet , whatever happens I 'm glad I came !
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 8]: Do n't ever forget _ that _ !
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 9]: Dora knew it was `` something else . ''
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 58]: Her memory went back to her first recollection of him in school : from that time on he had been just an ordinary , everyday boy , floundering somehow through his lessons in school and through his sweethearting with Milla , as the millions of other boys floundered along with their own lessons and their own Millas .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 58]: She saw him swinging his books and romping homeward from the schoolhouse , or going whistling by her father 's front yard , rattling a stick on the fence as he went , care-free and masterful , but shy as a deer if strangers looked at him , and always `` not much of a talker . ''
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 17]: She had always felt so superior to him , she shuddered as she thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 11]: His quiet had been so much better than her talk .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 23]: His intelligence was proven now , when it came to the great test , to be of a stronger sort than hers .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 13]: He was wise and good and gentle -- and a fighting man !
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 19]: `` We know what they 've done to this country and what they mean to do to ours .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 10]: So we 're going to attend to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 42]: She read this over , and she knew that Ramsey , wise and gentle and good , would fight like an unchained devil , and that he and his comrades would indeed and indeed do what they `` came for . ''
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 10]: `` It was n't you , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 15]: She nodded gently , agreeing , and knew what it was that sent him .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 14]: Yet Ramsey had his own secret there , and did not tell it .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 23]: Sometimes there rose , faint in his memory , a whimsical picture , yet one that had always meant much to him .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 73]: He would see an old man sitting with a little boy upon a rustic bench under a walnut tree to watch the `` Decoration Day Parade '' go by -- and Ramsey would see a shoot of sunshine that had somehow got through the walnut tree and made a bedazzlement of glinting fine lines over a spot about the size of a saucer , upon the old man 's thick white hair .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 60]: And in Ramsey 's memory , the little boy , sitting beside the veteran , would half close his eyes , drowsily , playing that this sunshine spot was a white bird 's - nest , until he had a momentary dream of a glittering little bird that dwelt there and wore a blue soldier cap on its head .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 23]: And Ramsey would bring out of his memory thoughts that the old man had got into the child 's head that day .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 82]: `` We knew that armies fighting for the Freedom of Man _ had _ to win , in the long run ... We were on the side of God 's Plan ... Long ago we began to see hints of His Plan ... Man has to win his freedom from himself -- men in the light have to fight against men in the dark ... That light is the answer ... We had the light that made us never doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 24]: A long while Dora sat with the letter in her hand before she answered it and took it upon her heart to wear .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 26]: That was the place for it , since it was already within her heart , where he would find it when he came home again .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 9]: And she beheld the revelation sent to her .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 27]: This ordinary life of Ramsey 's was but the outward glinting of a high and splendid spirit , as high and splendid as earth can show .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 13]: And yet it was only the life of an everyday American boy .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 15]: The streets of the town were full , now , of boys like Ramsey .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 19]: At first they were just boys in uniform ; then one saw that they were boys no more .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 4]: They were soldiers .
