Parsing [sent. 1 len. 24]: A MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE BY GORDON HOLMES NEW YORK EDWARD J. CLODE 156 FIFTH AVENUE 1905 CHAPTER I `` LAST SEEN AT VICTORIA ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 38]: Alice , Lady Dyke , puckered her handsome forehead into a thoughtful frown as she drew aside the window-curtains of her boudoir and tried to look out into the opaque blackness of a November fog in London .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 9]: Behind her was cheerfulness -- in front uncertainty .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 36]: Electric lights , a nice fire reflected from gleaming brass , the luxury of carpets and upholstery , formed an alluring contrast to the dull yellow glare of a solitary lamp in the outer obscurity .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 8]: But Lady Dyke was a strong-minded woman .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 14]: There was no trace of doubt in the wrinkled brows and reflective eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 20]: She held back the curtains with her left hand , buttoning a glove at the wrist with the other .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 25]: Fog or no fog , she would venture forth , and she was already dressed for the weather in tailor-made costume and winter toque .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 11]: She was annoyed , but not disconcerted by the fog .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 11]: Too long had she allowed herself to take things easily .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 26]: The future was as murky as the atmosphere ; the past was dramatically typified by the pleasant surroundings on which she resolutely turned her back .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 32]: Lady Dyke was quite determined as to her actions , and a dull November night was a most unlikely agent to restrain her from following the course she had mapped out .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 18]: Moving to the light again , she took from her pocket a long , closely written letter .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 25]: Its details were familiar to her , but her face hardened as she hastily ran through it in order to find a particular passage .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 15]: At last she gained her object -- to make quite sure of an address .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 18]: Then she replaced the document , stood undecided for a moment , and touched an electric bell .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 19]: `` James , '' she said , to the answering footman , `` I am going out . ''
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 6]: `` Yes , milady . ''
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 9]: `` Sir Charles is not at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 6]: `` No , milady . ''
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 12]: `` I am going to Richmond -- to see Mrs. Talbot .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 10]: I shall probably not return in time for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 10]: Tell Sir Charles not to wait for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 11]: `` Shall I order the carriage for your ladyship ? ''
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 14]: `` Will you listen to me and remember what I have said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 6]: `` Yes , milady . ''
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 38]: James ran downstairs , opened the door , bowed as Lady Dyke passed into Portman Square , and then confidentially informed Buttons that `` the missus '' was in a `` rare old wax '' about something .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 24]: `` She nearly jumped down my bloomin ' throat when I asked her if she would have the carriage , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 36]: Her ladyship 's mood did not soften when she drifted from the fixed tenure of Wensley House , Portman Square , into the chaos of Oxford Street and fog at 5.30 on a November evening .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 18]: Though not a true `` London particular , '' the fog was chilly , exasperating , tedious .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 27]: People bumped against each other without apology , ` buses crunched through the traffic with deadly precision , pair-horse vans swept around corners with magnificent carelessness .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 35]: In the result , Lady Dyke , who meant to walk , as she was somewhat in advance of the time she had fixed on for this very important engagement , took a hansom .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 9]: In her present mood slight things annoyed her .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 38]: Usually , the London cab-horse is a thoughtful animal ; he refuses to hurry ; when he falls he lies contented , secure in the knowledge that for five blissful minutes he will be at complete rest .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 20]: But this misguided quadruped flew as though oats and meadow-grass awaited him at Victoria Station on the Underground Railway .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 29]: He raced down Park Lane , skidded past Hyde Park Corner , and grated the off-wheel of the hansom against the kerb outside the station within eight minutes .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 25]: In other words , her ladyship , if she would obey the directions contained in the voluminous letter , was compelled to kill time .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 41]: As she stepped from the vehicle and halted beneath a lamp to take a florin from her purse , a tall , ulster-wrapped gentleman , walking rapidly into Victoria Street , caught a glimpse of her face and well-proportioned form .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 6]: Instantly his hat was off .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 10]: `` This is an unexpected pleasure , Lady Dyke .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 8]: Can I be of any service ? ''
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 21]: She bit her lip , not unobserved , but the law of Society forced her features into a bright smile .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 10]: `` Oh , Mr. Bruce , is it you ?
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 10]: I am going to see my sister at Richmond .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 6]: Is n't the weather horrid ?
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 16]: I shall be so glad if you will put me into the right train . ''
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 39]: Mr. Claude Bruce , barrister and man about town , whose clean-cut features and dark , deep-set eyes made him as readily recognizable , knew that she would have been much better pleased had he passed without greeting .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 26]: Like the footman , he wondered why she did not drive in her carriage rather than travel by the Underground Railway on such a night .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 15]: He guessed that she was perturbed -- that her voluble explanation was a disguise .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 32]: He reflected that he could ill afford any delay in dressing for a distant dinner -- that good manners oft entail inconvenience -- but of course he said : `` Delighted .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 6]: Have you any wraps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 18]: `` No , I am just going for a chat , and shall be home early . ''
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 62]: He bought her a first-class ticket , noting as an odd coincidence that it bore the number of the year , 1903 , descended to the barrier , found that the next train for Richmond passed through in ten minutes , fumed inwardly for an instant , explained his presence to the ticket-collector , and paced the platform with his companion .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 20]: Having condemned the fog , and the last play , and the latest book , they were momentarily silent .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 22]: The newspaper placards on Smith & Son 's bookstall announced that a `` Great Society Scandal '' was on the tapis .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 23]: `` The Duke in the Box '' formed a telling line , and the eyes of both people chanced on it simultaneously .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 18]: Thought the woman : `` He is a man of the world , and an experienced lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 6]: Shall I tell him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 29]: Thought the man : `` She wants to take me into her confidence , and I am too busy to be worried by some small family squabble . ''
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 18]: Said she : `` Are you much occupied at the Courts just now , Mr. Bruce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 11]: `` No , '' he replied ; `` not exactly .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 8]: My practice is more consultive than active .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 28]: Many people seek my advice about matters of little interest , never thinking that they would best serve their ends by acting decisively and promptly themselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 6]: Lady Dyke set her lips .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 8]: She could be both prompt and decisive .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 40]: She resolved to keep her troubles , whatever they were , locked in the secrecy of her own heart , and when she next spoke of some trivial topic the barrister knew that he had been spared a recital .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 5]: He regretted it afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 20]: At any other moment in his full and useful life he would have encouraged her rather than the reverse .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 13]: Even now , a few seconds too late , he was sorry .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 35]: He strove to bring her back to the verge of explanations , but failed , for her ladyship was a proud , self-reliant personage -- one who would never dream of risking a rebuff .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 20]: A train came , with `` Richmond '' staring at them from the smoke and steam of the engine .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 4]: `` Good-bye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 4]: `` Good-bye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 9]: `` Shall I see you again soon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 5]: `` I fear not .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 16]: It is probable that I shall leave for the South of France quite early . ''
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 5]: And she was gone .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 16]: Her companion rushed to the street , and almost ran to his Victoria Street chambers .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 5]: It was six o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 16]: He had to dress and drive all the way to Hampstead for dinner at 7.30 .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 17]: * * * * * At ten minutes past nine Sir Charles Dyke entered Wensley House .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 11]: A handsome , quiet , gentlemanly man was Sir Charles .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 43]: He was rich -- a Guardsman until the baronetcy devolved upon him , a popular figure in Society , esteemed a trifle fast prior to his marriage , but sobered down by the cares of a great estate and a vast fortune .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 10]: His wife and he were not well-matched in disposition .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 13]: She was too earnest , too prim , for the easy-going baronet .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 8]: He respected her , that was all .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 22]: A man of his nature found it impossible to realize that the depths of passion are frequently coated over with ice .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 29]: Their union was irreproachable , like their marriage settlements ; but there are more features in matrimony than can be disposed of by broad seals and legal phrases .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 22]: Unfortunately , they were childless , and were thus deprived of the one great bond which unites when others may fail .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 9]: Sir Charles was hurried , if not flurried .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 15]: His boots were muddy and his clothes splashed by the mire of passing vehicles .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 23]: `` I fear I am very late for dinner , '' he said to the footman who took his hat and overcoat .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 11]: `` But I shall not be five minutes in dressing .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 16]: Tell her ladyship -- '' `` Milady is not at home , Sir Charles . ''
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 6]: `` Not at home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 37]: `` Milady went out at half-past five , saying that she was going to Richmond to see Lady Edith Talbot , and that you were not to wait dinner if she was late in returning . ''
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 5]: Sir Charles was surprised .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 22]: He looked steadily at the man as he said : `` Are you quite sure of her ladyship 's orders ? ''
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 8]: `` Quite sure , Sir Charles . ''
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 6]: `` Did she drive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 6]: `` No , Sir Charles .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 12]: She would not order the carriage when I suggested it . ''
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 10]: The baronet , somewhat perplexed , hesitated a moment .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 28]: Then he appeared to dismiss the matter as hardly worth discussion , saying , as he went up stairs : `` Dinner almost immediately , James . ''
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 20]: During the solitary meal he was preoccupied , but ate more than usual , in the butler 's judgment .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 23]: Finding his own company distasteful , he discussed the November Handicap with the butler , and ultimately sent for an evening paper .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 20]: Opening it , the first words that caught his eye were , `` Murder in the West End . ''
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 18]: He read the paragraph , the record of some tragic orgy , and turned to the butler .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 14]: `` A lot of these beastly crimes have occurred recently , Thompson . ''
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 6]: `` Yes , Sir Charles .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 12]: There 's bin three since the beginning of the month . ''
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 4]: After a pause .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 13]: `` Did you hear that her ladyship had gone to Richmond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 7]: `` Yes , Sir Charles . ''
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 9]: `` Do you know how she went ? ''
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 7]: `` No , Sir Charles . ''
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 13]: `` I wanted to see her to-night , _ very _ particularly .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 7]: Order the brougham in ten minutes .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 9]: I am going to the Travellers ' Club .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 16]: I shall be home soon -- say eleven o'clock -- when her ladyship arrives . ''
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 29]: The baronet was driven to and from the club by his own coachman , but on returning to Wensley House was told that his wife was still absent .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 7]: `` No telegram or message ? ''
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 7]: `` No , Sir Charles . ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 25]: `` I suppose she will stay with her sister all night , and I shall have a note in the morning to say so .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 5]: Just like a woman .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 17]: Now if I did that , James , there would be no end of a row .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 8]: Anxiety , and that sort of thing .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 6]: Call me at 8.30 . ''
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 14]: An hour later Sir Charles Dyke left the library and went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 24]: At breakfast next morning the master of the house rapidly scanned the letters near his plate for the expected missive from his wife .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 4]: There was none .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 5]: A maid was waiting .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 8]: He sent her to call the butler .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 17]: `` Look here , Thompson , '' he cried , `` her ladyship has not written .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 9]: Do n't you think I had better wire ?
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 25]: It 's curious , to say the least , going off to Richmond in this fashion , in a beastly fog , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 4]: Thompson was puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 9]: He had examined the letters an hour earlier .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 10]: But he agreed that a telegram was the thing .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 11]: Sir Charles wrote : `` Expected to hear from you .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 7]: Will you be home to lunch ?
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 21]: Want to see you about some hunters '' ; and addressed it to his wife at her sister 's residence .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 14]: `` There , '' he said , turning to his coffee and sole .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 6]: `` That will fetch her .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 10]: We are off to Leicestershire next week , Thompson .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 14]: By the way , I am going to a sale at Tattersall 's .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 14]: Send a groom there with her ladyship 's answer when it comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 17]: He had not been long at the sale yard when a servant arrived with a telegram .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 17]: `` Ah , the post-office people are quick this morning , '' he said , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 15]: He opened the envelope and read : `` Want to see you at once .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 4]: -- DICK . ''
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 19]: He was so surprised by the unexpected nature of the message that he read the words aloud mechanically .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 9]: But he soon understood , and smiled again .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 24]: `` Go back quickly , '' he said to the man , `` and tell Thompson to send along the next telegram . ''
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 44]: A consignment of Waterford hunters was being sold at the time , and the baronet was checking the animals ' descriptions on the catalogue , when he was cheerily addressed : `` Hallo , Dyke , preparing for the shires , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 11]: Wheeling round , the baronet shook hands with Claude Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 20]: `` Yes -- that is , I am looking out for a couple of nice-mannered ones for my wife .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 13]: I have six eating their heads off at Market Harborough now . ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 3]: Bruce hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 9]: `` Will Lady Dyke hunt this season ? ''
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 6]: `` Well , hardly that .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 16]: But she likes to dodge about the lanes with the parson and the doctor . ''
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 22]: `` I only inquired because she told me last night that she would probably winter in the South of France . ''
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 12]: `` Told you -- last night -- South of France ! ''
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 9]: Sir Charles Dyke positively gasped in his amazement .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 5]: `` Why , yes .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 6]: I met her at Victoria .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 14]: She was going to Richmond to see her sister , she said . ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 10]: `` I am jolly glad to hear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 3]: `` Glad !
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 12]: `` Because I have not seen her myself since yesterday morning .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 17]: She went off mysteriously , late in the afternoon , leaving a message with the servants .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 18]: Naturally I am glad to hear from you that she got into the train all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 9]: `` I put her in the carriage myself .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 8]: Have you not heard from her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 13]: I wired this morning , and expect an answer at any moment .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 10]: But what is this about the South of France ?
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 8]: We go to Leicestershire next week . ''
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 9]: `` I ca n't say , of course .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 11]: Your wife seemed to be a little upset about something .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 20]: She only mentioned her intention casually -- in fact , when I asked if we would meet soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 44]: The other laughed , a little oddly in the opinion of his astute observer , and dismissed the matter by the remark that the expected message from his wife would soon clear the slight mystery attending her movements during the past eighteen hours .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 40]: The two men set themselves to the congenial task of criticizing the horses trotting up and down the straw-covered track , and Sir Charles had purchased a nice half-bred animal for forty guineas when his groom again saluted him .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 30]: `` Please , sir , '' said the man , `` here 's another telegram , and Thompson told me to ask if it was the right one . ''
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 28]: Sir Charles frowned at the interruption -- a second horse of a suitable character was even then under the hammer -- but he tore open the envelope .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 21]: At once his agitation became so marked that Bruce cried : `` Good heavens , Dyke , what is it ?
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 8]: No bad news , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 12]: The other , by a strong effort , regained his self-control .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 18]: `` No , no , '' he stammered ; `` it is all right , all right .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 6]: She has gone somewhere else .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 2]: See .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 9]: This is from her sister , Mrs. Talbot .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 14]: Still , I wish Alice would consider my natural anxiety a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 9]: Bruce read : `` I opened your message .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 4]: Alice not here .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 10]: I have not seen her for over a week .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 7]: What do you mean by wire ?
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 7]: Am coming to town at once .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 4]: -- EDITH . ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 19]: The baronet 's pale face and strained voice betrayed the significance of the thought underlying the simple question .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 11]: `` What do you make of it , Claude ? ''
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 8]: Bruce , too , was very grave .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 18]: `` The thing looks queer , '' he said ; `` though the explanation may be trifling .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 7]: Come , I will help you .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 6]: Let us reach your house .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 9]: It is the natural centre for inquiries . ''
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 11]: They hailed a hansom and whirled off to Portman Square .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 6]: They did not say much .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 17]: Each man felt that the affair might not end so happily and satisfactorily as he hoped .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 9]: CHAPTER II INSPECTOR WHITE Lady Dyke had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 52]: Whether dead or alive , and if alive , whether detained by force or absent of her own unfettered volition , this handsome and well-known leader of Society had vanished utterly from the moment when Claude Bruce placed her in a first-class carriage of a Metropolitan Richmond train at Victoria Station .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 32]: At first her husband and relatives hoped against hope that some extraordinary tissue of events had contributed to the building up of a mystery which would prove to be no mystery .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 14]: Yet the days fled , and there was no trace of her whereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 16]: At the outset , the inquiry was confined to the circle of friends and relatives .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 45]: Telegrams and letters in every possible direction suggested by this comparatively restricted field showed conclusively that not only had Lady Dyke not been seen , but no one had the slightest clue to the motives which might induce her to leave her home purposely .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 19]: So far as her distracted husband could ascertain , she did not owe a penny in the world .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 19]: She was a rich woman in her own right , and her banking account was in perfect order .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 47]: She was a woman of the domestic temperament , always in close touch with her family , and those who knew her best scouted the notion of any petty intrigue which would move her , by fear or passion , to abandon all she held dear .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 12]: The stricken baronet confided the search only to his friend Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 17]: He brokenly admitted that he had not sufficiently appreciated his wife while she was with him .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 16]: `` She was of a superior order to me , Claude , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 8]: `` I am hardly a home bird .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 7]: Her ideals were lofty and humanitarian .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 16]: Too often I was out of sympathy with her , and laughed at her notions .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 15]: But , believe me , we never had the shadow of a serious dispute .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 28]: Perhaps I went my own way a little selfishly , but at the time , I thought that she , on her part , was somewhat straight-laced .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 11]: I appreciate her merits when it is too late . ''
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 14]: `` But you must not assume even yet that she is dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 13]: The barrister was certain that some day the mystery would be elucidated .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 4]: `` She is .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 4]: I feel that .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 10]: I shall never see her on earth again . ''
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 7]: `` Oh , nonsense , Dyke .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 11]: Far more remarkable occurrences have been satisfactorily cleared up . ''
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 17]: `` It is very good of you , old chap , to take this cheering view .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 14]: Only , you see , I know my wife 's character so well .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 39]: She would die a hundred times if it were possible rather than cause the misery to her people and myself which , if living , she knows must ensue from this terrible uncertainty as to her fate . ''
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 8]: `` Scotland Yard is still sanguine . ''
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 9]: This good-natured friend was evidently making a conversation .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 5]: `` Oh , naturally .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 21]: But something tells me that my wife is dead , whether by accident or design it is impossible to say .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 24]: The police will cling to the belief that she is in hiding in order to conceal their own inability to find her . ''
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 6]: `` A highly probable theory .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 8]: Are your servants to be trusted ? ''
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 5]: `` Y -- es .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 9]: They have all been with us some years .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 6]: Why do you ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 15]: `` Because I am anxious that nothing of this should get into the papers .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 25]: I have caused paragraphs to be inserted in the fashionable intelligence columns that Lady Dyke has gone to visit some friends in the Midlands .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 21]: For her own sake , if she be living , it is best to choke scandal at its source . ''
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 11]: `` Well , Bruce , I leave everything to you .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 9]: Make such arrangements as you think fit . ''
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 16]: The barrister 's mobile face softened with pity as he looked at his afflicted friend .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 13]: In four days Sir Charles Dyke had aged many years in appearance .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 24]: No one who was acquainted with him in the past would have imagined that the loss of his wife could so affect him .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 23]: `` I have done all that was possible , yet it is very little , '' said Bruce , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 23]: `` You are aware that I am supposed to be an adept at solving curious or criminal investigations of an unusual class .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 51]: But in this case , partly , I suspect , because I myself am the last person who , to our common knowledge , saw Lady Dyke alive on Tuesday night , I am faced by a dead wall of impenetrable fact , through which my intellect can not pierce .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 14]: Yet I am sure that some day this wretched business will be intelligible .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 18]: I will find her if living ; I will find her murderer if she be dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 14]: Not often did Claude Bruce allow his words to so betray his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 32]: Both men were absorbed by the thrilling sensations of the moment , and they were positively startled when a servant suddenly announced : `` Inspector White , of Scotland Yard . ''
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 7]: A short , thick-set man entered .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 8]: He was absolutely round in every part .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 13]: His sturdy , rotund frame was supported on stout , well-moulded legs .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 35]: His bullet head , with close-cropped hair , gave a suggestion of strength to his rounded face , and a pair of small bright eyes looked suspiciously on the world from beneath well-arched eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 22]: Two personalities more dissimilar than those of Claude Bruce and Inspector White could hardly be brought together in the same room .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 26]: People who are fond of tracing resemblances to animals in human beings would liken the one to a grey-hound , the other to a bull-dog .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 28]: Yet they were both masters in the art of detecting crime -- the barrister subtle , analytic , introspective ; the policeman direct , pertinacious , self-confident .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 15]: Bruce lost all interest in a case when the hidden trail was laid bare .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 18]: Mr. White regarded investigation as so many hours on duty until his man was transported or hanged .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 25]: The detective was well acquainted with his unprofessional colleague , and had already met Sir Charles in the early stages of his present quest .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 15]: `` I have an important clue , '' he said , smiling with assurance .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 12]: The baronet was for the moment aroused from his despondent lethargy .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 13]: `` Her ladyship did not go to Richmond on Tuesday night . ''
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 31]: Inspector White did not wait for Bruce to speak , but the barrister nodded with the air of one who knew already that Lady Dyke had not gone to Richmond .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 4]: Mr. White continued .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 24]: `` Thanks to Mr. Bruce 's remembrance of the number of the ticket , we traced it at once in the clearing office .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 16]: It was given up at Sloan Square immediately after the Richmond train passed through . ''
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 4]: Bruce nodded again .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 12]: He was obstinately silent , so the detective questioned him directly .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 12]: `` By this means the inquiry is narrowed to a locality .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 6]: Eh , Mr. Bruce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' said the barrister , turning to poke the fire .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 14]: Mr. White was sure that his acuteness was displeasing to his clever rival .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 30]: He smiled complacently , and went on : `` The ticket-collector remembers her quite well , as the giving up of a Richmond ticket was unusual at this station .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 19]: She passed straight out into the square , and from that point we lost sight of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 8]: `` You do , Mr. White ? ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 3]: said Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 24]: `` Well , sir , it is a great thing to have localized her movements at that hour , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 6]: `` Yes , it is .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 40]: To save time I may tell you that Lady Dyke returned to the station , entered the refreshment room , ordered a glass of wine , which she hardly touched , sat down , and waited some fifteen minutes .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 27]: Then she quitted the room , crossed the square , asked a news-vendor where Raleigh Mansions were , and gave him sixpence for the information . ''
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 5]: His hearers were astounded .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 13]: `` Heavens , Claude , how did you learn all this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 4]: cried the baronet .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 9]: `` Thus far , it was simplicity itself .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 35]: On Wednesday evening when no news could be obtained from your relatives , I started from Victoria , intending to call at every station until I found the place where she left the train .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 11]: The railway clearing officer was too slow , Mr. White .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 23]: Naturally , the hours being identical in the same week , the first ticket-collector I spoke to gave me the desired clue .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 11]: The rest was a mere matter of steady inquiry . ''
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 15]: `` Then you are the man whom the police are now searching for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 5]: blurted out the detective .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 8]: `` From the railway official 's description ?
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 2]: Possibly .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 19]: Pray , Mr. White , let me see the details of my appearance as circulated through the force .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 6]: It would be interesting . ''
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 29]: The inspector was saved from further indiscretions by Sir Charles Dyke 's plaintive question : `` Why did you not tell me these things sooner , Claude ? ''
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 9]: `` What good was there in torturing you ?
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 14]: All that I have ascertained is the A B C of our search .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 14]: We are at a loss for the motive of your wife 's disappearance .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 13]: Victoria , Sloane Square , or Richmond -- does it matter which ?
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 13]: My belief is that she intended to go to Richmond that night .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 17]: Why , otherwise , should she make to the footman and myself the same unvarying statement ?
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 7]: Perhaps she did go there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 8]: `` But these houses , Raleigh Mansions .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 5]: What of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 11]: `` Ah , there we may be forwarded a stage .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 11]: But there are six main entrances and no hall porters .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 16]: There are twelve flats at each number , seventy-two in all , and all occupied .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 34]: That means seventy-two separate inquiries into the history and attributes of a vastly larger number of persons , in order to find some possible connection with Lady Dyke and her purposely concealed visit .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 12]: She may have remained in one of those flats five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 9]: She may be in one of them yet .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 21]: Anyhow , I have taken the necessary steps to obtain the fullest knowledge of the inhabitants of Raleigh Mansions . ''
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 18]: `` Scotland Yard appears to be an unnecessary institution , Mr. Bruce , '' snapped the detective .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 5]: `` By no means .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 13]: It is most useful to me once I have discovered a criminal .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 6]: And it amuses me . ''
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 16]: `` Listen , Claude , and you , Mr. White , '' pleaded the baronet .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 16]: `` I implore you to keep me informed in future of developments in your search .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 11]: The knowledge that progress is being made will sustain me .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 7]: Promise , I ask you . ''
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 10]: `` I promise readily enough , '' answered Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 12]: `` I only stipulate that you prepare yourself for many disappointments .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 21]: Even a highly skilled detective like Inspector White will admit that the failures are more frequent than the successes . ''
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 6]: `` True enough , sir .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 9]: But I must be going , gentlemen . ''
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 30]: Mr. White was determined to work the new vein of Raleigh Mansions thoroughly before even his superiors were aware of its significance in the hunt for her lost ladyship .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 12]: When the detective went out there was silence for some time .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 7]: Dyke was the first to speak .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 16]: `` Have you formed any sort of theory , even a wildly speculative one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 6]: `` No ; none whatever .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 16]: The utter absence of motive is the most puzzling element of the whole situation . ''
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 11]: `` Whom can my wife have known at Raleigh Mansions ?
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 8]: What sort of places are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 9]: `` Quite fashionable , but not too expensive .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 9]: The absence of elevators and doorkeepers cheapens them .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 12]: I am sorry now that I mentioned them to White . ''
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 13]: `` He will disturb every one of the residents by injudicious inquiries .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 32]: Each housemaid who opens a door will be to him a suspicious individual , each butcher 's boy an accomplice , each tenant a principal in the abduction of your wife .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 21]: If I have a theory of any sort , it is that the first reliable news will come from Richmond .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 17]: There can not be the slightest doubt that she was going there on Tuesday night . ''
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 19]: `` It will be very odd if you should prove to be right , '' said Sir Charles .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 23]: Again they were interrupted by the footman , this time the bearer of a telegram , which he handed to his master .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 13]: The latter opened it and read : `` What is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 4]: Are you ill ?
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 5]: I certainly am angry .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 4]: -- DICK . ''
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 17]: He frowned with real annoyance , crumpling up the message and throwing it in the fire .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 13]: `` People bothering one at such a time , '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 6]: Soon afterwards Bruce left him .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 19]: True to the barrister 's prophecy , Inspector White made life miserable to the denizens of Raleigh Mansions .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 16]: He visited them at all hours , and , in some instances , several times .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 54]: Although , in accordance with his instructions , he never mentioned Lady Dyke 's name , he so pestered the occupants with questions concerning a lady of her general appearance that half-a-dozen residents wrote complaining letters to the company which owned the mansions , and the secretary lodged a protest at Scotland Yard .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 23]: Respectable citizens object to detectives prowling about , particularly when they insinuate questions concerning indefinite ladies in tailor-made dresses and fur toques .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 27]: At the end of a week Mr. White was nonplussed , and even Claude Bruce confessed that his more carefully conducted inquiries had yielded no result .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 14]: Towards the end of the month a sensational turn was given to events .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 26]: The body of a woman , terribly disfigured from long immersion in the water and other causes , was found in the Thames at Putney .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 8]: It had been discovered under peculiar circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 37]: A drain pipe emptying into the river beneath the surface was moved by reason of some sanitary alterations , and the workmen intrusted with the task were horrified at finding a corpse tightly wedged beneath it .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 24]: Official examination revealed that although the body had been in the water fully three weeks , the cause of death was not drowning .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 12]: The woman had been murdered beyond a shadow of a doubt .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 28]: A sharp iron spike was driven into her brain with such force that a portion of it had broken off , and remained imbedded in the skull .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 15]: If this were not sufficient , there were other convincing proofs of foul play .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 55]: Although her skirt and coat were of poor quality , her linen was of a class that could only be worn by some one who paid as much for a single under-garment as most women do for a good costume ; but there were no laundry marks , such as usual , upon it .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 24]: On the feet were a pair of strong walking boots , bearing the stamped address of a fashionable boot-maker in the West End .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 23]: Among a list of customers to whom the tradesman supplied footgear of this size and character appeared the name of Lady Dyke .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 29]: Not very convincing testimony , but sufficient to bring Sir Charles to the Putney mortuary in the endeavor to identify the remains as those of his missing wife .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 6]: In this he utterly failed .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 24]: Not only was this poor misshapen lump of distorted humanity wholly unlike Lady Alice , but the color of her hair was different .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 53]: Her ladyship 's maid called to identify the linen -- even the police admitted the outer clothes were not Lady Dyke 's -- was so upset at the repulsive nature of her task that she went into hysterics , protesting loudly that it could not be her mistress she was looking at .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 7]: Bruce differed from both of them .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 27]: He quietly urged Sir Charles to consider the fact that a great many ladies give a helping hand to Nature in the matter of hair tints .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 14]: The chemical action of water would -- The baronet nearly lost his temper .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 16]: `` Really , Bruce , you carry your theories too far , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 9]: `` My wife had none of these vanities .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 8]: I am sure this is not she .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 14]: The mere thought that such a thing could be possible makes me ill .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 8]: Let us get away , quick . ''
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 22]: So a coroner 's jury found an open verdict , and the poor unknown was buried in a pauper 's grave .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 38]: The newspapers dismissed the incident with a couple of paragraphs , though the iron spike planted in the skull afforded good material for a telling headline , and within a couple of days the affair was forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 26]: But Claude Bruce , barrister and amateur detective , was quite sure in his own mind that the nameless woman was Alice , Lady Dyke .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 52]: He was so certain -- though identification of the body was impossible -- that he bitterly resented the scant attention given the matter by the authorities , and he swore solemnly that he would not rest until he had discovered her destroyer and brought the wretch to the bar of justice .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 29]: CHAPTER III THE LADY 'S MAID The first difficulty experienced by the barrister in his self-imposed task was the element of mystery purposely contributed by Lady Dyke herself .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 40]: To a man of his quick perception , sharpened and clarified by his legal training , it was easy to arrive at the positive facts underlying the trivial incidents of his meeting with the missing lady at Victoria Station .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 33]: Briefly stated , his summary was this : Lady Dyke intended to go to Richmond at a later hour than that at which his unexpected presence had caused her to set out .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 54]: She had resolved upon a secret visit to some one who lived in Raleigh Mansions , Sloane Square -- some person whom she knew so slightly as to be unacquainted with the exact address , and , as the result of this visit , she desired subsequently to see her sister at Richmond .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 38]: Sir Charles Dyke was apparently in no way concerned with her movements , nor had she thought fit to consult him , beyond the mere politeness of announcing her probable absence from home at the dinner hour .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 24]: To one of Bruce 's analytical powers the problem would be more simple were it , in a popular sense , more complex .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 31]: In these days , it is a strange thing for a woman of assured position in society to be suddenly spirited out of the world without leaving trace or sign .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 41]: He approached his inquiry with less certainty , owing to Lady Dyke 's own negative admissions , than if she had been swallowed up by an earthquake , and he were asked to determine her fate by inference and deduction .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 31]: It must be remembered that he was sure she was dead -- murdered , and that her body had been lodged by human agents beneath an old drain-pipe at Putney .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 38]: What possible motive could any one have in so foully killing a beautiful , high-minded , and charming woman , whose whole life was known to her associates , whom the breath of scandal had never touched ?
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 31]: The key of the mystery might be found at Raleigh Mansions , but Bruce decided that this branch of his quest could wait until other transient features were cleared up .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 10]: He practically opened the campaign of investigation at Putney .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 52]: Mild weather had permitted the workmen to conclude their operations the day before the barrister reached the spot where the body had been found -- that is to say , some forty-eight hours after he had resolved neither to pause nor deviate in his search until the truth was laid bare .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 31]: A large house , untenanted , occupied the bank , a house with solid front facing the road , and a lawn running from the drawing-room windows to the river .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 38]: Down the right side of the grounds the boundary was sharply marked by a narrow lane , probably a disused ferry road , and access to this thoroughfare was obtained from the lawn by a garden gate .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 38]: A newly marked seam in the roadway showed the line of the drainage work , and Bruce did not glance at the point where the pipe entered the Thames , as the structural features here were recent .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 15]: He went to the office of the contractor who had carried out the alterations .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 8]: An elderly foreman readily answered his questions .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 13]: I was in charge of the men who were on the job .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 6]: It was an easy business .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 9]: Just an outlet for rain from the road .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 23]: An old-fashioned affair ; been there thirty or forty years , I should think ; all the pipes were crumbling away . ''
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 11]: `` Why were the repairs effected at this moment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 13]: `` Well , sir , the house was empty quite a while .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 20]: You see it used to be a school , a place where young gents were prepared for the army .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 19]: It was closed about a year ago , and it is n't everybody as wants so many bedrooms .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 13]: I do hear as how the new tenant has sixteen children . ''
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 10]: `` The incoming people have not yet arrived ? ''
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 6]: `` No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 12]: `` Can you tell me the name of the schoolmaster ? ''
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 16]: When I was younger I have done a lot of carpenter 's work for him .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 8]: He was the Reverend Septimus Childe . ''
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 15]: Bruce made a note of the name , and next sought the local police-inspector .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 24]: `` No , nothing fresh , '' said the latter , in reply to a query concerning the woman `` found drowned . ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 12]: `` I suppose these things are soon lost sight of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 4]: said Bruce casually .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 11]: `` Sometimes they are , and sometimes they are n't .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 13]: It 's wonderful occasionally how a matter gets cleared up after years .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 25]: Of course we keep all the records of a case , so that the affair can be looked into if anything turns up . ''
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 15]: `` Ah , that brings me to the most important object of my visit .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 15]: A small piece of iron was found imbedded in the woman 's skull . ''
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 9]: The inspector smiled as he admitted the fact .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 6]: `` May I see it ?
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 18]: I want either the loan of it for a brief period , or an exact model . ''
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 5]: Again the policeman grinned .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 16]: `` I do n't mind telling you that you are too late , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 4]: `` Too late !
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 5]: How too late ? ''
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 17]: `` It 's been gone to Scotland Yard for the best part of a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 20]: So others besides the barrister thought that the Putney incident required more attention than had been bestowed upon it .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 22]: * * * * * Bruce concluded his round by a visit to the surgeon who gave evidence at the inquest .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 32]: The doctor had no manner of doubt that the woman had been murdered before being placed in the water , the state of the lungs being proof positive on that point .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 16]: `` It was equally indisputable that she was put to death by malice aforethought ? ''
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 19]: A small iron spike was absolutely wedged into the brain through the hardest part of the skull . ''
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 13]: `` What was the nature of the injuries that caused death ? ''
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 33]: `` This piece of iron penetrated the occipital bone at the lowest part , and injured the cerebellum , damaging all the great nerve centres at the base of the brain . ''
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 7]: `` Would death ensue instantly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 14]: Such a blow would have the effect of a high voltage electric current .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 10]: Complete paralysis of the nerve centres means death . ''
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 14]: `` Then I take it that great force must have been used ? ''
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 34]: `` Not so much , perhaps , as the nature of the wound seems to imply ; but considerable -- sufficient , at any rate , to break the piece of iron . ''
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 8]: `` It was broken , you say ?
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 5]: Was it cast-iron ? ''
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 7]: `` Yes , of good quality .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 10]: Off some ornament or design , I should imagine .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 15]: But it snapped off inside the head at the moment of the occurrence . ''
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 23]: `` Curious , is it not , for a person to be killed in such a manner by such an instrument ? ''
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 10]: `` I have never before met such a case .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 41]: Were it not for the way in which the body was jammed beneath a hidden drain-pipe , and the effective means taken to destroy the identity , I should have inclined to the belief that some strange accident had happened .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 28]: At any rate , the murderer must have committed the crime on the spur of the moment , and seized upon the first weapon to hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 11]: `` You say she was forcibly placed where found ? ''
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 13]: `` Yes ; the workmen 's description left no other idea . ''
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 10]: `` Could not the tide have done this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 3]: `` Hardly .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 14]: One can not be quite emphatic , as such odd things do happen .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 45]: But it seems to be almost impossible for the tide at Putney to pack a body beneath a jutting drain-pipe in such a manner that the waist , or narrowest part , should be beneath the pipe and the body remain securely held . ''
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 27]: `` Yet it is not so marvellous as the coincidence that this particular drain should need repairs at the precise period when this tragedy happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 4]: `` Quite so .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 5]: It is exceedingly strange .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 7]: Are you interested in the case ?
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 12]: Have you reason to believe that this poor woman -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 11]: `` I hardly know , '' broke in the barrister .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 21]: `` I have no data to go upon , but I feel convinced that I shall ultimately establish her identity .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 21]: You , doctor , can help me much by telling me your surmises in addition to the known facts . ''
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 30]: The medico looked thoughtfully through the window before he exclaimed : `` I am certain that the woman found in the Thames came from the upper walks of life .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 23]: Notwithstanding the disfiguring effects of the water and rough usage , any medical man can rapidly appreciate the caste of his subject .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 31]: She was , I should say , a woman of wealth and refinement , one who led an orderly , well-regulated life , whose surroundings were normal and healthy . ''
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 10]: Bruce thanked his informant and hurried back to London .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 8]: A telegram to Inspector White preceded him .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 14]: He had not long reached his Victoria-street chambers when the detective was announced .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 7]: He soon made known his wishes .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 26]: `` I want you to give me that small piece of iron found in the head of the woman at Putney , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 13]: `` If necessary , I will return it in twenty-four hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 11]: Mr. White 's face showed some little sign of annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 17]: `` It is against the rules , '' he began ; but Bruce curtly interrupted him .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 14]: `` Very well , I will make direct application to the Commissioner . ''
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 29]: `` I was going to say , Mr. Bruce , that although not strictly in accordance with orders , I will make an exception in your case . ''
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 16]: And the detective slowly produced the _ piece de conviction _ from a large pocket-book .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 27]: In sober fact , the police officer was somewhat jealous of the clever lawyer , who saw so quickly through complexities that puzzled his slower brain .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 35]: He was in nowise anxious to help the barrister in his inquiries , though keenly wishful to benefit by his discoveries , and follow out his theories when they were defined with sufficient clearness .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 10]: Bruce did not at first take the proffered article .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 12]: `` Let me understand , Mr. White , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 11]: `` Do you object to my presence in this inquiry ?
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 10]: Are you going to hinder me or help me ?
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 15]: It will save much future misunderstanding if we have this point settled now . ''
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 8]: The detective flushed at this direct inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 11]: `` I will be candid with you , Mr. Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 21]: It is true I have been vexed at times when you have overreached me ; but I regret it immediately .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 14]: It is foolish of me to try and solve problems by your methods .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 17]: Kindly forget my momentary disinclination to hand over the only genuine link in the case . ''
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 6]: `` In what case ? ''
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 11]: `` In the case of Lady Dyke 's disappearance . ''
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 17]: Then you think it is in some way connected with the woman found at Putney ? ''
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 7]: `` I am sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 24]: The woman at Putney , whether Lady Dyke herself or not I can not tell , wore some of her ladyship 's clothes .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 33]: When we have ascertained the means and the manner of the death of the woman buried at Putney we shall not be far from learning what has become of Lady Dyke . ''
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 9]: `` How have you identified the clothes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 20]: `` I managed to gain the confidence of the lady 's maid , who gave evidence at the inquest .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 37]: She , of course , is quite positive that the body was not that of her mistress , but when I had examined some of Lady Dyke 's linen I no longer doubted the fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 22]: `` If you knew all this , how comes it that more did not transpire at the coroner 's inquiry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 14]: `` In such affairs an inquest is rather a hindrance to the police .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 21]: It is better to lull the guilty person or persons into the belief that the crime has passed into oblivion .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 15]: They know as well as we do that Lady Dyke is buried at Putney .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 16]: We have failed to establish her identity by the evidence of the husband and servants .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 36]: The linen and clothes , our sole effective testimony , remain in our possession ; so , taking everything into consideration , I prefer that matters should remain as they are for the present . ''
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 10]: `` Really , Mr. White , I congratulate you .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 22]: You will perhaps pardon me for saying that some of your colleagues do not usually take so sensible a view . ''
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 7]: The policeman smiled at the compliment .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 14]: `` I am learning your method , Mr. Bruce , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 14]: As he spoke , Smith entered with a note endorsed `` Urgent . ''
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 39]: It was in the handwriting of Sir Charles Dyke , and even the imperturbable barrister could not resist an exclamation of amazement when he read : `` MY DEAR BRUCE , -- My wife 's maid has vanished .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 11]: She has not been near the house for three days .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 13]: The thing came to my ears owing to gossip amongst the servants .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 8]: There is something maddening about these occurrences .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 8]: I really can not stand any more .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 13]: Do come to see me , there 's a good fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 8]: `` Well , I 'm jiggered ! ''
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 4]: said the detective .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 17]: `` The blessed girl must have been spirited away a few hours after I saw her .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 10]: Maybe , Mr. Bruce , we are all wrong .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 9]: Has she gone to join her mistress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 9]: `` Possibly -- in the next world . ''
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 16]: Nothing would shake the barrister 's belief that Alice , Lady Dyke , was dead .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 17]: CHAPTER IV NO. 61 RALEIGH MANSIONS Really , the maid deserved to have her ears pulled .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 12]: People in her walk in life should not ape their betters .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 21]: Lady Dyke , owing to her position , was entitled to some degree of oddity or mystery in her behavior .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 22]: But for a lady 's maid to so upset the entire household at Wensley House , Portman Square , was intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 50]: Sir Charles became , if possible , more miserable ; the butler fumed ; the housekeeper said that the girl was always a forward minx , and the footman winked at Buttons , as much as to say that he knew a good deal if he liked to talk .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 15]: The police were as greatly baffled by this latter incident as by its predecessor .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 9]: The movements of the maid were quite unknown .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 11]: No one could tell definitely when she left the house .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 50]: Her fellow-servants described the dress she probably wore , as all her other belongings were in her bedroom ; but beyond the fact that her name was Jane Harding , and that she had not returned to her home in Lincolnshire , the police could find no further clue .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 17]: So , in brief , Jane Harding quickly joined Lady Dyke in the limbo of forgetfulness .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 7]: Bruce , however , forgot nothing .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 9]: Indeed , he rejoiced at this new development .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 19]: `` The greater the apparent mystery , '' he communed , `` the less it is in reality .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 8]: We now have two tracks to follow .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 23]: They are both hidden , it is true , but when we find one , it will probably intersect the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 27]: The new year was a few days old when Bruce made his first step through the bewildering maze which seemed to bar progress on every side .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 30]: He received a report from the man , a pensioned police-officer , who had conducted a painstaking search into the history and occupation of every inhabitant of Raleigh Mansions .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 10]: Two items the barrister fastened on to at once .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 31]: `` At No. 12 , top floor right , entrance by first door on Sloane Square side , is a small flat occupied by a man named Sydney H. Corbett .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 19]: He passes as an American , but is probably an Englishman who has resided in the United States .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 16]: He does not mix with other Americans in London , and is of irregular habits .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 29]: He frequents race meetings and sporting clubs , is reported to belong to a Piccadilly club where high play is the rule , and has no definite occupation .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 21]: He occasionally visits a lady who lives at No. 61 , same mansions , ground floor , and sixth door .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 18]: They have been heard to quarrel seriously , and the dispute appears always to have concerned money .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 9]: Corbett went to Monte Carlo early in December .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 29]: His address there is ` Hotel du Cercle , ' and the local post-office has a supply of stamped and addressed envelopes in which to forward his correspondence .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 14]: `` At No. 61 , as already described , resides Mrs. Gwendoline Hillmer .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 27]: She lives in good style , rents a brougham and a victoria , and is either a wealthy widow or maintained by some one of means .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 21]: She dresses well , and goes out a good deal to theatres , but otherwise leads a rather lonely life .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 32]: Her most frequent visitor is , or was , a gentleman who looked like an officer in the Guards , and , much less often , the aforesaid Sydney H. Corbett .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 10]: Her servants , except the maid , live out .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 30]: The maid , who is a sort of companion , is talkative , but does not know much , or , if she does , will not speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 7]: Bruce weighed these statements very carefully .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 46]: They did not contain any positive facts that promised well for the elucidation of Lady Dyke 's visit to the mansions on that fateful November evening , but the absolute colorlessness of the reports concerning the other occupants rendered them quite impossible of individual distinction .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 16]: After an hour of puzzled thought the barrister finally decided upon a course of action .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 17]: He would see Mrs. Gwendoline Hillmer , and trust to luck in the way of discoveries .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 39]: A quiet smile lit up his handsome , regular features as he proceeded to array himself in the most fashionable clothes he possessed , paying the utmost attention to every detail in a manner that amazed his valet .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 26]: When at last that worthy was despatched to the nearest florist 's for a _ boutonniere _ , he communicated his bewilderment to the hall-porter .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 17]: `` My guv ` nor 's going out on the mash , '' he said confidentially .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 23]: `` I thought he would never look at a woman ; but , bless you , Jim , we 're all alike .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 12]: When the day comes we all rush after a petticoat . ''
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 12]: It was nearly six o'clock when Bruce walked down Victoria Street .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 34]: For some reason , he did not call a hansom , and it was almost with a start that he found himself purchasing a ticket to Sloane Square at the Underground Railway office .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 15]: At this precise hour and place he had last seen Lady Alice on earth .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 8]: The memory nerved him to his purpose .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 15]: A few minutes later he pressed the electric bell of No. 61 Raleigh Mansions .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 22]: As he listened to the slight jar of the indicator within , he smiled at the apparent fatuity of his mission .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 34]: He had one card , perhaps a weak one , to play , it was true , but he hoped that circumstances might prevent this from being tabled too early in the game .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 25]: The door opened , and a youthful housemaid stood before him , the simple wonder in her eyes showing that such visitors were rare .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 8]: `` Is Mrs. Hillmer at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 14]: `` I 'll see sir , if you give me your name . ''
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 13]: `` Surely you know whether or not she is at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 10]: The girl stammered and blushed at this unexpected query .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 27]: `` Well , sir , '' she said , `` my mistress is in , but I do not know if she can receive any one .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 8]: She is dressed to go out . ''
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 4]: that 's better .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 24]: Now , take her my card , and say that while I will not detain her , my business is very important . ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 15]: This with a sweet smile that put the flurried maid entirely at her ease .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 28]: The girl withdrew , after hesitating for a moment to decide the important question as to whether or not she should close the door in his face .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 8]: Another smile , and she did not .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 30]: He was thus free to note the luxurious and tasteful air of the general appointments , for the entrance hall usually reveals much of the characteristics of the inmates .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 9]: Here was every evidence of refinement and wealth .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 11]: All the display had not been lavished on the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 34]: As he waited , conscious of the fact that his colloquy with the servant had been overheard , a lady crossed from one room to the other at the end of the passage .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 42]: Her smart but simple dress , and the quick scrutiny she gave him , as though discovering his presence accidentally , caused him to believe -- rightly , as it transpired -- that this was the maid-companion described by his assistant .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 30]: Not only had she obviously made her appearance in order to look at him , but the housemaid had carried his message to a different section of the flat .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 4]: The girl returned .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 15]: `` My mistress will see you in a few minutes , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 10]: `` Will you kindly step into the dining-room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 30]: He followed her , sat down in a position where the strong glare of the electric lamps would fall on any one who stood opposite , and waited developments .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 23]: The furniture was solid and appropriate , the carpet rich , and the pictures , engravings for the most part , excellent .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 21]: This pleasant room , warmed by a cheerful fire , impressed Bruce as a place much used by the household .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 19]: Books and work-baskets were scattered about , and a piano , littered with music , filled a corner .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 26]: There were a few photographs of persons and places , but he had not time to examine these before the lady of the house entered .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 17]: Her appearance , for some reason inexplicable to the barrister himself , took him by surprise .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 18]: She was tall , graceful , extremely good-looking , and dressed in a style of quiet elegance .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 48]: Just the sort of woman one would expect to find in such a well-appointed abode , yet more refined in manner than Bruce , from his knowledge of the world , thought he would meet , judging by the hasty inferences drawn from his subordinate 's report .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 6]: She was self-possessed , too .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 23]: With calm tone , and slightly elevated eyebrows , she said : `` You wish to see me , I understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 15]: Allow me first to apologize for the hour at which I have called . ''
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 6]: `` No apology is necessary .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 6]: But I am going out .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 17]: Perhaps you will be good enough not to detain me longer than is absolutely necessary . ''
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 9]: She stood between the table and the door .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 18]: Bruce , who had risen at her entrance , was at the other side of the room .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 19]: Her words , no less than her attitude , showed that she desired the interview to be brief .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 13]: But the barrister resolved that he would not be repelled so coolly .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 28]: Advancing , with a bow and that fascinating smile of his , he said , pulling forward a chair : `` Wo n't you be seated ? ''
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 6]: The lady looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 12]: She saw a man of fine physique and undoubted good breeding .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 3]: She hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 15]: There was no reason to be rude to him , so she sat down .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 32]: Claude drew a chair to the other side of the hearthrug , and commenced : `` I have ventured to seek this interview for the purpose of making some inquiries . ''
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 5]: `` I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 6]: Are you a policeman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 24]: The words were blurted out impetuously , a trifle complainingly , but Bruce gave no sign of the interest they had for him .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 10]: `` Good gracious , no , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 8]: `` Why should you think that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 28]: `` Because two detectives have been bothering me , and every other person in these mansions , about some mysterious lady who called here two months ago .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 26]: They do n't know where she called , nor will they state her name ; as if any one could possibly know anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 12]: So I naturally thought you were on the same errand . ''
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 12]: `` Confound that rascal White , '' growled he to himself .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 24]: But Mrs. Hillmer went on : `` If that is not your business , would you mind telling me what it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 15]: Now Bruce 's alert brain had been actively engaged during the last few seconds .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 16]: This woman was not the clever , specious adventuress he had half expected to meet .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 24]: It seemed more than ever unlikely that she could have any knowledge of Lady Dyke or the causes that led to her disappearance .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 12]: He was tempted to frame some excuse and take his departure .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 32]: But the certainty that his missing friend had visited Raleigh Mansions , and the necessity there was for exploiting every line of inquiry , impelled him to adopt this last resource .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 23]: `` It is not concerning a missing lady , but concerning a missing gentleman that I have come to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 5]: The shot went home .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 23]: Why , for the life of him , he could not tell , but his companion was manifestly disturbed at his words .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 7]: `` Oh , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 15]: Then , after a little pause : `` May I ask his name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 10]: He is known as Mr. Sydney H. Corbett . ''
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 6]: She gave a slight gasp .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 10]: `` Why do you put it in that way ?
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 8]: Is not that his right name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 11]: `` I have reason to believe it is not . ''
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 19]: Mrs. Hillmer was so obviously distressed that Bruce inwardly reviled himself for causing her so much unnecessary suffering .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 18]: In all probability , the source of her emotion had not the remotest bearing upon his quest .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 33]: Then came the pertinent query , after a glance at his card , which she still held in her hand : `` Who are you , Mr. -- Mr. Claude Bruce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 14]: `` I am a member of the Bar , of the Inner Temple .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 17]: My chambers are No. 7 Paper Buildings , and my private residence is given there . ''
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 12]: `` And why are you interested in Mr. Sydney Corbett ? ''
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 17]: `` Ah , in that respect I am at this moment unable to enlighten you . ''
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 7]: `` Unable , or unwilling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 32]: He indulged in a quiet piece of fencing : `` Really , Mrs. Hillmer , '' he said , `` I am not here as in any sense hostile to you .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 22]: I merely want some detailed information with regard to this gentleman , information which you may be able to give me .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 5]: That is all . ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 39]: All this time he knew that the woman was scrutinizing him narrowly -- trying to weigh him up as it were , not because she feared him , but rather to discover the true motive of his presence .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 15]: Personally , he had never faced a more difficult task than this make-believe investigation .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 43]: He could have laughed at the apparent want of connection between Lady Dyke 's ill-fated visit to Raleigh Mansions and this worrying of a beautiful , pleasant-mannered woman , who was surely neither a principal nor an accomplice in a ghastly crime .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 15]: `` Well , I suppose I may consider myself in the hands of counsel .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 11]: Tell me what it is you want to know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 16]: Mrs. Hillmer pouted , with the air of a child about to undergo a scolding .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 12]: `` Are you acquainted with Mr. Corbett 's present address ? ''
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 15]: I have neither seen him nor heard from him since early in November . ''
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 11]: `` Can you be more precise about the period ? ''
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 6]: `` Yes , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 30]: She arose , took from a drawer in the sideboard a packet of bills -- receipted , he observed -- searched through them and found the document she sought .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 25]: `` I purchased a few articles about that time , '' she explained , `` and the account for them is dated November 15 .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 21]: I had not seen my -- '' She blushed , became confused , laughed a little , and went on .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 23]: `` I had not seen Mr. Corbett for at least a week before that date -- say November 8th or 9th . ''
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 10]: Lady Dyke disappeared on the evening of the 6th !
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 28]: Bruce swallowed his astonishment at the odd coincidence of dates , for he said , with an encouraging laugh , `` Out with it , Mrs. Hillmer .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 14]: You were about to describe Mr. Corbett correctly when you recollected yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 36]: Mrs. Hillmer , still coloring and becoming saucily cheerful , cried , `` Why should I trouble myself when you , of course , know all that I can tell you , and probably more ?
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 16]: He is my brother , and a pretty tiresome sort of relation , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 8]: `` I am obliged for your confidence .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 20]: In return , I am free to state that your brother is now in the South of France . ''
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 23]: `` As you are here , Mr. Bruce , '' she said , `` I may as well get some advice gratis .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 10]: Can people writ him in the South of France ?
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 10]: Can they ask me to pay his debts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 9]: `` Under ordinary circumstances they can do neither .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 6]: Certainly not the latter . ''
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 5]: `` I hope not .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 17]: But they sometimes come very near to it , as I know to my cost . ''
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 3]: How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 4]: Mrs. Hillmer hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 27]: Her smile was a trifle scornful , and her color rose again as she answered : `` People are not averse to taking advantage of circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 12]: I have had some experience of this trait in debt-collectors already .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 6]: But they must be careful .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 26]: You , as a legal man , must know that demands urged on account of personal reasons may come very near to levying blackmail . ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 16]: `` Surely , Mrs. Hillmer , you do not suspect me of being a dun .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 4]: Perish the thought !
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 10]: You could never be in debt to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 6]: `` Very nice of you .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 13]: Do n't you represent those people on Leadenhall Street , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 5]: `` What people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 15]: `` Messrs. Dodge & Co. '' `` No ; why do you ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 16]: `` Because my brother entered into what he called a ` deal ' with them .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 39]: He underwrote some shares in a South African mine , as a nominal affair , he told me , and now they want him to pay for them because the company is not supported by the public . ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 18]: `` No , I do not represent Dodge & Co. '' `` Is there something else then ?
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 6]: Whom do you represent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 22]: `` To be as precise as permissible , I may say that my inquiries in no sense affect financial matters . ''
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 5]: `` What then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 12]: `` Well , there is a woman in the case . ''
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 9]: Mrs. Hillmer was evidently both relieved and interested .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 12]: `` No , you do n't say , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 7]: `` Tell me all about it .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 14]: I never knew Bertie to be much taken up with the fair sex .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 5]: I am all curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 5]: Who is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 19]: He did not take advantage of the mention of a name which in no way stood for Sydney .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 9]: Besides , perhaps the initial stood for Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 7]: He resolved to try another tack .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 14]: Glancing at his watch he said : `` It is nearly seven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 9]: I have already detained you an unconscionable time .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 5]: You were going out .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 15]: Permit me to call again , and we can discuss matters at leisure . ''
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 17]: He rose , and the lady sighed : `` You were just beginning to be entertaining .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 10]: I was only going to dine at a restaurant .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 9]: I am quite tired of being alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 5]: Was it a hint ?
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 4]: He would see .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 13]: `` Are you dining by yourself , then , Mrs. Hillmer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 5]: `` I hardly know .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 7]: I may bring my maid . ''
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 7]: Claude now made up his mind .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 43]: `` May I venture , '' he said , `` after such an informal introduction , to ask you to dine with me at the Prince 's Restaurant , and afterwards , perhaps , to look in at the Jollity Theatre ? ''
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 6]: The lady was unfeignedly pleased .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 34]: She arranged to call for him in her brougham within twenty minutes , and Bruce hurried off to Victoria Street in a hansom to dress for this unexpected branch of the detective business .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 28]: When he told his valet to telephone to the restaurant and the theatre respectively for a reserved table and a couple of stalls , that worthy chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 19]: When his master entered a brougham in which was seated a fur-wrapped lady , the valet grinned broadly .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 9]: `` I knew it , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 10]: `` The guv ` nor 's on the mash .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 12]: Now , who would ever have thought it of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 26]: CHAPTER V AT THE JOLLITY THEATRE By tacit consent , Claude and his fair companion dropped for the hour the rôles of inquisitor and witness .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 41]: They were both excellent talkers , they were mutually interested , and there was in their present escapade a spice of that romance not so lacking in the humdrum life of London as is generally supposed to be the case .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 21]: Bruce did not ask himself what tangible result he expected from this quaint outcome of his visit to Sloane Square .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 6]: It was too soon yet .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 15]: He must trust to the vagaries of chance to elucidate many things now hidden .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 27]: Meanwhile a good dinner , a bright theatre , and the society of a smart , nice-looking woman , were more than tolerable substitutes for progress .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 44]: As a partial explanation of his somewhat eccentric behavior , he volunteered a lively account of a recent _ cause celebre _ , in which he had taken a part , but the details of which had been rigidly kept from the public .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 36]: He more than hinted that Mr. Sydney Corbett had figured prominently in the affair ; and Mrs. Hillmer laughed with unrestrained mirth at the unwonted appearance of her brother in the character of a Lothario .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 35]: `` Tell me , '' said Bruce confidentially , when a couple of glasses of Moët '89 had consolidated friendly relations , `` what sort of a fellow is this brother of yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 14]: `` Not in any sense a bad boy , but a trifle wild .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 21]: He will not live an ordinary life , and at times he has been hard pressed to live at all .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 30]: As a matter of fact , it is this scrape he blundered into with Messrs. Dodge & Co. that induced him to masquerade temporarily under an assumed name . ''
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 9]: `` Then what is his real name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 10]: `` Ah , now you are pumping me again .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 6]: I refuse to tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 17]: `` But there are generally serious reasons when a man disguises himself in such fashion . ''
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 22]: `` The reason he gave me was that he dreaded being writted for liability regarding the shares I mentioned to you .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 5]: It was good enough .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 14]: Now you come with this story of meddling with somebody else 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 7]: Surely this is an additional reason .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 19]: I supplied him with funds until we quarrelled , and then he went off in a huff . ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 8]: `` What did you quarrel about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 7]: `` That concerns me only . ''
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 11]: Mrs. Hillmer was so emphatic that Bruce dropped the subject .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 37]: When they drove to the theatre Mrs. Hillmer , on alighting at the entrance , said to her coachman , `` You may return home now , and bring Dobson to meet me at 11.15 . ''
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 11]: `` May I venture to inquire who Dobson is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 3]: said Claude .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 6]: Dobson is my maid . ''
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 11]: This woman puzzled him the more he saw of her .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 14]: He was now quite positive that she lived on the fringe of Society .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 10]: Her status was , at the best , dubious .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 15]: Yet he had never heard of her before , nor met her in public .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 28]: None of his friends were known to her , and she mentioned no one beyond those popular personages who are _ connu _ of all the world .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 15]: She was obviously wealthy and refined , with more than a spice of unconventionality .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 22]: At times , too , beneath her habitual expressions of lively and vivacious interest , there was a touch of melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 38]: For an instant her face grew sad when her eyes rested on a typical family party of father , mother , and two girls who occupied seats in the row of stalls directly in front of her .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 10]: For some reason Bruce felt sorry for Mrs. Hillmer .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 50]: He regretted that the exigencies of his quest forced him to make her his dupe , and he resolved that , if by any chance her scapegrace brother were concerned in Lady Dyke 's death , Mrs. Hillmer should , if possible , be spared personal humiliation or disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 39]: Indeed , he had formed such a favorable opinion of her that he had made up his mind to conduct his future investigations without causing her to assist involuntarily in putting a halter around her relative 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 22]: Nevertheless , it was impossible to avoid getting some further information , as the lady herself paved the way for it .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 29]: Her comments betrayed such an accurate acquaintance with the technique of the stage that he said to her , `` You must have acted a good deal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 12]: `` No , '' she said , `` not very much .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 9]: But I was stage struck when young . ''
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 10]: `` But you have not appeared in public ? ''
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 8]: `` Yes , some six years ago .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 18]: I worked so hard that I fell ill , and then -- then I got married . ''
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 12]: `` Do you go out much to theatres , nowadays ? ''
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 4]: `` Very little .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 16]: It is lonely by oneself , and there are so few plays worth seeing . ''
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 14]: Bruce wondered why she insisted so strongly upon the isolation of her existence .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 33]: In his new-found sympathy he forebore to question , and she continued : `` When I do visit a theatre I amuse myself mostly by silent criticism of the actors and actresses .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 23]: Not that I could do better than many of them , or half so well , but it passes the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 15]: `` I hope you do not regard killing time as your main occupation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 16]: `` It is so , I fear , however hard I may strive otherwise . ''
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 11]: And again that shadow of regret darkened the fair face .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 48]: Some one in front turned round and glared at them angrily , for the famous comedian , Mr. Prospect Ricks , was singing his deservedly famous song , `` It was all because I buttoned up her boots , '' so the conversation dropped for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 8]: Claude focussed his opera-glasses on the stage .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 27]: While his eyes wandered idly over the pretty faces and shapely limbs of the coryphées his brain was busy piecing together all that he had heard .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 35]: The odd coincidence of the dates of Lady Dyke 's murder and the speedy departure of the self-styled Sydney Corbett for the Riviera would require a good deal of explanation by the latter gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 14]: True , it was not the barrister 's habit to jump at conclusions .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 11]: There might be a perfectly valid motive for the journey .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 22]: If the man did not desire his whereabouts to be known , why did he leave his address at the post-office ?
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 24]: And , then , what possible reason could Lady Dyke have in visiting him voluntarily and secretly at his chambers in Raleigh Mansions ?
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 28]: This virtuous and high-principled lady could have nothing in common with a careless adventurer , taking the most lenient view of his sister 's description of him .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 28]: And as Bruce 's subtle brain strove vainly to match the queer fragments of the puzzle , his keen eyes roved over the stage in aimless activity .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 4]: Suddenly they paused .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 30]: His power of vision and mental analysis were alike inadequate to the new and startling fact which had obtruded itself , unasked and unsought for , upon his sight .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 49]: Among the least prominent of the chorus girls , posturing and moving with the stiffness and visible anxiety of the novice , who is not yet accustomed to the glare of the footlights upon undraped limbs , was one in whose every gesture Bruce took an absorbing interest .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 34]: He was endowed in full measure with that prime requisite in the detection of criminals , an unusually good memory for faces , together with the artistic faculty of catching the true expression .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 50]: Hence it was that , after the whirl of a dancing chorus had for a few seconds brought this particular member of the company close to the proscenium , Bruce became quite sure of having developed at least one branch of his inquiry within measurable distance of its conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 14]: The girl on the stage was Jane Harding , Lady Dyke 's maid .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 16]: When her features first flashed upon his conscious gaze he could hardly credit the discovery .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 12]: But each instant of prolonged scrutiny placed the fact beyond doubt .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 38]: Not even the make-up and the elaborate wig could conceal the contour of her pretty if insipid face , and a slight trick she had of drooping the left eyelid when thinking confirmed him in his belief .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 36]: So astounded was he at this sequel to his visit to the theatre , that he utilized every opportunity of a full stage to examine still further the appearance and style of this strange apparition .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 22]: When the curtain fell and Jane Harding had vanished , he was brought back to actuality by Mrs. Hillmer 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 6]: `` Fie , Mr. Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 16]: You are taking altogether too much notice of one of the fair ladies in front .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 5]: Which one is it ?
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 14]: The tall standard bearer or the little girl who pirouettes so gracefully ? ''
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 7]: `` Neither , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 23]: I was taken up by wondering how a young woman manages to secure employment in a theatre for the first time . ''
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 8]: `` I think I can tell you .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 6]: Influence goes a long way .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 4]: Talent occasionally counts .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 42]: Then , a well-known agent may , for a nominal fee , get an opening for a handsome , well-built girl who has taken lessons from either himself or some of his friends in dancing or singing , or both . ''
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 12]: `` Is such a thing possible for a domestic servant ? ''
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 13]: `` It all depends upon the domestic servant 's circle of acquaintances .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 9]: As a rule , I should say not .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 12]: A theatre like this requires a higher average of intelligence . ''
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 33]: This , and more , Bruce well knew , but he was only making conversation , while he thought intently , almost fiercely , upon the latest phase of his strange quest .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 12]: During the third act he devoted more time to Mrs. Hillmer .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 43]: If that sprightly dame were a little astonished at the celerity with which he conducted her to her carriage and the waiting Dobson , it was banished by the nice way in which he thanked her for the pleasure she had conferred .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 24]: `` The enjoyment has been mostly on my side , '' she cried , as he stood near the window of her brougham .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 9]: `` Come to see me again soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 25]: He bowed , and would have said something if an imperious policeman had not ordered the coachman to make way for the next vehicle .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 9]: So Mrs. Hillmer was whisked into the traffic .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 51]: From force of habit , he glanced casually at the crowd struggling through the exit of the theatre , and he caught sight of Mr. White , who , too late , averted his round eyes and strove to shield his portly form in the portico of a neighboring restaurant .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 13]: He did not want to be bothered by the detective just then .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 31]: He lit a cigarette , and Mr. White slid off quietly into the stream of traffic , finally crossing the road and jumping on to a Charing Cross ` bus .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 22]: `` So , '' said Claude to himself , `` White has been watching Raleigh Mansions , and watching me too .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 17]: ` Pon my honor , I should n't wonder if he suspected me of the murder !
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 9]: I 'm glad I saw him just now .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 16]: For the next couple of hours I wish to be free from his interference . ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 44]: Waiting a few moments to make sure that White had not detailed an aide-de-camp to continue the surveillance , he buttoned his overcoat to the chin , tilted his hat forward , and strolled round to the stage door of the Jollity Theatre .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 35]: CHAPTER VI MISS MARIE LE MARCHANT The uncertain rays of a weak lamp , struggling through panes dulled by dirt and black letters , cast a fitful light about the precincts of the stage-door .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 38]: Elderly women and broken-down men , slovenly and unkempt , kept furtive guard over the exit , waiting for the particular `` super '' to come forth who would propose the expected adjournment to a favorite public-house .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 77]: Some smart broughams , a four-wheeler , and a few hansoms , formed a close line along the pavement , which was soon crowded with the hundred odd hangers-on of a theatre -- scene-shifters , gasmen , limelight men , members of the orchestra , dressers , and attendants -- mingling with the small stream of artistes constantly pouring out into the cold night after a casual inquiry for letters at the office of the doorkeeper .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 35]: This being a fashionable place of amusement there were not wanting several representatives of the gilded youth , some obviously ginger-bread or `` unleavened '' imitations , others callow specimens of the genuine article .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 26]: Bruce paid little heed to them as they impudently peered beneath each broad-leafed and high-feathered hat to discover the charmer honored by their chivalrous attentions .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 23]: Yet the presence of this brigade of light-headed cavaliers helped the barrister far more than he could have foreseen or even hoped .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 18]: At last the ex-lady 's maid appeared , dressed in a showy winter costume and jaunty toque .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 28]: She was on very friendly terms with two older girls , on whom the stage had set its ineffaceable seal , and the reason was soon apparent .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 45]: `` Come along , '' she cried , her words being evidently intended to have an effect on others in the throng less favored than those whom she addressed ; `` let us get into a hansom and go to Scott 's for supper .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 5]: Here , cabby ! ''
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 32]: She was on the step of a hansom when a tall , good-looking boy , faultlessly dressed , and with something of Sandhurst or Woolwich in his carriage , darted forward .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 16]: `` Hello , Millie , '' he said to one of Jane Harding 's companions .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 5]: `` How are you ?
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 13]: A couple of fellows have come up with me for the night .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 30]: Let 's all go and have something to eat at the Duke 's , '' thereby indicating a well-known club usually patronized by higher class artistes than this trio .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 34]: After a series of introductions by Christian names , among which Bruce failed to catch the word `` Jane , '' the party went off in three hansoms , a pair in each .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 19]: Claude was not a member of the `` Duke 's , '' though he had often been there .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 25]: But there was a man close at hand who was a member of everything in London that in any way pertained to things theatrical .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 12]: Every one knew Billy Sadler and Billy Sadler knew every one .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 52]: A brief run in a cab to a theatre , a restaurant , and another restaurant , revealed the large-hearted Billy , drinking a whisky and soda and relating to a friend , with great gusto and much gesticulation , the very latest quarrel between the stage-manager and the leading lady .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 7]: He hailed Claude with enthusiasm . ''
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 18]: ` Pon my soul , Bruce , old chap , have n't seen you for an age .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 5]: Where have you bin ?
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 10]: An ' what 's the little game now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 14]: Mr. Sadler was fully aware of the barrister 's penchant for investigating mysteries .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 9]: The two had often foregathered in the past .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 8]: `` Are you ` busy ' '' ?
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 3]: said Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 5]: `` Not a bit .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 4]: By-bye , Jack .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 9]: See you at luncheon to-morrow at the Gorgonzola .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 7]: Well , what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 15]: `` I want you to come with me to the ` Duke 's . '
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 12]: There 's a young lady there I 'm interested in . ''
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 18]: Billy squeezed round in the hansom , which was now bowling across a corner of Trafalgar Square .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 7]: `` You , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 5]: `` After a girl !
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 6]: Is she in the profession ?
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 7]: Is mamma frightened about her angel ?
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 18]: The correct figure for a breach just now , my boy , is five thou ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 8]: `` Oh , it 's nothing serious .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 14]: I will tell you all about it when matters have cleared a bit .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 11]: It is a mere item in a really big story .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 6]: But , here we are .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 8]: Take me straight to the supper-room . ''
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 56]: As they entered the comfortable , brightly lit club the strains of a band came pleasantly to their ears , and in a minute they were installed at a corner table in the splendid room devoted to the most cheery of all gatherings -- a Bohemian meal when the labors of the night are past .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 6]: Bruce soon marked his quarry .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 18]: Jane Harding was in great form -- eating , drinking , and talking at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 8]: `` Who is that , Billy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 7]: he said , indicating the girl .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 21]: Sadler carefully balanced his _ pince-nez _ on his well-defined nose , gazed , and laughed : `` Goodness knows .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 12]: She 's a new-comer , and not much at the best .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 10]: Do you know where she carries a banner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 6]: `` At the Jollity . ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 17]: then here 's our man '' -- for a Mephistophelian gentleman was passing at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 14]: `` Say , Rosenheim , who 's the new coryphée over there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 11]: Mephistopheles halted , looked at Jane and laughed , too .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 34]: `` Her name is Miss Marie le Marchant ; but as she happened to be born in London she pronounces it Mahrie Lee Mahshuns , with the accent on the ` Mahs . '
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 9]: Anything else you would like to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 9]: `` Yes , I 'm stuck on her !
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 8]: Where did you pick her up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 12]: `` She 's a housemaid , or something of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 4]: Came into money .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 8]: Wants to knock 'em on the stige .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 6]: The rest is easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 9]: `` Has she been with you long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 14]: put in Claude , as their informant was the under-manager of the Jollity .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 6]: Mr. Rosenheim glanced at him .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 27]: Sadler , he knew , had no interest in the girl , and the barrister did not quite possess the juvenile appearance that warranted such solicitude .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 8]: `` She joined us just before Christmas .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 4]: What 's up ?
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 11]: Is she really worth a lot of ` oof ? ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 17]: `` I should imagine not , '' laughed Bruce ; and Mr. Rosenheim joined another group .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 26]: Supper ended , Marie and Millie , and eke Flossie , attended by their swains , discussed coffee and cognac in the _ foyer _ .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 23]: Chance separated Miss le Marchant , as she may now be known , momentarily from the others , and Bruce darted forward .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 7]: `` Good-evening , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 10]: `` I am delighted to meet you here . ''
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 6]: The girl recognized him instantly .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 19]: She would have denied her identity , but her nerve failed her before those steadfast , penetrating eyes .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 21]: Moreover , it was not an ill thing for such a well-bred , well-dressed man to acknowledge her so openly .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 23]: `` Good-evening , Mr. Bruce , '' she said , with a smile of assurance , though her voice faltered a little .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 8]: He resolved to make the situation easy .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 28]: `` We have not met for such a long time , '' he said ; `` and I am simply dying to have a talk with you .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 22]: I am sure your friends will pardon me if I carry you off for five minutes to a quiet corner . ''
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 21]: With a simper , Miss le Marchant took his proffered arm , and they went off to an unoccupied table .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 57]: `` Now , Jane Harding , '' said he , with some degree of sternness in his manner , `` be good enough to explain to me why you are passing under a false name , and the reasons which led you to leave Sir Charles Dyke 's house in such a particularly disagreeable way . ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 3]: `` Disagreeable ?
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 7]: I only left in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 9]: Who had any right to stop me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 21]: `` No one , in a sense , except that Sir Charles Dyke may feel inclined to prosecute you . ''
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 8]: `` For what , Mr. Bruce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 13]: This emancipated servant girl was not such a simpleton as she looked .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 28]: It was necessary to frighten her and at the same time to force her to admit the facts with reference to her sensational flight from Wensley House .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 45]: `` You must know , '' he said , `` that Sir Charles Dyke can proceed against you in the County Court to recover wages in lieu of notice , and this would be far from pleasant for you in your new surroundings . ''
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 7]: `` Yes , I know that .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 28]: But why should Sir Charles Dyke , or you , or any other gentleman , want to destroy a poor girl 's prospects in that fashion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 19]: `` Surely , you must feel that some explanation is due to us for your extraordinary behavior ? ''
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 13]: `` No , I do n't feel a bit like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 9]: `` But why did you go away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 6]: `` To suit myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 8]: `` Could you not have given notice ?
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 20]: Why was it necessary to create a further scandal in addition to the disappearance of your unfortunate mistress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 7]: `` I am sorry for that .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 7]: It was thoughtless , I admit .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 13]: If I had to act over again I should have done differently .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 8]: But what does it matter now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 39]: `` It matters this much -- that the police must be informed of your existence , as they are searching for you , believing that you are in some way mixed up with Lady Dyke 's death . ''
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 24]: The girl started violently , and she flushed , rather with anger than alarm , Bruce thought , as he watched her narrowly .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 20]: `` The police , indeed , '' she snorted ; `` what have the police to do with me ?
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 11]: A nice thing you 're saying , Mr. Bruce . ''
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 11]: `` I am merely telling you the naked truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 4]: `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 3]: Tell them .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 11]: I do n't care a pin for them or you .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 16]: Have you anything else to say , because I wish to join my friends ? ''
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 18]: The girl 's language and attitude mystified him more than any preceding feature of this remarkable investigation .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 36]: She was , of course , far better educated than he had imagined , and the difference between the hysterical witness at the coroner 's inquiry and this pert , self-possessed young woman was phenomenal .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 11]: Rather than risk an open rupture , the barrister temporized .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 35]: `` If you are anxious to quarrel with me , by all means do so , '' he said ; `` but that was not my motive in speaking to you here to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 10]: Miss le Marchant shot a suspicious glance at him .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 11]: `` Then what was your motive , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 29]: `` Chiefly to reassure my friend , your former master , concerning you ; and , perhaps , to learn the cause of your very strange conduct . ''
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 12]: `` Why should Sir Charles bother his head about me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 7]: `` As I have told you .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 20]: Because of the coincidence between your departure and Lady -- '' `` Oh yes , I know that . ''
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 16]: Then she added testily : `` I was a fool not to manage differently . ''
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 9]: `` So you refuse me an explanation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 7]: `` No , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 8]: I have no reason to do so .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 46]: I came in for some money , and as I have longed all my life to be an actress I could not wait an hour , a moment , before I -- before I -- '' `` Before you tried to gratify your impulse . ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 12]: `` Yes , that is what I wanted to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 19]: `` But why not at least have written to Sir Charles , telling him of your intentions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 9]: The fair Marie was silent for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 5]: The question confused her .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 9]: `` I hardly know , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 9]: `` Will you write to him now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 10]: `` I do n't see why I should . ''
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 3]: `` Indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 38]: Not even when it was you who gave some of your mistress 's underclothing to Mr. White , by which means he was able to identify the body found at Putney as that of Lady Dyke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 11]: `` Mr. White told you that , did he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 5]: `` He did . ''
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 29]: `` Then you had better get him to give you all further information , Mr. Bruce , as not another word will you get out of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 13]: She bounced up , fiery red , pluming herself for the fray .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 10]: `` Will you not communicate with Sir Charles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 13]: he said , utterly baffled by Miss le Marchant 's uncompromising attitude .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 10]: `` Perhaps I will and perhaps I wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 6]: Mr. White , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 9]: And she ran off to join her friends .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 6]: The barrister drove quietly homewards .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 17]: This was his summary of the evening 's events : `` I have found two women .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 23]: When I know all about them I shall be able to lay my hand on the person who killed Lady Dyke . ''
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 38]: CHAPTER VII IN THE CITY Messrs. Dodge & Co. , of Leadenhall Street , possessed business premises of greater pretensions than Bruce had pictured to himself from Mrs. Hillmer 's description of their transactions with her brother .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 61]: Not only were their offices commodious and well situated , but a liberal display of gold lettering , intermingled with official brass plates marking the registering offices of many companies , gave evidence of some degree of importance -- whether fictitious or otherwise Bruce could not determine , as he scrutinized the exterior of the building on the following morning .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 49]: Moreover , workmen were even then busy in substituting the title `` Dodge , Son & Co. , Ltd. , '' for `` Messrs. Dodge & Company , '' the suggestive nature of the latter designation having perhaps proved a stumbling-block in the way of the guileless investor .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 43]: When the barrister entered the office , a busy place , a hive of many clerks , and adorned with gigantic maps of the Rand , West Australia , Cripple Creek , and Klondike , he asked for `` Mr. Dodge . ''
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 7]: His card procured him ready admission .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 12]: He was shown into an elaborately upholstered apartment of considerable size .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 32]: At the farther end , seated in front of a gorgeous American desk , was a young man who ostentatiously finished a letter and then motioned the barrister to a seat .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 16]: Bruce was curious on the question of the age of the head of the firm .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 11]: `` Are you Mr. Dodge , or the son ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 8]: he said , with the utmost gravity .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 14]: The other was taken back by this unexpected method of opening the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 4]: It annoyed him .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 29]: `` I am the representative of the firm , sir , and fully able to deal with your business , whatever it may be , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 4]: `` No doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 17]: But it will simplify matters if I know exactly to whom I am addressing myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 52]: After an uneasy shuffling in his seat -- he could not guess what this keen-faced , earnest-eyed lawyer might want -- the representative of Messrs. Dodge , Son & Co. -LRB- Limited -RRB- explained that he was Dodge , and the name of the firm had been adopted for general purposes .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 14]: `` Then there is no ` son , ' I take it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 17]: `` Yes , there is , sir , '' -- this with a snort of anger .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 7]: `` How old is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 12]: `` What the Dickens has that got to do with it ?
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 19]: Will you kindly tell me what you want , sir , as my time is fully occupied ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 16]: `` Just now I want to know how old the ` son ' is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 9]: This calm persistence irritated Mr. Dodge beyond endurance .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 14]: `` Three years , confound you , and his sister is four months .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 14]: Can I oblige you with any more details concerning my family affairs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 23]: Having purposely raised this man to boiling point by this harmless method of examination , Claude tackled the real business in hand .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 30]: He was quite sure that a financial sharper in a temper was far more likely to blurt out the truth than if he were approached in a matter-of-fact manner .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 48]: `` To begin with , '' he explained , never taking his eyes off the furious face of Mr. Dodge , `` I have called to ask for information with regard to your dealings with Mr. Sydney H. Corbett , of Raleigh Mansions , Sloane Square . ''
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 10]: `` I never heard of him in my life .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 13]: You have evidently come to the wrong office , Mr. Bruce . ''
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 7]: `` Are you quite sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 6]: `` Well , nearly so .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 29]: However , I can tell you in a moment , as it is impossible for me to carry every name connected with several companies in my memory . ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 17]: Mr. Dodge recovered his temper now that he saw a chance of disconcerting his caustic visitor .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 16]: He touched an electric bell , and told the answering youth to send Mr. Hawkins .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 13]: `` My correspondence clerk , '' he explained loftily when Hawkins entered .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 17]: `` Are we in communication with any one named Sydney H. Corbett , Mr. Hawkins ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 6]: `` No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 9]: `` Have you ever heard the name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 6]: `` No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 5]: `` That will do .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 4]: You may go .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 14]: You see you have come to the wrong shop , Mr. Bruce . ''
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 8]: `` Yes , so I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 18]: The barrister kept looking at the back of Mr. Dodge 's head , but made no move .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 5]: Mr. Dodge became puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 29]: `` Now , Mr. Bruce , '' he cried , `` you know the age of my son , and the extent of my information about Mr. Corbett .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 13]: Is there anything else in which I may be of service ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 17]: You do a great deal of underwriting , mostly for the flotation of gold-mining companies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 5]: `` Y -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 9]: That is a branch of our business . ''
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 37]: `` I am interested in this class of undertaking , and I was given to understand that Mr. Corbett has had some dealings with you in a similar respect for a considerable sum of money . ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 10]: `` The name is absolutely unknown to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 4]: So I gather .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 7]: I am sorry to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 32]: Several clients of mine have money to invest in that way , and I naturally came to a firm whose name apparently figured largely in the transactions of Mr. Corbett . ''
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 19]: It was good to see the manner in which Mr. Dodge metaphorically kicked himself for his previous attitude .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 5]: His emotion was painful .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 14]: For quite an appreciable time he could not trust his sentiments to words .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 8]: At last he struggled to express himself .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 14]: `` Really , Mr. Bruce , if you had only put things differently .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 20]: Do n't you see , it rather upset me when you came in and began jawing about the youngsters .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 22]: And then you spring Mr. Corbett 's name on me -- a man of whom I have no sort of knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 12]: It must have been my firm of which your friends heard .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 10]: There is absolutely no other Dodge in Leadenhall Street .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 40]: Indeed , we are the only financial Dodges -- that is -- er -- Messrs. Dodge , Son & Co. -LRB- Limited -RRB- are the only firm of the name dealing with financial matters -- in the city . ''
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 41]: By this time Bruce had assured himself that Mr. Dodge did not know Mr. Corbett 's identity , and if Mrs. Hillmer 's brother had changed his name to conceal himself from Dodge , it was likely to be successful .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 27]: `` Anyhow , I am here , Mr. Dodge , '' he said cheerfully , `` so I may as well enter into negotiations with you .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 12]: Have you any good things in hand at this moment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 6]: `` Some of the best .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 27]: We are just waiting for the market to ease a bit , and we shall have at least five splendid properties to place before the public .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 9]: By the way , do you smoke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 14]: Bruce did smoke ; and Mr. Dodge produced a box of excellent cigars .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 7]: Then he warmed to his work .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 34]: `` Here is the prospectus of the Golden Halo Mine , capital # 150,000 , for which the vendors are asking # 140,000 in cash , with a working capital of # 10,000 .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 21]: The ore now in sight is estimated to produce two millions sterling , and the mine is not one-tenth developed .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 90]: We are offering underwriters ten per cent in cash , and there is not the slightest risk , as the shares will stand at a high premium within a few days after the lists -- '' `` It sounds most promising , '' said Bruce ; `` but my principals are more interested in taking up concerns which have been already established , but in which , for want of sufficient capital , the vendors ' shares have , by a process of reconstruction , come into the market .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 19]: If you have anything of that kind -- '' `` The very thing , '' interrupted Dodge excitedly .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 9]: `` The Springbok Mine will just suit 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 21]: After all is said and done , Golden Halos are a bit in the air , between you and me .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 8]: But the Springbok is a genuine article .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 25]: It was capitalized for a quarter of a million , and the directors went to allotment on a subscription list of about # 14,000 .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 18]: This money has been expended , but twice the amount is necessary to develop the property properly .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 23]: A call was made on the shares , but no one paid up , and there is a talk of compulsory reconstruction .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 21]: Believe me , money put into it now will yield two hundred per cent in dividends within twelve months . ''
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 17]: `` There is a whiff of scent on this trail , '' said Claude to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 9]: He added aloud : `` That looks promising .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 7]: Can you give me details ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 5]: `` By all means .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 7]: Here is the original prospectus . ''
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 26]: Bruce glanced through the document , which dealt with the Springbok claims on the Rand with more candor than is usually exhibited in such compilations .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 29]: Judging from the reports of several mining engineers of repute it really looked as if , this time , Mr. Dodge were speaking with some degree of accuracy .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 9]: `` This reads well , '' said Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 15]: `` What proportion of share capital is falling in on the reconstruction scheme ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 39]: `` I hold fifty thousand shares myself , '' cried Dodge , `` and though my money is locked up just now I am so convinced about this mine that I will manage to pay the call myself .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 23]: Roughly speaking , there are one hundred and fifty thousand shares to be underwritten at , say , three shillings each . ''
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 9]: `` And who are the present holders ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 28]: The barrister asked the question in the most unconcerned way imaginable , yet upon the answer depended the whole success or otherwise of this hitherto unproductive mission .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 6]: Mr. Dodge was manifestly anxious .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 16]: `` I take it that we are talking with a definite view to business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 4]: The barrister hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 29]: Even in the detection of a crime a man does not care to tell a deliberate lie , and Dodge 's attitude so far had been candid enough .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 42]: The Springbok Mine honestly looked to be a good speculative investment , so he resolved to place the proposition before one or two friends who dealt with similar matters , and who were fully able to look after their own interests .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' he answered , `` I am here for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 14]: If my principals like this thing they will go in for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 22]: `` Then here is the vendors ' list , '' said Mr. Dodge , taking a foolscap sheet from a drawer .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 5]: Claude perused it nonchalantly .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 31]: His quick eyes took in each name and address out of half-a-dozen , and rejected all as being in no way connected with the man whose antecedents he was seeking .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 11]: Yet , where possible , he left nothing to chance .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 12]: `` Have you any objection to a copy being made ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 5]: Mr. Dodge hummed doubtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 33]: `` You see , '' went on the barrister , `` it is best to be quite candid with people whom you wish to bring into risky if apparently high promising ventures .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 7]: I presume these gentlemen are moneyless .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 13]: If so , it is a factor in favor of your scheme .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 24]: Should any of them be men of means , my principals would naturally ask why they did not themselves underwrite the shares . ''
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 5]: Mr. Dodge was convinced .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 18]: `` From that point of view , '' he cried emphatically , `` they are above suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 7]: Jot them down , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 17]: The barrister armed himself with the necessary documents , and they parted with mutual good wishes .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 20]: It was only after reflection that Mr. Dodge saw how remarkably little he had got out of the interview .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 14]: `` He was a jolly smart chap , '' communed the company promoter .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 9]: `` I wonder what he was really after .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 10]: And who the dickens is Mr. Sydney H. Corbett ?
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 10]: Anyhow , the Springbok business is quite above board .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 12]: How can I raise the wind for my little lot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 21]: If Mr. Bruce had probed more deeply Mr. Dodge 's holding , he would have been saved much future perturbation .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 25]: But , clever as he was , he did not know all the methods of financial juggling practised by experts on the Stock Exchange .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 9]: A hansom brought him quickly to Portman Square .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 21]: In fulfilment of his promise , he was about to place Sir Charles Dyke in possession of his recent discoveries .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 31]: When the door of Wensley House opened , the butler , Thompson , who happened to be in the hall , anticipated the footman 's answer to Bruce 's inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 11]: `` Sir Chawles left yesterday for Bournemouth , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 26]: E was that hovercome by the weather an ' his trouble that ' e has gone for a few days ' rest at the seaside .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 29]: If you called , sir , I was to tell you ' e would be glad to see you there should you find it convenient to run down .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 21]: And , sir , you 'll never guess who came ` ere this morning , as bold as brass . ''
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 5]: `` Jane Harding . ''
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 18]: `` Now , ` ow upon earth can you ` it upon things that way , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 10]: It was ` er , ` er very self .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 10]: And you ought to ` ave seen her airs .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 16]: ` Thompson , ' sez she , ` is Sir Chawles at ` ome ? '
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 23]: ` No , ' e is n't , ' sez I ; ` but you 're wanted at the polis station . '
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 28]: She was in a keb , and she ` ad asked a butcher 's boy to pull the bell , so ` im and the cabby larfed .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 25]: ` Thompson , ' she said , very red in the face , ` I 'll ` ave you dismissed for your impidence . '
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 6]: An ' off she went .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 12]: Did you ever ` ear anythink like it , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 14]: `` No , Thompson , Miss Harding is certainly a cool hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 20]: Bruce walked to his chambers , and his stroll through the parks was engrossed by one subject of thought .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 15]: It was not Mrs. Hillmer , nor Corbett , nor Dodge who troubled him .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 16]: What puzzled him more than all else was the `` impidence '' of Jane Harding .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 13]: CHAPTER VIII THE HOTEL DU CERCLE Bruce did not go to Bournemouth .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 32]: He quitted London by the next mail , and after a wearisome journey of thirty-six hours , found himself in the garden courtyard of the Hotel du Cercle at Monte Carlo .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 31]: Refreshed by a bath and an excellent _ déjeuner _ , he decided to go quietly to work and search the visitors ' book for himself without asking any questions .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 57]: The Hotel du Cercle was a popular resort , and it took him some time , largely devoted to the elucidation of hieroglyphic signatures , before he was quite satisfied that no one even remotely suggestive of the name of Sydney H. Corbett had recorded his presence in the hotel since the first week in November .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 14]: The barrister , for the first time , began to doubt Mrs. Hillmer .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 10]: Twice had her statements not been verified by facts .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 42]: It was with an expression of keen annoyance at his own folly in trusting so much to a favorable impression that he turned to the hotel clerk to ask if the name of Mr. Sydney H. Corbett was familiar to him .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 21]: The courteous Frenchman screwed up his forehead into a reflective frown before he answered : `` But yes , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 13]: Me , I have not seen the gentleman , but he exists .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 11]: There have been letters -- two , three letters . ''
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 5]: `` Ah , letters !
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 6]: Has he received them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 29]: The attendant examined a green baize-covered board , decorated with diamonds of tape , in which was stuck an assortment of letters , mostly addressed to American tourists .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 5]: `` They were here !
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 4]: They have gone !
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 7]: Then he has taken them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 17]: `` Yes , '' cried Bruce ; `` but surely you know something about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 10]: This hall is open to all the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 24]: `` Do you tell me that any one can come here and take any letters which may be stuck in that rack ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 9]: `` Will the gentleman be pleased to consider ?
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 15]: Many persons give their address here days and weeks before they come to arrive .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 21]: Some persons , in the manner of Monte Carlo , do not wish their names to be known of everybody .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 5]: We can not distinguish .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 26]: We do not allow the address of the hotel to be used improperly , if we know it ; but there are no complaints . ''
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 9]: The barrister did not argue the matter further .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 23]: He only said : `` Perhaps you can tell me thus far , as I am very anxious to meet Mr. Corbett .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 14]: About how long is it since the last letter came for him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 4]: `` But certainly .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 4]: It came yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 9]: It was re-addressed from some place in London .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 16]: If possible , with the next one I will keep watch for Mr. Corbett . ''
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 8]: So Mrs. Hillmer had not misled him .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 17]: The so-called Corbett was in Monte Carlo , but had possibly disguised himself under another name .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 27]: Again did Bruce consult the hotel register , this time with the aid of the vendors ' list in the Springbok Mine , but without result .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 26]: There was nothing for it but to familiarize himself with Monte Carlo and its _ habitués _ , awaiting developments in the chase of Corbett .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 31]: In January , when London alternates between fog and sleet , it is not an intolerable thing to remain in forced idleness amid the sunshine and flowers of the Riviera .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 11]: There are two ways of `` doing '' Monte Carlo .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 59]: You may live riotously , lose your substance at the Casino , and go home on a free ticket supplied by the proprietors of the gambling saloons , or you may enjoy to the utmost the keen air , magnificent scenery , fine promenades , and excellent music -- the two latter provided by the same benevolent agency .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 14]: It is needless to say which of these alternatives appealed to Claude Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 30]: Being a rich man , it was of no consequence to him to lose a few louis in backing the red for a five minutes ' bit of excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 19]: Being a sensible one , he then quitted the Casino and went for a stroll in the gardens .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 32]: Fashion , backed by the doctors , has decreed that no longer shall the northern littoral of the Mediterranean be the only haven of rest for those afflicted with pulmonary complaints .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 50]: Weak-chested and consumptive people are now banished to the windless and icy altitudes of Switzerland ; so of recent years a walk through Nice , Mentone , or Monte Carlo itself is not such a depressing experience as it was when every second person encountered was a hopeless invalid .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 36]: A pigeon-shooting match was in progress , and , as Bruce fell in with a friend who took a prominent part in local life , the two entered the club grounds to watch the contest .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 19]: At the moment a handsome , well-set-up young Englishman was shooting off a tie with a Russian count .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 33]: A very pretty girl , with a delicate and refined beauty enhanced by a pleasant expression , was taking a most unfeminine interest in the slaughter of the pigeons by the Englishman .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 6]: Her eyes spoke her thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 28]: It was as if they said : `` I do not want the birds to be killed , but I want a certain person to win . ''
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 14]: Nine birds each had been grassed , and the Russian was growing impatient .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 11]: The Englishman was cool , his fair backer keenly excited .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 8]: The Count fired and missed his tenth .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 19]: Up rose the Englishman 's bird , and the girl could not restrain an impetuous `` Now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 6]: So the Englishman missed also .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 21]: Amidst the buzz of comment which arose , Bruce said to his companion : `` What 's going on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 10]: `` This is the final tie in the International .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 14]: It is a big prize , and each man has backed himself heavily .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 9]: The two are Albert Mensmore and Count Bischkoff .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 11]: The girl has taken all the nerve out of Mensmore .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 9]: Bar accident , he is a goner . ''
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 5]: The cynic was right .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 21]: In the thirteenth round the count alone scored , and smiled largely in response to his antagonist 's quiet congratulations .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 14]: As for the girl , it was with difficulty she restrained her tears .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 27]: `` I think that we have witnessed a tragedy , '' said Bruce 's acquaintance as they walked off ; and the barrister agreed with him .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 10]: He was sorry for Mensmore and his pretty supporter .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 15]: Mayhap the loss of the match meant a great deal to both of them .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 15]: That night he learned by chance that Mensmore lived at the Hotel du Cercle .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 14]: He met him in the billiard-room and tried to inveigle him into conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 13]: But the young fellow was too miserable to respond to his advances .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 19]: Beyond a mere civil acknowledgement of some slight act of politeness , Bruce could not draw him out .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 7]: Next morning he saw Mensmore again .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 27]: If the man looked haggard the previous evening his appearance now was positively startling , that is , to one of Bruce 's powers of observation .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 16]: Ninety-nine men out of a hundred would have seen that Mensmore had not slept well .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 38]: Bruce was assured that , for some reason , the other 's brain was dominated by some overwhelming idea , and one which might eventuate in a tragic manner were it to be allowed to go unchecked .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 26]: For some reason he took a good deal of interest in his unfortunate fellow-countryman , and determined to help him if the opportunity presented itself .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 7]: It came , with dramatic rapidity .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 34]: During dinner he noticed that Mensmore was in such a state of mental disturbance that he ate and drank with the air of one who is feverishly wasting rather than replenishing his strength .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 32]: Soon after eight o'clock , at the hour when frequenters of the Casino go there in order to secure a seat for the evening 's play , Mensmore quitted the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 17]: Bruce followed him unobstrusively , and was just in time to see him enter the lift .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 26]: The barrister waited in the hall , having first secured his hat and overcoat from the bureau , where he happened to have left them .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 46]: Even while he noted the descending lift , in which he could see Mensmore , who had donned a light covert coat , the breast of which bulged somewhat on the left side , the hotel clerk came to him , triumphantly holding a letter .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 21]: `` And now , monsieur , '' cried the clerk , `` we shall see what we shall see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 21]: The missive was addressed to the mysterious Sydney H. Corbett , and had been forwarded by the Sloane Square Post-Office .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 15]: With a clang the door of the lift swung open and Mensmore hastened out .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 36]: Bruce had to decide instantly between the chance of seeing Corbett with his own eyes and pursuing the fanciful errand he had mapped out in imagination with reference to the stranger who so interested him .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 11]: `` Thank you , '' he said to the clerk .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 30]: `` I am going to the Casino for an hour ; you will greatly oblige me by keeping a sharp lookout for any one who claims the letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 11]: `` Monsieur , it shall have my utmost regard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 14]: The barrister had not erred in his surmise as to Mensmore 's destination .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 17]: The young man walked straight across the square and entered the grounds of the famous Casino .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 15]: Indoors , an excellent band was playing a selection from `` The Geisha . ''
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 64]: The spacious _ foyer _ was fast filling with a fashionable throng ; without , the silver radiance of the moon , lighting up gardens , rocks , buildings , and sea , might well have added the last link to the pleasant bondage that would keep any one from the gambling saloon that night ; but Mensmore heeded none of these things .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 33]: He passed the barrier , closely followed by Bruce , crossed the _ foyer _ , and disappeared through the baize doors that guard the magnificent room in which roulette is played .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 13]: Round several of the tables a fairly considerable crowd had gathered already .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 13]: The more , the merrier , is the rule of the Casino .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 14]: There is something curiously fascinating for the gambler in the presence of others .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 40]: It would seem to be an almost ridiculous thing for a man to stalk solemnly up to a deserted board and stake his money on the chances of the game merely for the edification of the officials in charge .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 42]: Bruce entered the room soon after Mensmore , and saw the latter elbowing his way to a seat about to be vacated by a stout Spanish lady , who had rapidly lost the sum she allowed herself to stake each day .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 35]: She was one of those numerous players who bring to the Casino a certain amount daily , and systematically stop playing when they have either lost their money or won a previously determined maximum .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 40]: This method , in fact , when combined with a careful system , is the only one whereby even a rich individual can indulge in a costly pastime , and , at the same time , escape speedy ruin .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 41]: With a fair share of luck it may be made to pay ; with continuous bad fortune the loss is spread over such a period that common sense has some opportunity to rescue the victim before it is too late .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 22]: Claude took up a position from which he could note the actions of the stranger in whom he was so interested .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 7]: At first , Mensmore staked nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 97]: He placed a small pile of gold in front of him ; he seemed to listen expectantly to the _ croupier 's _ monotonous cry -- '' _ Vingt-sept _ , _ rouge _ , _ impair _ , _ passe _ , '' or '' _ Dixhuit _ , _ noir _ , _ pair _ , _ manque _ , '' and so on , while the little ivory ball whirred around the disc , and the long rakes , with unerring skill , drew in or pushed forward the sums lost or won .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 17]: The dominant expression of Mensmore 's face as he sat and listened was one of disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 9]: Something for which he waited did not happen .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 32]: At last , with a tightening of his lips and a gathering sternness in his eyes , he placed five louis on the red , the number previously called being thirteen .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 3]: Black won .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 27]: For the next three attempts , each time with a five louis stake on the board , Mensmore backed the red , but still black won .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 26]: Next to him , an Italian , betting in notes of a thousand francs each , had quadrupled his first bet by backing the black .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 31]: Both men rose simultaneously , the Italian grinning delightedly at a smart Parisienne , who joyously nodded her congratulations , the Englishman quiet , utterly unmoved , but slightly pallid .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 15]: He passed out into the _ foyer _ and stopped to light a cigarette .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 18]: Bruce noticed that his hand was steady , and that all the air of excitement had gone .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 5]: These were ill signs .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 18]: There is no man so calm as he who has deliberately resolved to take his own life .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 44]: That Mensmore was ruined , that he was hopelessly in love with a woman whom he could not marry , and that he was about to commit suicide , Bruce was as certain as though the facts had been proved by a coroner .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 12]: But this thing should not happen if he could prevent it .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 11]: The band was now playing one of Waldteufel 's waltzes .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 10]: Mensmore listened to the fascinating melody for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 20]: He hesitated at the door of the writing-room ; but he went out , puffing furiously at his cigarette .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 25]: A guard looked at him as he turned to the right of the entrance , and made for the shaded terraces overlooking the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 25]: `` A silent Englishman , '' thought the man ; and he caught sight of Bruce , also smoking , preoccupied , and solitary .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 5]: `` Another silent Englishman .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 4]: _ Mon Dieu !
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 9]: _ What miserable lives these English lead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 37]: And so the two vanished into the blackness of the foliage , while , within the brilliantly lighted building , the _ frou-frou _ of silk mingled with soft laughter and the sweet strains of music .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 17]: If it be true that extremes meet , then this was a night for a tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 18]: CHAPTER IX BREAKING THE BANK There were not many people in this part of the Casino gardens .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 38]: A few love-making couples and a handful of others who preferred the chilly quietude of Nature to the throng of the interior promenade , made up the occupants of the winding paths that cover the seaward slope .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 5]: At last Mensmore halted .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 20]: There was no one in front , and he turned to look if the terrace were clear behind him .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 31]: He caught sight of Bruce , but did not recognize him , and leant against a low wall , ostensibly to gaze at the sea until the other had passed .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 12]: Claude came up to him and cried cheerily : `` Hello !
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 7]: Is that you , Mr. Mensmore ?
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 8]: Is n't it a lovely night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 46]: Mensmore , startled at being thus unexpectedly addressed by name , wheeled about , stared at the new-comer , and said , very stiffly : `` Yes ; but I felt rather seedy in the Casino , so I came here to be alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 9]: `` Of course , '' answered the barrister .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 9]: `` You look a little out of sorts .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 7]: Perhaps got a chill , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 12]: It is dangerous weather here , particularly on these heavenly evenings .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 16]: Come back with me to the hotel , and have a stiff brandy and soda .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 7]: It will brace you up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 8]: Mensmore flushed a little at this persistence .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 29]: `` I tell you , '' he growled , `` that I only require to be left in peace , and I shall soon recover from my indisposition .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 25]: I am awfully obliged to you , but -- '' `` But you wish me to walk on and mind my own business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 8]: `` Not exactly that , old chap .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 7]: Please do n't think me rude .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 16]: I am very sorry , but I _ ca n't _ talk much to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 5]: `` So I understand .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 23]: That is why I think it is best for you to have company , even such disagreeable companionship as my own . ''
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 30]: `` Confound it , man , '' cried the other , now thoroughly irritated ; `` tell me which way you are going and I will take the other .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 18]: Why on earth can not you take a polite hint , and leave me to myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 28]: `` It is precisely because I am good at taking a hint that I positively refuse to leave you until you are safely landed at your hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 13]: Indeed , I may stick to you then for some hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 6]: `` The devil take you !
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 6]: What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 7]: `` Exactly what I say . ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 17]: `` If you do n't quit this instant I will punch your head for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 5]: You are recovering already .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 11]: But before you start active exercise take your overcoat off .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 14]: That revolver in the breast pocket might go off accidentally , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 23]: Besides , as I shall hit back , I might fetch my knuckles against it , and that would be hardly fair .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 19]: Otherwise , I can do as much in the punching line as you can , any day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 6]: This reply utterly disconcerted Mensmore .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 21]: `` Look here , '' he said , avoiding Bruce 's steadfast gaze , `` what are you talking about ?
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 12]: What has it got to do with you , anyhow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 7]: `` Oh , a great deal .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 12]: My business principally consists in looking after other people 's affairs .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 23]: Just now it is my definite intention to prevent you from blowing out your brains , or what passes for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 15]: `` Then all I can say is that I wish you were in Jericho .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 14]: It is your own fault if you get into trouble over this matter .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 11]: Had you gone about your business I would have waited .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 33]: As it is -- '' It so happened that the guard , having nothing better to do , strolled along the terraces by the same path that Mensmore and Bruce had followed .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 38]: The first sight that met his astonished eyes , when in the flood of moonlight he discovered their identity , was the spectacle of these two springing at each other like a pair of wild cats . ''
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 16]: _ Parbleu _ , '' he shouted , `` the solitary ones are fighting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 35]: He ran forward , drawing his short sword , ready to stick the weapon into either of the combatants if the majesty of the law in his own person were not at once respected .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 9]: In reality , the affair was simple enough .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 25]: Mensmore made an ineffectual attempt to draw his revolver , and Bruce pinioned him before he could get his hand up to his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 28]: Both men were equally matched , and it was difficult to say how the struggle might have ended had not the sword-brandishing guard appeared on the scene .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 12]: Claude , even in this excited situation , kept his senses .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 36]: Mensmore , blind with rage and the madness of one who would voluntarily plunge into the Valley of the Shadow , took heed of naught save the effort to rid himself of the restraining clutch .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 6]: `` Put away your sword .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 6]: Seize his arms from behind .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 16]: He is a suicide , '' shouted the barrister to the gesticulating and shrieking Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 8]: Fortunately , Bruce was an excellent linguist .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 30]: The man caught Mensmore 's arms , put a knee in the small of his back , and doubled him backwards with a force that nearly dislocated his spine .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 14]: In the same instant Claude secured the revolver , which he promptly pocketed .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 12]: `` It is well , '' he said to the guard .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 6]: `` Here is a louis .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 8]: Say nothing , but leave us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 35]: `` Monsieur understands that the honor of a French policeman -- '' `` I understand that if there is any report made of this affair to the authorities you will be dismissed for negligence .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 17]: Had this lunatic been left to your care he would now have been lying here dead .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 6]: Do you doubt me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 4]: The guard hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 25]: `` Monsieur mentioned a louis , '' he said , for Bruce 's finger and thumb had returned the coin to his waistcoat pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 23]: This transaction satisfactorily ended , Bruce accosted Mensmore , who was awkwardly twisting himself to see if his backbone were all right .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 10]: `` You are not hurt , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 5]: `` It is matterless .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 15]: Why could you not let me finish the business in my own way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 13]: `` Because the world has some use for a man like you .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 15]: Because you are a moral coward , and require support from a stronger nature .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 35]: Because I did not want to think of that girl crying her eyes out to-morrow when she read of your death , or heard of it , as she assuredly would have done . ''
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 19]: Mensmore , though still furious at his fellow-countryman 's interference , was visibly amazed at this final reference .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 9]: `` What do you know about her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 11]: `` Nothing , save what my eyes tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 14]: `` They seem to tell you a remarkable lot about my affairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 3]: `` Possibly .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 29]: Meanwhile I want you to give me your word of honor that you will not make any further attempt on your life during the next seven days . ''
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 10]: `` The word of honor of a disgraced man !
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 6]: Will you accept it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 5]: `` Most certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 11]: `` You are a queer chap , and no mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 7]: Very well , I give it .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 13]: At the same time , I can not help dying of starvation .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 9]: I lost my last cent to-night at roulette .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 12]: I am hopelessly involved in debts which I can not pay .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 8]: I have no prospects and no friends .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 23]: You are not doing me a kindness , my dear fellow , in keeping me alive , even for seven days . ''
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 17]: `` You might have obtained your fare to London from the authorities of the Casino ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 3]: `` Hardly .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 7]: I lost very little at roulette .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 7]: I am not such a fool .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 18]: My losses are nearly all in bets over the pigeon-shooting match which I ought to have won .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 16]: I was backing myself at a game where I was apparently sure to succeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 12]: `` Until you were beaten by a woman 's voice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 5]: `` Yes , wizard .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 10]: I am too dazed to wonder at you sufficiently .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 24]: Yet I would have lost fifty times for her sake , though it was for her sake that I wanted to win . ''
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 7]: `` Come , let us smoke .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 11]: Sit down , and tell me all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 9]: They took the nearest seat , lighting cigarettes .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 25]: The guard , watching them from the shade of a huge palm-tree , murmured : `` Holy Virgin , what madmen are these English !
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 22]: They move apart , unknown ; they fight ; they fraternize ; they consume tobacco -- all within five minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 16]: And he lovingly felt for the louis to assure himself that he was not dreaming .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 48]: `` There is not much to tell , '' said Mensmore , who had quite recovered his self-control , and was now trying to sum up the man who had so curiously entered his life at the moment when he had decided to do away with it .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 23]: `` I came here , being a poor chap living mostly on my wits , to go in for the pigeon-shooting tournaments .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 10]: I won several , and was in fair funds .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 6]: Then I fell in love .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 14]: The girl is rich , well-connected , and all that sort of thing .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 25]: She is the first good influence that has crossed my life , so I thought that perhaps my luck was now going to turn .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 17]: I backed myself for all I was worth , and more , to win the championship .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 12]: If it came off I should have won over # 3,000 .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 16]: As it is , I owe # 500 , which must be paid on Monday .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 32]: My total assets , after I settled my hotel bill and sent a cheque to a chum who took some of my bets in his own name , was # 16 .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 5]: Now I have nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 19]: So you see -- '' `` Yes , '' interrupted Bruce , `` it is a hard case .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 6]: But death is no settlement .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 10]: Nobody gets paid , and everybody is worried . ''
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 15]: `` My dear fellow , my life is in your keeping for seven days .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 14]: After that , I presume , I take myself in charge again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 33]: The barrister took thought for a while before he inquired : `` Why did you go to the Casino to-night , if you did not patronize the tables as a rule ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 8]: The other colored somewhat and laughed sarcastically .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 8]: `` Just a final bit of folly .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 9]: I dreamt that my luck had turned . ''
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 4]: `` Dreamt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 6]: `` Yes , last night .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 39]: Three times did I imagine that I was playing roulette , and that after a certain number -- whether thirteen or twenty-three I was uncertain -- turned up , there was a run of seventeen on the red .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 25]: The funny thing is that I had an impression that the number was twenty-three , but with a doubt that it might be thirteen .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 25]: I remember , during a sub-conscious state in the third dream , resolving to listen and look more carefully to discover the exact number .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 6]: But again things got blurred .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 18]: The only clear point was that the run of seventeen on the red commenced at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 37]: `` Well , I took my remaining cash , went to the Casino , became a bit impatient when neither number turned up for quite a while , and when thirteen appeared I backed the red .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 11]: But four times it was the black that won . ''
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 6]: `` So I saw . ''
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 10]: `` Have you been keeping guard over me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 10]: `` Yes , in a sort of way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 7]: `` You are a queer chap .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 12]: I ca n't help saying that I am obliged to you .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 8]: But it wo n't do any good .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 7]: I am absolutely dead broke . ''
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 6]: `` Now listen to me .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 22]: I will pay your fare back to London and give you something to live on until I return a week hence .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 19]: Then you must come to see me , and I will help you into some sort of situation .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 14]: But you must once and for all abandon this notion of suicide . ''
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 7]: `` What about my debts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 5]: `` Confound your debts .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 13]: Tell people to wait until you are able to pay them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 8]: `` And -- and the girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 24]: `` If she is worth having she will give you a chance of making a living sufficient to enable you to marry her .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 17]: She is of age , I suppose , and can marry any one she likes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 11]: Mensmore puffed his cigarette in silence for fully a minute .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 25]: Then he said : `` You are a very decent sort , Mr. -- '' `` Bruce -- Claude Bruce is my name . ''
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 57]: `` Well , Mr. Bruce , you propose to hand me # 10 for my railway fare , and , say , # 5 for my existence , until we meet again in London , in exchange for which you purchase the rights in my life indefinitely , accidents and reasonable wear and tear excepted . ''
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 4]: `` Exactly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 16]: `` Make it # 20 , with five louis down , and I accept . ''
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 6]: `` Why the stipulation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 8]: `` I want to back my dream .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 5]: The number is twenty-three .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 6]: It evidently was not thirteen .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 8]: I want to see that thing through .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 21]: I will back the red after twenty-three turns up , and if I lose I shall be quite satisfied . ''
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 7]: `` What if I refuse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 16]: `` Then I do n't care a bit what happens during the next seven days .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 17]: After that , _ au revoir _ , should we happen to meet across the divide .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 7]: Please make up your mind quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 16]: That run on the red may come and go while we are sitting here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 5]: Bruce opened his pocket-book .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 19]: `` Here , '' he said with a smile , `` I will give you four hundred francs .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 13]: You will reach the maximum more quickly if you are right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 8]: Mensmore 's face lit up with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 13]: `` By Jove , you are a brick , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 8]: `` So you really trust me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 9]: `` Then give me back my revolver . ''
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 10]: Without a word , Bruce handed him the weapon .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 13]: Mensmore extracted the cartridges and threw them into a clump of shrubs .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 15]: `` Come , '' he cried ; `` come with me to the Casino .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 5]: You will see something .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 11]: This is not my own luck ; it is borrowed .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 5]: Come , quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 21]: They raced off , Bruce himself being more fired with the zest of the thing than he cared to admit .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 24]: Within the Casino all the tables were now crowded , but Mensmore hurried to that at which he sat during his earlier visit .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 24]: `` It was here that I played in my dream , '' he whispered , `` soon after I came to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 11]: He edged through the onlookers , closely followed by Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 22]: Neither cared for the scowls and injured looks cast at them by the people whom they forced out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 21]: The Italian , the winner of half an hour ago , had come back like a moth to the candle .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 8]: Now he was getting his wings singed .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 28]: At last , with a groan , he hastily rose , but as a final effort flung the maximum , six thousand francs , on the black .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 47]: The disc whirled and slowly slackened pace , the ball rested in one of the little squares , and the _ croupier 's _ monotonous words came : '' _ Vingt-trois _ , _ rouge _ , _ impair _ , _ et passe _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 25]: Out bounced the Italian , and Mensmore seized his chair , turning to Bruce with white face as he murmured : `` You hear !
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 3]: Twenty-three ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 18]: The barrister nodded , and placed his hands on Mensmore 's shoulders as though to steady him .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 9]: Mensmore staked his ten louis on the red .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 7]: They became twenty , then forty .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 7]: Another whirl and they were eighty .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 9]: A fourth made them one hundred and sixty .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 16]: Mensmore was now so agitated that the table and the players swam before his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 18]: But Bruce , under the stress of exciting circumstances , had the gift of remaining preternaturally cool .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 14]: At the fifth coup the sum to Mensmore 's credit was # 256 .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 25]: He would have left it all on the table had not Bruce withdrawn # 16 in notes , as the maximum is # 240 .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 18]: When Mensmore won the sixth and seventh coups a buzz of animated interest passed around the board .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 24]: People began to note the run on the red , together with the fact that a man was staking the maximum each time .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 34]: Even the _ croupiers _ cast fleeting glances at the new-comer , when , several times in succession , the long rake pushed across the table the little pile of money and notes .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 25]: Thenceforth Mensmore sat in a state of stupor more pronounced now that he was playing and awake than when he dreamt he was playing .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 35]: Each time he mechanically staked the maximum and received back twice as much , while the eager onlookers now burst into cries of wonder that brought others running from all parts of the room .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 7]: But Bruce did not lose count .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 50]: When the red had turned up seventeen times , and the amount to Mensmore 's credit was # 3,128 , he shook the latter violently as he was about to shove forward another maximum , and , of his own volition , placed the money on the black . ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 37]: _ Douze _ , _ noir _ , _ pair et manque _ , '' sang out the _ croupier _ , and Bruce hissed into Mensmore 's ear : `` Get up at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 58]: His strangely made acquaintance obeyed , gathered up his gold and notes , fastened them securely in an inner pocket , and the pair quitted the Casino amid extravagant protestations of good-will and friendship from all the voluble foreigners present , having attracted not a little attention from the less demonstrative Americans and English in the room .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 25]: It was some time before the roulette tables began their orderly round again , for Mensmore 's sensational performance was in everybody 's mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 31]: The highest recorded sum is twenty-three on the black , but a run of eighteen on the red is sufficiently remarkable to keep Monte Carlo in talk for a week .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 16]: Albert Mensmore certainly could not complain that the events of the particular evening were dull .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 39]: For one hour at least he lived in the fire that consumes , for he stepped back from the porch of dishonored death to find himself the possessor of a sum more than sufficient for his reasonable requirements .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 8]: The pace was rapid and almost fatal .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 18]: CHAPTER X SOME GOOD RESOLUTIONS Once safe in the seclusion of Claude 's sitting-room Mensmore almost collapsed .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 21]: The strain had been a severe one , and now he had to pay the penalty by way of reaction .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 31]: The barrister forced him to swallow a stiff brandy and soda , and then wished him to retire to rest , but the other protested with some show of animation .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 11]: `` Let me talk , for goodness ' sake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 7]: `` I can not be alone .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 11]: You have seen me through a lot of trouble to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 14]: Stick to me for another hour , there 's a good fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 4]: `` With pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 13]: Perhaps it is the best thing you can do , after all .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 10]: Let us see how much you have won . ''
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 29]: Bruce made a calculation on a sheet of paper and said : `` Exclusive of the original stake of ten louis you ought to have # 3,128 . ''
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 14]: Mensmore pulled out of his pocket the crumpled bundle of notes and bills .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 18]: Claude 's notes were among them , and he tossed them across the table with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 6]: `` There 's your capital .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 15]: I will see if the total is all right before we go shares . ''
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 16]: Claude nodded , and Mensmore began to jot down the items of his valuable package .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 15]: He bothered with the figures for some time but could not get them right .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 26]: Finally he tossed everything over to the other , saying : `` No matter how I count , I ca n't get this calculation straight .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 17]: Seventeen coups , beginning with ten louis , work out at # 3,128 all right enough .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 20]: But in this lot there is # 3,368 , and they do n't pay twice at the Casino . ''
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 12]: The barrister thought for a moment , and then laughed heartily .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 27]: `` I remember now , '' he said ; `` I kept careful count of the series of seventeen , or eighteen , to be exact .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 22]: On my own account , as you were too dazed to notice anything , I put a maximum on the black .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 14]: Your dream turned up trumps , as the series stopped and black won .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 7]: Hence the odd # 240 . ''
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 12]: `` Then that is yours , '' said the other gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 30]: `` I will take # 1,128 to square all my debts , and we go shares in the balance , a thousand each , if you think that fair .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 19]: If not I will gladly hand over the lot , after paying my debts , I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 16]: Mensmore 's seriousness impressed the barrister more than any other incident of that dramatic evening .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 23]: `` You forget , '' he replied , `` that I told you I had money in plenty for my own needs .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 18]: You must keep every farthing except my own # 8 , which you do not now need .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 5]: Please do not argue .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 8]: I will consent to no other course .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 24]: This turn of Fortune 's wheel should provide you with sufficient capital to branch out earnestly in your career , whatever it be .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 10]: I will ask my interest in different manner . ''
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 14]: `` I can never repay you , in gratitude , at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 14]: And there is another who will be thankful to you when she knows .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 5]: Ask anything you like .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 6]: Make any stipulation you please .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 6]: I agree to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 6]: `` It is a bargain .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 4]: Sign this . ''
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 53]: Bruce took a sheet of notepaper , bearing the crest of the Hotel du Cercle , dated it , and wrote : `` I promise that , for the space of twelve months , I will not make a bet of any sort , or gamble at any game of chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 11]: When Mensmore read the document his face fell a little .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 8]: `` Wo n't you except pigeon-shooting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 12]: `` I am sure to beat that Russian next time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 8]: `` I can allow no exceptions . ''
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 10]: `` But why limit me for twelve months ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 54]: `` Because if in that time you do not gain sense enough to stop risking your happiness , even your life , upon the turn of a card or the flight of a bird , the sooner thereafter you shoot yourself the less trouble you will bring upon those connected with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 21]: `` You are a rum chap , '' murmured Mensmore , `` and you put matters pretty straight , too .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 5]: However , here goes .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 11]: You do n't bar me from entering for sweepstakes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 31]: He signed the paper , and tossed it over to Bruce , while the latter did not comment upon the limitation of his intentions imposed by Mensmore 's final sentence .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 23]: The man undoubtedly was a good shot , and during his residence in the Riviera he might pick up some valuable prizes .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 29]: `` And now , '' said the barrister , `` may I ask as a friend to what use you intend to put your newly found wealth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 8]: `` Oh , that is simple enough .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 17]: I have to pay # 500 which I lost in bets over that beastly unlucky match .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 56]: Then I have a splendid ` spec , ' into which I will now be able to place about # 2,000 -- a thing which I have good reason to believe will bring me in at least ten thou ' within the year , and there is nearly a thousand pounds to go on with .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 7]: And all thanks to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 6]: `` Never mind thanking me .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 15]: I am only too glad to have taken such a part in the affair .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 13]: I will not forget this night as long as I live . ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 8]: `` Nor I. Just think of it .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 22]: I might be lying in the gardens now , or in some mortuary , with half my head blown off . ''
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 26]: `` Tell me , '' said Bruce , between the contemplative puffs of a cigar , `` what induced you to think of suicide ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 13]: `` It was a combination of circumstances , '' replied the other .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 21]: `` You must understand that I was somewhat worried about financial and family matters when I came to Monte Carlo .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 15]: It was not to gamble , in a sense , that I remained here .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 28]: I have loafed about the world a good deal , but I may honestly say I never made a fool of myself at cards or backing horses .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 26]: At most kinds of sport I am fairly proficient , and in pigeon-shooting , which goes on here extensively , I am undoubtedly an expert .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 20]: For instance , all this season I have kept myself in funds simply by means of these competitions . ''
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 5]: His hearer nodded approvingly .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 29]: `` Well , in the midst of my minor troubles , I must needs go and fall over head and ears in love -- a regular bad case .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 13]: She is the first woman I ever spoke two civil words to .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 37]: We met at a picnic along the Corniche Road , and she sat upon me so severely that I commenced to defend myself by showing that I was not such a surly brute as I looked .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 11]: By Jove , in a week we were engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 8]: The barrister indulged in a judicial frown .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 26]: It 's none of your silly , sentimental affairs in which people part and meet months afterwards with polite inquiries after each other 's health .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 19]: I am not made that way ; neither is Phil -- Phyllis is her name , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 5]: This is for life .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 19]: I am just bound up in her , and she would go through fire and water for me .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 17]: But she is rich , the only daughter of a Midland iron-master with tons of money .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 27]: Her people are awfully nice , and I think they approve of me , though they have no idea that Phil and I are engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 13]: He paused to gulp down a strong decoction of brandy and soda .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 9]: The difficult part of his story was coming .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 51]: `` You can quite believe , '' he continued , `` that I did not want to ask her father , Sir William Browne -- he was knighted by the late Queen for his distinguished municipal services -- to give his daughter to a chap who had n't a cent .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 23]: He supposes I am fairly well off , living as I do , and I ca n't bear acting under false pretences .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 22]: I hate it like poison , though in this world a man often has to do what he does n't like .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 13]: However , this time I determined to be straight and above board .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 58]: It was a very odd fact , but I just wanted # 3000 to enable me to make a move which , I tell you , ought to result in a very fair sum of money , sufficient , at any rate , to render it a reasonable proposition for Phil and me to get married . ''
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 6]: Claude was an appreciative listener .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 22]: These love stories of real life are often so much more dramatic than the fictions of the novel or the stage .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 14]: `` The opportunity came , to my mind , in this big tournament .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 26]: I had no difficulty of getting odds in six or seven to one to far more than I was able to pay if I lost .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 26]: Phil came into the scheme with me -- she knows all about me , you know -- and we both regarded it as a certainty .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 5]: Then the collapse came .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 24]: She wanted to get the money from her mother to enable me to pay up , but I would not hear of it .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 12]: I pretended that I could raise the wind some other way .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 14]: The fact is I was wild with myself and with my luck generally .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 26]: Then there was the disgrace of failing to settle on Monday , combined with the general excitement of that dream and a fearfully disturbed night .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 29]: To make a long story short , I thought the best thing to do was to try a final plunge , and if it failed , to quit .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 26]: I even took steps to make Phil believe I was a bad lot , so that she might not fret too much after me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 12]: Mensmore 's voice was a little unsteady in this last sentence .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 24]: The barrister tried to cheer him by a little bit of raillery : `` I hope you have not succeeded too well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 3]: he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 9]: `` Oh , it is all right now .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 31]: I mean that I left her some papers which would bring things to her knowledge that , unexplained by me , would give any one a completely false impression . ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 15]: The subject was evidently a painful one , so Bruce did not pursue it .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 11]: `` About this speculation of yours , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 19]: `` Are you sure it 's all right , and that you will not lose your money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 11]: `` It is as certain as any business can be .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 17]: It is a matter I thoroughly understand , but I will tell you all about it .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 29]: If you will pardon me a moment I will bring you the papers , as I should like to have your advice , and it is early yet .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 13]: You do n't want to go to bed , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 6]: `` Not for hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 19]: Mensmore rose , but before he reached the door a gentle tap heralded the appearance of the hall-porter .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 9]: `` There is a letter for the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 7]: Monsieur is not in his room .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 13]: He is reported to be here , so I bring it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 36]: Mensmore took the note , read it with a smile and a growing flush , and handed it to the barrister , saying : `` Under the circumstances I think you ought to see this .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 7]: Is n't she a brick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 33]: The tiny missive ran : '' _ Dearest One _ , -- You must forgive me , but we are both so miserable about that wretched money that I told mother everything .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 23]: She likes you , and though she gave me a blowing up , she has promised to give me # 500 to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 7]: We can never thank her sufficiently .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 10]: Do come around and see me for a minute .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 9]: I will be in the verandah until eleven .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 8]: `` Ever yours , `` PHYLLIS . ''
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 5]: Claude returned the note .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 3]: `` Luck !
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 12]: you 're the luckiest fellow in the South of France ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 15]: `` Why , here 's the mother plotting with the daughter on your behalf .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 10]: Sir William has n't the ghost of a chance .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 9]: Off you go to that blessed verandah . ''
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 21]: When Mensmore had quitted the hotel Bruce descended to the bureau to take up the threads of his neglected quest .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 20]: The letter to Sydney H. Corbett was still unclaimed , and he thought he was justified in examining it .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 26]: On the reverse of the envelope was the embossed stamp of an electric-lighting company , so the contents were nothing more important than a bill .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 14]: An hour later Mensmore joined him in the billiard-room , radiant and excited .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 8]: `` Great news , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 8]: `` I squared everything with Lady Browne .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 21]: Told her I was only chaffing Phil about the five hundred , because she spoiled my aim by shrieking out .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 25]: Sir William has chartered a steam yacht to go for a three weeks ' cruise along the Gulf of Genoa and the Italian coast .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 16]: They have put him up to ask me in the morning to join the party .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 3]: Great Scott !
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 8]: what a night I 'm having ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 40]: They parted soon afterwards , and next morning Bruce was informed that his friend had gone out early , leaving word that he had been summoned to breakfast at the Grand Hotel , where Sir William Browne was staying .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 11]: During the afternoon Mensmore came to him like a whirlwind .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 10]: `` We 're off to-day , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 14]: `` By the way , where shall I find you in London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 33]: The barrister gave him his address , and Mensmore , handing him a card , said , `` My permanent address is given here , the Orleans Club , St. James 's .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 8]: But I will look you up first .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 9]: I shall be in town early in March .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 4]: And you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 10]: `` Oh , I shall be home much sooner .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 13]: Good-bye , and do n't let your good luck spoil you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 4]: `` No fear !
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 6]: Wait until you know Phyllis .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 18]: She would keep any fellow all right once he got his chance , as I have done .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 11]: Good-bye , and -- and -- God bless you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 15]: During the next three days Bruce devoted himself sedulously to the search for Corbett .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 16]: He inquired in every possible and impossible place , but the man had utterly vanished .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 14]: Nor did he come to claim his letter at the Hotel du Cercle .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 34]: It remained stuck on the baize-covered board until it was covered with dust , and the clerk of the bureau had grown weary of watching people who scrutinized the receptacle for their correspondence .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 27]: Others came and asked for Corbett -- sharp-featured men with imperials and long moustaches -- the interest taken in the man was great , but unrequited .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 4]: He never appeared .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 21]: At last the season ended , the hotel was closed , and the mysterious letter was shot into the dustbin .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 17]: CHAPTER XI THEORIES Bruce announced his departure from Monte Carlo by a telegram to his valet .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 47]: Nevertheless , he did not expect to find that useful adjunct to his small household -- Smith and his wife comprised the barrister 's _ ménage _ -- standing on the platform at Charing Cross when the mail train from the Continent steamed into the station .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 24]: Smith , who had his doubts about this sudden trip to the Riviera , was relieved when he saw his master was alone .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 14]: `` Sir Charles Dyke called this afternoon , sir , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 24]: `` I told Sir Charles about your wire , sir , and he is very anxious that you should dine with him to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 21]: You can dress at Portman Square , and if I come with you -- '' `` Yes ; I understand .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 7]: Bundle everything into a four-wheeler . ''
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 17]: `` Sir Charles thought you might come , sir , so he sent his carriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 16]: London looked dull but familiar as they rolled across Leicester Square and up Regent Street .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 18]: Your true Cockney knows that he is out of his latitude when the sky is blue overhead .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 24]: Let him hear the tinkle of the hansoms ' bells through a dim , fog-laden atmosphere , and he knows where he is .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 14]: There is but one London , and Cockneydom is the order of Melchisedek .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 41]: Claude 's heart was glad within him to be home again , even though the band was just gathering in the Casino gardens , and the lights of Monaco were beginning to gleam over the moon-lit expanse of the Mediterranean .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 23]: At Wensley House the traveller was warmly welcomed by the baronet , who seemed to have somewhat recovered his health and spirits .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 25]: Nevertheless , Bruce was distressed to note the ineffaceable signs of the suffering Sir Charles Dyke had undergone since the disappearance of his wife .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 9]: He had aged quite ten years in appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 39]: Deep lines of sorrowful thought had indented his brow , his face was thinner , his eyes had acquired a wistful look ; his air was that of a man whose theory of life had been forcibly reversed .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 45]: At first both men fought shy of the topic uppermost in their minds , but the after-dinner cigar brought the question to Dyke 's lips : `` And now , Claude , have you any further news concerning my wife 's -- death ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 11]: The barrister noted the struggle before the final word came .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 10]: The husband had , then , resigned all hope .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 9]: `` I have none , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 11]: `` That is to say , I have nothing definite .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 30]: I promised to tell you everything I did , so I will keep my promise , but you will , of course , differentiate between facts and theories ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 6]: The baronet nodded an agreement .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 29]: `` In the first place , '' said Bruce , `` let me ask you whether or not you have seen Jane Harding , the missing maid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 14]: It seems that she called here twice before she caught me at home .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 17]: At first she was very angry about a squabble there had been between Thompson and herself .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 7]: I refused to listen to it .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 23]: Then she told me how you had found her at some theatre , and she volunteered an explanation of her extraordinary behavior .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 22]: She said that she had unexpectedly come into a large sum of money , and that it had turned her head .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 34]: She was sorry for the trouble her actions had caused , so , under the circumstances , I allowed her to take away certain clothes and other belongings she had left here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 9]: `` Did she ask for these things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 8]: Made quite a point of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 7]: `` Did you see them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 26]: `` So you do not know whether they were of any value , or the usual collection of rubbish found in servants ' boxes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 9]: `` I have not the slightest notion . ''
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 13]: `` Have they ever been thoroughly examined by any one ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 9]: ` Pon my honor , I believe not .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 18]: Now that you remind me of it I think the girl seemed rather anxious on that point .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 22]: I remember my housekeeper telling me that Harding had asked her if her clothes had been ransacked by the detectives . ''
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 9]: `` And what did the housekeeper say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 7]: `` She will tell you herself .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 7]: Let us have her up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 6]: `` Do n't trouble her .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 14]: If I remember aright the police did not examine Jane Harding 's room .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 39]: They simply took your report and the statements of the other servants , while the housekeeper was responsible for the partial search made through the girl 's boxes for some clue that might lead to her discovery . ''
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 6]: `` That is so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 32]: The barrister smoked in silence for a few minutes , until Sir Charles broke out rather querulously : `` I suppose I did wrong in letting Harding take her traps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 9]: `` It is I who am to blame .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 11]: There is something underhanded about this young woman 's conduct .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 14]: The story about the sudden wealth is all bunkum , in one sense .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 17]: That she did receive a bequest or gift of a considerable sum can not be doubted .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 13]: That she at once decided to go on the stage is obvious .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 15]: But what is the usual course for a servant to pursue in such cases ?
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 22]: Would she not have sought first to glorify herself in the sight of her fellow-servants , and even of her employers ?
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 30]: Would there not have been the display of a splendid departure -- in a hansom -- with voluble directions to the driver , for the benefit of the footman ?
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 19]: As it was , Jane Harding acted suddenly , precipitately , under the stress of some powerful emotion .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 25]: I can not help believing that her departure from this house had some connection , however remote , with Lady Dyke 's disappearance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 14]: `` Good heavens , Claude , you never told me this before . ''
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 21]: `` True , but when we last met I had not the pleasure of Miss Marie le Marchant 's acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 16]: I wish to goodness I had rummaged her boxes before she carried them off . ''
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 14]: `` And I sincerely echo your wish , '' said Sir Charles testily .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 14]: `` It always seems , somehow , that I am to blame . ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 8]: `` You must not take that view .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 28]: I really wonder , Dyke , that you have not closed up your town house and gone off to Scotland for the fag-end of the shooting season .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 31]: You wo n't hunt , I know , but a quiet life on the moors would bring you right away from associations which must have bitter memories for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 31]: `` I would have done so , but I can not tear myself away while there is the slightest chance of the mystery attending my wife 's fate being unravelled .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 10]: I feel that I must remain here near you .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 17]: You are the only man who can solve the riddle , if it ever be solved .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 10]: By the way , what of Raleigh Mansions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 10]: The baronet obviously nerved himself to ask the question .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 5]: The reason was patent .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 39]: His wife 's inexplicable visit to that locality was in some way connected with her fate , and the common-sense view was that some intrigue lay hidden behind the impenetrable wall of ignorance that shrouded her final movements .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 6]: Bruce hesitated for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 14]: Was there any need to bring Mrs. Hillmer 's name into the business ?
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 17]: At any rate , he could fully answer Sir Charles without mentioning her at this juncture .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 27]: `` The only person in Raleigh Mansions who interests me just now is one who , to use a convenient bull , is not there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 34]: `` This person occupies a flat in No. 12 , his name is Sydney H. Corbett , and he left his residence for the Riviera two days after your wife was lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 12]: `` Now , who on earth can _ he _ be ?
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 45]: I am as sure as a man may be of anything that no one of that name was in the remotest way connected with either my wife or myself for the last -- let me see -- six years , at any rate . ''
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 3]: `` Possibly .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 16]: But you can not say that Lady Dyke may not have met him previously ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 14]: The baronet winced at the allusion as though a whip had struck him .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 20]: `` For heaven 's sake , Claude , '' he cried , `` do not harbor suspicions against her .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 6]: I can not bear it .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 11]: I tell you my whole soul revolts at the idea .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 22]: I would rather be suspected of having killed her myself than listen to a word whispered against her good name . ''
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 17]: `` I sympathize with you , but you must not jump at me in that fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 10]: One hypothesis is as wildly impossible as the other .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 23]: I did not say that Lady Dyke went to Raleigh Mansions on account of some present or bygone transgression of her own .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 13]: I would as soon think of my mother in such a connection .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 21]: But a pure , good woman will often do on behalf of others what she will not do for herself .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 29]: Really , Dyke , you must not be unjust to me , especially when you force me to tell you what may prove to be mere theories . ''
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 3]: `` Others ?
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 4]: What others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 6]: `` I can not say .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 5]: I wish I could .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 29]: If I once lay hold of the reason that brought Lady Dyke to Raleigh Mansions , I will , within twenty-four hours , tell you who murdered her .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 15]: Of that I am as certain as that the sun will rise to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 21]: And the barrister poked the fire viciously to give vent to the annoyance that his friend 's outburst had provoked .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 6]: `` Pardon me , Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 20]: Do not forget how I have suffered -- what I am suffering -- and try to bear with me .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 9]: I never valued my wife while she lived .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 13]: It is only now that I feel the extent of my loss .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 20]: If my own life would only restore her to me for an instant I would cheerfully give it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 10]: If ever man meant his words this man did .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 18]: His agitation moved the kindly hearted barrister to rise and place a gentle hand on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 20]: `` I am sorry , Dyke , '' he said , `` that the conversation has taken this turn .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 9]: These speculative guesses at potential clues distress you .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 21]: If you took my advice , you would not worry about events until at least something tangible turns up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 12]: `` Perhaps it is best so , '' murmured the other .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 11]: `` In any event , it is of little consequence .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 7]: I can not live long . ''
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 5]: `` Oh , nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 8]: You are good for another fifty years .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 8]: Come , shake off this absurd depression .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 8]: You can do no good by it .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 13]: I wish now I had taken you with me to Monte Carlo .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 15]: The fresh air would have braced you up while I hunted for Corbett . ''
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 7]: `` Did you find him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 30]: `` No , but I dropped in for an adventure that would cheer the soul of any depressed author searching vainly for an idea for a short story . ''
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 6]: `` What was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 38]: Claude , who possessed no mean skill as a _ raconteur _ , gave him the history of the Casino incident , and the thrilling _ dénouement _ so interested the baronet that he lit another cigar .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 11]: `` Did you ascertain the names of the parties ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 4]: `` Oh yes .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 38]: You will respect their identity , as the sensational side of the affair had better now be buried in oblivion , though , of course , all the world knows about the way we scooped the bank .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 28]: The lady is a daughter of Sir William Browne , a worthy knight from Warwickshire , and her rather rapid swain is a youngster named Mensmore . ''
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 4]: `` Mensmore ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 4]: shouted the baronet .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 8]: `` A youngster , you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 9]: and Sir Charles bounced upright in his excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 10]: `` Why , yes , a man of twenty-five .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 9]: No more than twenty-eight , I can swear .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 6]: Do you know him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 5]: `` Albert Mensmore ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 9]: `` That 's the man beyond doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 12]: Dyke hastily poured out some whiskey and water and swallowed it .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 37]: Then he spoke , with a faint smile : `` You did n't know , Bruce , '' he said , `` that you vividly described the attempted self-murder of a man I know intimately . ''
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 6]: `` What an extraordinary thing !
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 11]: Yet I never remember hearing you mention his name . ''
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 4]: `` Probably not .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 9]: I have hardly seen him since my marriage .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 31]: We were schoolboys together , though I was so much his senior that we did not chum together until later , when we met a good deal on the turf .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 11]: Then he went off , roughing it in the States .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 5]: It must be he .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 8]: It is just one of his pranks .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 9]: And he is going to marry , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 7]: Is she a nice girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 6]: The baronet was thoroughly excited .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 11]: He talked fast , and helped himself liberally to stimulants .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 6]: `` Yes , unusually so .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 10]: But I can not help marvelling at this coincidence .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 6]: It has upset you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 5]: `` Not a bit .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 27]: I was interested in your yarn , and naturally I was unprepared for the startling fact that an old friend of mine filled the chief part .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 17]: What a fellow you are , Claude , for always turning up at the right time .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 27]: I have never been in a tight place personally , but if I were I suppose you would come along and show me the way out .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 10]: Sit down again and give me all the details .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 7]: I am full of curiosity . ''
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 13]: Bruce had never before seen Sir Charles in such a hysterical mood .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 29]: The anguish of the past three months had changed the careless , jovial baronet into a fretful , wayward being , who had lost control of his emotions .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 7]: Undoubtedly he required some powerful tonic .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 51]: The barrister resolved to see more of him in the future , and not to cease urging him until he had started on a long sea voyage , or taken up some hobby that would keep his mind from brooding upon the everlasting topic of his wife 's strange death .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 8]: Dyke 's fitful disposition manifested itself later .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 30]: After he had listened with keen attention to all that Bruce had told him concerning Mensmore and Phyllis Browne , he suddenly swerved back to the one engrossing thought .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 11]: `` What are you going to do about Corbett ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 5]: `` Find him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 5]: `` But how ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 28]: `` People are always tied to a centre by a string , and no matter how long the string may be , it contracts sooner or later .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 22]: Corbett will turn up at Raleigh Mansions , and before very many weeks have passed , if I mistake not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 5]: `` And then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 14]: `` Then he will have to answer me a few pertinent questions . ''
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 12]: `` But suppose he knows nothing whatever about the business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 16]: `` In that case I must confess the clue is more tangled than ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 17]: `` It would be curious if Corbett and Jane Harding were in any way associated . ''
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 32]: `` If they were , it would take much to convince me that one or both could not supply at least some important information bearing on my -- on our quest .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 20]: If Mr. White even knew as much as I do about them he would arrest them at sight . ''
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 12]: `` Oh , he 's a thick-headed chap , is White .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 8]: By the way , that reminds me .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 27]: He got hold of the maid , it seems , before she had bolted , and made her give him some of my wife 's clothes .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 28]: By that means he established some sort of a theory about -- '' `` About a matter on which we differ , '' put in Bruce quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 9]: `` Let us talk of something else . ''
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 11]: The other moved restlessly in his chair , but yielded .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 17]: For the remainder of the evening they discussed questions irrelevant to the course of this narrative .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 18]: It was late when they separated , but Bruce found Smith sitting up for him at home .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 15]: That faithful servitor bustled about , stirring the fire and turning up the lights .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 27]: Finally he nervously addressed his master : `` Pardon me , sir , but there was a policeman here asking about you to-night , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 5]: `` A policeman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 15]: `` Well , sir , a detective -- Mr. White , of Scotland Yard .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 13]: I knew him , sir , though he did not think it .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 13]: He came about ten o'clock , and asked where you were . ''
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 7]: `` Did you tell him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 31]: `` Well , sir , '' and Smith shifted from one foot to the other , `` I thought it best to let him know the truth , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 14]: `` Good gracious , Smith , he is not going to handcuff me .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 5]: You did quite right .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 6]: What did he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 12]: `` Nothing , sir ; except that he would call again .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 16]: He would n't leave his name , but I know 'd him all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 2]: Good-night .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 10]: It was unnecessary that you should have remained up .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 11]: But I am obliged to you all the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 10]: The barrister laughed as he went to his room .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 27]: `` Really , '' he said to himself , still highly amused , `` White will cap all his previous feats by trying to arrest me .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 13]: I suspect he has thought of it for a long time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 10]: And Mr. White _ had _ thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 10]: CHAPTER XII WHO CORBETT WAS `` Inexorable Fate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 28]: is a favorite phrase with the makers of books ; but Fate , being feminine according to the best authorities , is also somewhat fickle in disposition .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 47]: Not only is she not invariably inexorable , but at times she delights to play with her poor subjects , to dazzle them with surprise , as it were , to stupefy them with the sense of their sheer inability to foresee or understand her vagaries .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 18]: It was Bruce 's turn to receive the sharpest lesson in this respect that he ever remembered .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 19]: At breakfast the next morning he selected from a packet of unimportant letters one which required immediate attention .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 29]: The financiers to whom he had written in conformity with his implied promise to Mr. Dodge had replied favorably with reference to the reconstruction of the Springbok Mine .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 27]: They informed Bruce confidentially that a thoroughly reliable man in Johannesburg , to whom they had cabled , reported very strongly in favor of the property .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 11]: They would await his written statement before finally committing themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 53]: Meanwhile , if Messrs. Dodge , Son & Co. -LRB- Limited -RRB- were anxious to get the business advanced a stage , there was no reason why he -LRB- Bruce -RRB- should not assure them that , subject to the first satisfactory report being confirmed , his clients would underwrite the shares .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 12]: The whole thing would thus go through in about three weeks .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 24]: As for Bruce himself , they proposed to give him a commission of five per cent in fully paid shares for the introduction .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 7]: `` Well , I never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 3]: he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 11]: `` Now who would have thought such a thing possible ?
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 27]: Why , if that rascal Dodge is right and this company is really a sound undertaking , my share of the deal will be # 10,000 .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 19]: It seems wildly incredible , yet my friends know what they are writing about as a rule . ''
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 9]: An hour later he was in the city .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 48]: A smart brougham stood in front of the now thoroughly renovated offices of Dodge , Son & Co. -LRB- Limited -RRB- , and out of it , at the moment the barrister detached himself from the chaos of Leadenhall Street , stepped the head of the firm .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 23]: He was making up the steps when Claude cried : `` Hello , Mr. Dodge , how is the junior partner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 23]: Dodge stopped , focussed Bruce with his sharp eyes , and smiled : `` Oh , it is you , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 10]: The young ` un is all right , thanks .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 6]: Are you coming in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 7]: `` That was my intention . ''
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 5]: `` Come along then .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 13]: I was hoping I would see you one of these days . ''
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 7]: `` Has business improved recently ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 10]: inquired Bruce , as they entered the inner office .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 12]: `` Yes , somewhat ; but money is very tight still .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 14]: However , we generally look for a spurt early in the New Year .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 6]: Why do you ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 5]: `` No valid reason .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 5]: A mere hazard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 14]: `` Was it because you saw me drive up in a carriage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 21]: `` Mr. Dodge , I never dreamt that self-consciousness was a failing of the members of the Stock Exchange . ''
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 9]: `` Then that _ was _ the cause .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 4]: I guessed it .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 27]: I have been making inquiries about you , Mr. Bruce , and there is no use in trying to fool you , not a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 10]: `` Have you another Springbok proposition on hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 6]: `` No ; bar chaffing .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 20]: You were the man who ferreted out the truth about that West Australian combination when everybody else had failed .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 21]: And , now I think of it , you made me talk a lot the last time you were here .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 6]: However , I am ready .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 3]: Fire away !
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 25]: I will tell you the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help me -- '' `` Sh-s-sh !
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 10]: Do not perjure yourself for the sake of alliteration .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 14]: Besides , it is I who have come to talk this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 5]: `` About Springboks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 39]: The people I mentioned to you at my previous visit are prepared to underwrite the shares , provided that their agent 's report is as favorable in its entirety as a telegraphic summary leads them to believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 3]: `` Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 5]: That 's good news !
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 11]: When will they be in a position to complete ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 12]: `` As soon as they hear from South Africa by post .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 5]: Say three weeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 4]: `` So long !
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 14]: But suppose I get an offer from some other quarter in the meantime ?
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 10]: I can not keep the proposal open indefinitely . ''
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 13]: `` I have not asked you to do so , Mr. Dodge .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 20]: Let me see -- three shillings per share on , say , two hundred thousand shares is # 30,000 .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 8]: It is a good deal of money .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 23]: If any one likes to hand you a cheque for that amount without preliminary investigation , take it by all means . ''
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 6]: The notion tickled Dodge immensely .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 7]: `` All right , Mr. Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 17]: When people of that sort turn up we do n't sell 'em Springboks in the City .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 15]: But there is no harm in you telling me your clients ' names . ''
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 6]: `` Not in the least .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 8]: They are the Anglo-African Finance Corporation . ''
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 4]: Mr. Dodge whistled .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 13]: `` By Jove , they 're the best backing I could have .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 16]: This is a good turn , Mr. Bruce , and I sha n't forget it .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 22]: You see , we 're a young firm , and association with well-known houses is good for us in every sense .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 11]: I 'm jolly glad now that Springboks are all right .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 17]: It would never have done for me to introduce them to a risky piece of business .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 8]: I am really much obliged to you .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 9]: And now , how do we stand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 5]: `` Kindly explain . ''
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 11]: `` How much ` com ' do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 4]: `` Nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 12]: Mr. Dodge moved his chair backward several feet in sheer amazement .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 7]: `` Nothing , my dear sir !
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 2]: Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 6]: It is a big affair .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 14]: Shall we say one per cent in cash , or two in shares .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 19]: I am not very well off just now , or -- '' `` Pray do n't trouble yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 16]: I have already secured my commission -- five per cent in fully paid shares . ''
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 20]: `` But the people who put up the money do n't pay for the privilege as a rule . ''
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 7]: `` That I know quite well .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 5]: This case is different .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 14]: I am not , nor ever have been , a financial go-between . ''
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 17]: `` Did n't you come to see me about the deal in the first instance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 8]: It was Bruce 's turn to hesitate .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 8]: `` Not exactly , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 21]: `` I really wanted to know something about Mr. Corbett , and the Springbok business arose out of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 7]: `` Ah , that chap Corbett .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 7]: I have been thinking about him .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 7]: I wonder who he can be ?
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 22]: Anyhow , I owe him my best wishes , as the mention of his name has had such excellent results . ''
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 12]: `` Well , that is all , '' said Bruce rising .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 5]: `` Yes , thanks .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 14]: I must now see about raising the money to pay my own call .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 12]: I am interested in fifty thousand shares , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 9]: `` Then you require some # 7,500 ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 18]: But that will be easy when I can say that the Anglo-African Finance people are with me .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 21]: Besides , this morning -- queer you should call immediately afterwards -- I have had some wholly unexpected news . ''
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 4]: `` Indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 15]: Mr. Dodge was in a talkative vein , and Bruce was in no hurry .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 6]: `` The very best ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 5]: went on Dodge gleefully .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 14]: `` You see , there is another man in this affair with me .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 42]: I thought he was as stony-broke as I am myself -- speaking confidentially , you know -- when he suddenly writes to me saying that he had won a pot of money at Monte Carlo and could spare me # 2,000 .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 5]: What 's the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 8]: Beastly trying weather , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 7]: Try a nip of brandy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 15]: For once in his life the self-possessed barrister had blanched at a sudden revelation .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 6]: But this was too much .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 12]: He felt as though a meteorite had fallen on his head .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 8]: Nevertheless , he grappled with the situation .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 3]: `` Ill !
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 3]: No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 6]: `` How stupid of me .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 7]: I have forgotten my morning smoke .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 7]: May I light a cigar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 4]: `` With pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 4]: You know these .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 4]: Try one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 11]: `` You were saying -- '' `` That 's all .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 19]: This young fellow , Mensmore his name is , got mixed up with me over a Californian mine .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 22]: I thought he had lots of coin , so when Springboks came along he and I went shares in underwriting them .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 11]: The public did n't feed , so we were loaded .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 18]: I tried all I knew to get him to pay up , but he absolutely could n't .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 15]: And now at the very moment affairs look promising he writes offering # 2,000 .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 25]: More than that , he says , if necessary , he can get the remainder of his half , # 1750 , from somebody .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 6]: Where is his letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 7]: Mr. Dodge looked on his table .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 7]: `` Oh , here it is .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 14]: Addressed from ` Yacht _ White Heather _ , ' if you please .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 5]: Quite swell , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 4]: Sir William Browne !
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 5]: That 's the covey .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 10]: I think I will let Sir William have 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 17]: It 's a good , solid sort of name to have on the share register . ''
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 18]: `` I would if I were you , '' said Bruce , hardly conscious of his surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 11]: `` If _ you _ think so , I will .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 12]: By Jove , this has been a good morning for me .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 6]: Come and have lunch . ''
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 5]: `` No , thanks .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 8]: I have a lot to attend to .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 10]: By the way , where did Mensmore live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 10]: His address was always at the Orleans Club . ''
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 10]: Somehow , Bruce reached the street and a hansom .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 23]: As the vehicle rolled off westward he crouched in a corner and tried to wrestle with the problem that befogged his brain .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 7]: Was Albert Mensmore Sydney H. Corbett ?
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 7]: Was he Mrs. Hillmer 's brother ?
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 17]: The `` Bertie '' she had spoken of meant Albert as well as a hypothetical Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 11]: Mensmore was an old schoolfellow of Sir Charles Dyke 's .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 10]: In all probability he knew Lady Dyke as well .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 20]: He lived in Raleigh Mansions under an assumed name , and quitted his abode two days after the murder .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 19]: Every circumstance pointed to the terrible assumption that at Mensmore 's hands the unfortunate lady met her death .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 9]: And Bruce had sworn to avenge her memory !
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 24]: He laughed with savage mirth as he reflected that he himself had helped this man to escape the punishment of Providence , self-inflicted .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 21]: It was , indeed , pitifully amusing to think how the clever detective had used his powers to befool himself .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 15]: The very openness of the clue had helped to conceal it the more effectually .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 26]: Were it not for Dodge and his Springboks he might have gone on indefinitely covering up the criminal 's tracks by his own friendly actions .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 7]: The situation was maddening , intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 24]: Bruce wanted to seize the reins and flog the horse into a mad gallop through the traffic as a relief to his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 24]: Blissfully unconscious of the living volcano he carried within , the cabby on the perch did not indulge in any such illegal antics .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 16]: He quietly drove along the Embankment and delivered his seething fare at his Victoria-street chambers .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 18]: Quite oblivious of commonplace affairs , the barrister threw a shilling to the driver and darted out .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 22]: The man gazed at his Majesty 's image with the air of one who had never before seen such a coin .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 15]: It might have been a Greek obolus , so utter was his blank astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 21]: But Bruce was across the pavement , and cabby had to find words , else it would be too late .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 20]: `` Here guv ` nor , '' he yelled , `` what the ballyhooley do you call this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 5]: was the impatient query .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 4]: `` Matter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 14]: The cabman looked towards the sky to see if the heavens were falling .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 4]: `` Matter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 12]: in a higher key , as a crowd began to gather .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 13]: `` I tykes him from Leaden ` all Street to Victoria . '
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 17]: E gives me a bob , an ' ' e arsks me wot 's the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 20]: I 'd been on the ranks four bloomin ' hours -- '' `` Oh , there you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 12]: and Bruce threw him half-a-crown before he disappeared up the steps .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 9]: Mr. White was watching for Bruce 's arrival .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 19]: He wondered why the barrister was so perturbed , and resolved to strike while the iron was hot .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 10]: So he , too , vanished into the interior .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 42]: CHAPTER XIII A QUESTION OF PRINCIPLE `` If any one calls , I am out , '' cried Claude to his factotum , as he crossed the entrance-hall of his well-appointed flat , and flung open the door of his library .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 31]: `` The guv ` nor 's in a tantrum , '' observed Smith to his wife , and he settled himself to renew the perusal of Grand National training reports .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 38]: He had just noticed the interesting fact that last year 's winner had `` jumped in for the last mile '' in a gallop given to a rank outsider , when the electric bell upset his calculations .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 24]: `` My master is out , '' he said , as he opened the door to find Mr. White standing on the mat .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 19]: He was about to close the door again , but the detective planted his foot against the jamb .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 11]: `` Your master is not out , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 10]: `` I saw him come in a minute since .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 10]: Tell him Mr. White wants to see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 6]: Smith 's dignity was superb .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 27]: `` My master may be hin , '' he cried , `` but ' e told me to say ' e was hout to callers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 5]: The aspirates supplied emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 22]: `` Tell him what I say at once , '' and Mr. White gave him his best `` accessory-after-the-crime '' glance .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 37]: `` I do n't see why I should , '' snarled Smith , but the squabble ended when Bruce 's voice was heard -- `` Show him in , Smith , but admit nobody else . ''
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 17]: With an air of armed neutrality Smith ushered the representative of Scotland Yard into the library .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 25]: `` You 're not looking very well , sir , '' said White , his round eyes fixed on Bruce with all their power .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 13]: `` Was it to ask about my health that you came ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 8]: `` No , sir , not exactly .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 33]: But I have n't seen you for quite a while , and as we are both interested in the same matter I thought I would look you up and compare notes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 7]: Bruce was annoyed by the interruption .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 13]: He wanted to think , not to be bothered by official theories .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 28]: He looked hard at Mr. White , wondering whether he should tell him all he knew and wash his own hands clear of the investigation in future .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 10]: But there was a second picture before his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 53]: He saw Phyllis Browne 's face , not as it was that day at the Tir aux Pigeons , but with the light of happiness in it , with the joyousness of requited and undisturbed love , with the glow reflected from dancing waves , and the tremulous smile of innocent pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 24]: It was hard to believe that such a woman could place her heartfelt trust in a man who was possibly a cold-blooded murderer .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 8]: Such a combination was unnatural and horrible .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 13]: Already Bruce was beginning to doubt the evidence of his analytical senses .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 23]: Mr. White meanwhile flattered himself by the thought that the other was trying to read his thoughts by looking at him fixedly .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 14]: `` I have been away from home , '' said Bruce at last .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 13]: `` I had occasion to go to the South of France . ''
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 5]: `` I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 6]: I was sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 12]: How do you manage always to get ahead of us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 9]: Mr. White was enthusiastic in his admiring divination .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 10]: `` You have heard about Sydney H. Corbett ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 15]: said the barrister , still keeping that inscrutable , calculating gaze upon the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 6]: I am on his track .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 13]: We may be slow , but we are sure in Scotland Yard .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 12]: May I ask what luck you have had , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 6]: `` In what respect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 15]: `` As if you did n't go to Monte Carlo to find Corbett yourself !
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 13]: Really , Mr. Bruce , the scent is too hot this time .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 17]: You might as well give a ` View halloa ' if you have seen him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 10]: `` Seen Sydney H. Corbett , you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 7]: `` That is the gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 11]: For an instant Mensmore 's future trembled in the balance .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 25]: Bruce almost framed the words which would have led to his immediate arrest at the next port touched by the _ White Heather _ .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 27]: But the memory of Phyllis Browne , of her agony , of the fearful scandal that must fly through Society on the Riviera , restrained him .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 5]: There was no hurry .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 7]: He must have time to think .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 30]: `` I certainly went to Monte Carlo to discover the identity of that interesting personage , but I came back , Mr. White , as wise as I went .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 20]: The only trace I found of him was an undelivered letter awaiting him at the Hotel du Cercle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 4]: `` A letter !
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 6]: Was n't he there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 14]: Mr. White 's face , notwithstanding its official decorum , betrayed its disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 6]: This was an unlooked-for check .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 6]: `` He had been there .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 14]: Other letters came for him earlier , and he had received them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 13]: `` But the hotel people -- '' `` Did not know him .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 24]: In fact , there can not be the slightest doubt that Mr. Corbett concealed his identity at Monte Carlo under another name . ''
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 12]: `` It does n't matter much , '' growled the detective .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 16]: `` We will nab him all the same , if he had fifty names . ''
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 3]: `` Possibly .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 22]: But it is wonderful how a man may be under your very nose , and yet you may miss him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 9]: During the next few minutes neither man spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 23]: Bruce smiled cynically at the thought that he was actually shielding Lady Alice 's probable slayer from the minions of the law .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 8]: He marvelled at himself for his irresolution .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 6]: Nevertheless , he would wait .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 7]: Mensmore could not escape him now .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 17]: Perhaps the business might be managed without the dramatic features which would accompany an immediate arrest .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 9]: And there were some things that required explanation .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 29]: If his Monte Carlo acquaintance really killed Lady Dyke , then he was the strangest criminal whom Bruce had ever encountered during the course of his varied career .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 6]: The policeman misinterpreted his expression .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 17]: `` You ca n't laugh at us this time , Mr. Bruce , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 12]: `` Scotland Yard and yourself evolved the same theory , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 17]: And we ca n't fly off to the South of France as readily as you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 9]: `` Your skill is profound , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 24]: Indeed , I wonder at it , considering the mysterious way in which the missing man left his address at the post-office . ''
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 4]: The other reddened .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 19]: `` That was simple enough , I know ; but we were on his track before that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 11]: `` By watching me when I visited his sister . ''
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 12]: `` You saw me outside the Jollity Theatre , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 6]: What did you expect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 6]: Mr. White recovered his placidity .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 13]: `` There 's no use quarrelling about it , '' he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 9]: `` I did get that wrinkle from you .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 34]: But how on earth were we to know what to do , when there were seventy-one flats occupied by respectable people , and one closed for months , the caretaker told us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 16]: `` I hope you have ceased your surveillance so far as I am concerned . ''
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 6]: `` Honor bright , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 7]: I wo n't do it again .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 13]: Besides , we must lay hands on Corbett sooner or later . ''
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 8]: `` What steps are you taking ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 9]: `` The Monte Carlo police are making inquiries .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 5]: They have his description .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 8]: It has also gone to America . ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 5]: `` Why America ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 8]: `` Because he spent some time there .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 10]: He only returned from the States early last year .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 21]: His sister has not seen him for years , and a rare old row they had when he turned up .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 26]: He had not much money , so she helped him , and he settled down for a time in the same mansions as herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 8]: `` Who told you all this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 14]: `` Mrs. Hillmer , and a precious lot of trouble she gave me .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 8]: She is a clever woman that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 16]: `` It was rather too bad to pester her about it , poor lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 10]: `` I only followed your lead , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 10]: This was so true that Claude changed the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 8]: `` What sort of man is Corbett ?
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 6]: Have you his description ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 5]: Here it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 33]: Mr. White produced a copy of the _ Police Gazette _ , a publication never seen by the public , but of a large circulation among the police of the United Kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 18]: The details were fairly accurate as to Mensmore 's personal appearance , but there was no photograph .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 12]: Oddly enough , Bruce was pleased on noting this serious deficiency .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 9]: `` You did not secure his picture ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 18]: Mrs. Hillmer declared that she had not a single photograph of her brother in her possession . ''
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 11]: `` Did she -- tell you his real name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 12]: the barrister had almost said , but he deflected the question .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 19]: `` Did she give you any hint as to a possible cause for this apparently unnecessary crime ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 6]: `` Not a word . ''
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 12]: `` Then you did not mention Lady Dyke to her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 31]: Sir Charles has always implored me to keep his wife 's name out of my inquiries until it became absolutely impossible to conceal it in view of a public prosecution .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 11]: He wants to know definitely when that time comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 9]: The detective did not reply for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 11]: When he spoke he leaned forward and subdued his voice .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 34]: `` I am as sure as I am sitting here , sir , that Sir Charles will not live if any disgrace should come to be attached to his wife 's memory . ''
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 11]: `` Do you mean that he will kill himself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 4]: `` I do .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 11]: He has changed a great deal since this affair happened .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 7]: He is not the same man .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 9]: He appears to be always mooning about her .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 18]: And people say that they were not so devoted to one another when she was alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 13]: Again did the barrister switch off their talk from an unpleasant topic .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 14]: `` This description of Corbett is not much use , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 16]: `` It applies to every athletic young Englishman of good physique and gentlemanly appearance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 4]: `` Quite true .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 18]: I do n't depend on that for his arrest , but it will be valuable for identification .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 19]: ` Blue eyes , light brown hair , fresh , clear complexion , well-modelled nose and chin . '
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 14]: Some of these things can be changed by tricks , but not all .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 21]: For instance , there would be no use in smoking a man with black eyes and irregular features . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 6]: ` Smoking ' him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 11]: `` Oh , that 's our way of putting it .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 7]: Following him , it means . ''
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 13]: `` Suppose the French police do n't succeed in catching him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 9]: `` We will get him at Raleigh Mansions .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 31]: He is sure to think that Lady Dyke 's fate has never been determined , and he will return when the inquiry has blown over , to all appearance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 20]: `` You have quite made up your mind , then , that Sydney H. Corbett is the murderer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 7]: `` It looks uncommonly like it .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 10]: At any rate , he knows something about it .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 15]: If not , why did he bolt to France two days after the crime ?
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 7]: Why has he concealed his identity ?
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 16]: Why does he take pains to receive his correspondence in the manner he has adopted ?
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 5]: And , by Jove !
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 18]: suppose he is n't in Monte Carlo at all , but in London all the time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 19]: The inspector glowed with his sudden inspiration , but Bruce kept him to the lower level of realities .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 11]: `` Corbett is , or was , in Monte Carlo .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 7]: Of that you may be sure .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 16]: He , and none other , got the letters sent to the Hotel du Cercle .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 18]: I can not for the life of me imagine why he did not take the last one .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 9]: But let us look at what we know .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 20]: Lady Dyke , we will say , went to Corbett 's chambers , secretly and of her own accord .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 8]: That may be taken as fairly established .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 30]: Thence there is a blank in our intelligence until she appears as a hardly recognizable corpse , stuffed by hands beneath an old drain-pipe in the Thames at Putney .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 12]: How do you fill up that gap , Mr. White ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 4]: `` Simply enough .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 16]: Corbett , or some other person , persuaded her to voluntarily accompany him to Putney .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 10]: She was killed there , and not in London .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 27]: It would be almost a matter of impossibility for any man to have conveyed her lifeless body from Raleigh Mansions to Putney without attracting some notice .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 9]: One man could _ not _ do it .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 27]: Several might , but it is madness to imagine that a number of people would join together for the purpose of killing this poor lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 9]: `` The seemingly impossible is often accomplished . ''
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 17]: `` Do you really believe , then , that she met her death in London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 12]: `` I have quite an open mind on the question . ''
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 25]: `` You forget that she had resolved early that day to visit her sister at Richmond , and Putney is on the direct road .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 13]: What more reasonable than to assume -- '' `` Beware of assumptions !
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 16]: You are assuming all the time that Corbett was a principal in her murder . ''
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 7]: `` Very well , Mr. Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 15]: Then I ask you straight out if you do n't agree with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 6]: `` I do not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 7]: This declaration astounded the barrister himself .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 12]: Often the mere utterance of one 's thoughts is a surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 21]: Speech seems to stiffen the wavering outlines of reflection , and the new creation may differ essentially from its embryo .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 9]: It was so with Bruce in this instance .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 37]: Ever since Mr. White 's arrival had aroused him from the positive stupor caused by the stock-broker 's unwitting revelation , Claude Bruce had been slowly but definitely deciding that Mensmore did not kill Lady Dyke .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 14]: He had seen him , unprepared , facing death as preferable to dishonor .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 11]: At such moments a man 's soul is laid bare .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 25]: With the shadow of a crime upon his conscience Mensmore 's actions could not have been so genuine and straightforward as they undoubtedly were .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 21]: Mensmore , of course , might in some way be bound up with the mystery surrounding Lady Dyke 's movements .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 16]: His very utterance in Bruce 's room at the Hotel du Cercle implied as much .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 5]: That was another matter .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 12]: It would receive his -LRB- Bruce 's -RRB- most earnest attention .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 23]: But the major hypothesis , so quickly jumped at by the police , needed much more substantiation than it had yet obtained .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 18]: That it was plausible was demonstrated by the barrister 's readiness to adopt it at the outset .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 22]: Even now that his impulse to fasten the crime on Mensmore had weakened he wondered at his eagerness to defend him .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 7]: The detective was even more surprised .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 16]: `` I do n't see how you can take that view , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 13]: `` Corbett 's behavior is , to say the least , unaccountable .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 15]: If he is an innocent man , then he must be a foolish one .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 9]: Besides , why should he necessarily be innocent ?
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 25]: This is the first gleam of light we have had in a very dark business , and I mean to follow it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 19]: The vindictive emphasis of his tone showed that the detective was annoyed at the other 's impassive attitude .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 38]: He even went so far as to dimly evolve a theory that the barrister wished to throw him off Corbett 's trail on account of his sympathy for Mrs. Hillmer , but Claude rapidly dispelled this notion .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 31]: `` You are here , I suppose , to ask my advice in pursuance of our understanding that we are working together in the matter , as it were ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 11]: `` Well , something of the kind , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 22]: `` Then I recommend that we see the inside of that closed flat in Raleigh Mansions at the earliest moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 10]: `` Do you mean by a search warrant ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 4]: `` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 11]: Do you want the whole neighborhood to know of it ?
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 11]: You have probably heard of locks being picked before to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 23]: You and I , and none other , must have a quiet look around the place without anyone being the wiser . ''
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 10]: Mr. White hesitated , but the prospect was attractive .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 15]: `` I think I can manage it , '' he said , smiling reflectively .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 8]: `` Will six this evening suit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 4]: `` Admirably . ''
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 9]: `` Then I will call for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 33]: After a parting glance at Smith , who returned it , nose in air , the inspector ran down the stairs , murmuring , `` Blest if I can understand Mr. Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 7]: But this is a good move .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 6]: We may learn something . ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 48]: CHAPTER XIV NO 12 RALEIGH MANSIONS When the door of Corbett 's or Mensmore 's flat swung open before the skilful application of a skeleton key , a gust of cold air swept from the interior blackness , and whirled an accumulation of dust down the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 30]: It is curious how a disused house seems to bottle up , as it were , an atmospheric accumulation which always seeks to escape at the first available moment .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 17]: Emptiness is more than a mere word ; it has life and the power of growth .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 20]: A residence closed for a week is less depressing than if it has not been inhabited for a month .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 19]: If the period of neglect be lengthened into a year , the sense of dreariness is magnified immeasurably .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 45]: In this instance , the mysterious abode might have been the abiding-place of disembodied spirits , so cold was its aspect , so uninviting the dim vista that sprung into uncertain vision under the flickering rays of a wax vesta struck by the detectives .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 12]: But neither the policeman nor his companion was a nervous subject .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 27]: They entered at once , closed the door by its latch , and , aided by other matches , found the switch of the electric light .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 8]: In this brighter radiance the indefinable vanished .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 52]: The flat became a cosy , fairly well appointed bachelor 's `` diggings , '' neglected and untidy , yet not without a semblance of comfort , which only needed the presence of a sturdy housemaid and a fire to be converted into the ordinary chambers with which the locality abounds .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 31]: Their first care was to draw down all the blinds , the neglect of which housewifely proceeding argued the careless departure of a mere male when the place was vacated .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 26]: A rapid preliminary survey followed , and drew from Bruce the remark : `` Furnished by a woman , but occupied by a man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 21]: Mr. White agreed , but he did n't know why , so he put a tentative question on the point .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 67]: `` Do n't you see , '' said Bruce , `` that the carpets match the upholstery of the furniture , that the beds have valances , that the spare bedroom for a guest is even more elaborate than that used by the tenant , that care has been taken in fitting up the kitchen , and taste displayed in the selection of pieces of bric-a-brac ?
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 8]: Only a woman attends to these things .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 57]: On the other hand , a card tray has been used as a receptacle for a cigar ash , the pictures -- no woman ever buys a picture -- have been picked up promiscuously from shops where they sell sporting prints , and the sides of the mantelpieces are chipped by having feet propped against them .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 12]: There are plenty of other signs , but these suffice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 15]: Thenceforth the two men devoted themselves to their task , each after his kind .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 82]: The representative of Scotland Yard hunted for documents , photographs , torn envelopes ; he looked at the covers of books to see if they were inscribed ; he opened every drawer , ransacked every corner , peered into the interior of jars , pots , and ovens ; appraised the value of furniture , noted its age , and was specially zealous in studying the appearance of the only bedroom which had been occupied so far as he could judge .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 27]: Bruce , having given a casual glance around , entered the sitting-room , selected the most comfortable chair , and proceeded to envelope himself in smoke .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 17]: He had not spent two minutes in Mensmore 's flat before he made a striking discovery .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 16]: The dwelling consisted of a central passage , dividing two equal portions from the other .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 16]: That on the right contained a drawing-room and a large bedroom , with dressing-room attached .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 17]: On the left were another bedroom , a dining-room , a kitchen , and a store-room .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 38]: At the end of the passage , which terminated in the transverse corridor , were the bathroom , a pantry , and a small room , empty now , but apparently designed for a servant 's bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 18]: The furniture , as has been stated , was good in quality and sufficient for its purposes .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 26]: But the fact which immediately impressed this skilled observer was that the arrangement of the sitting-room differed essentially from the other details of the flat .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 14]: The same care had not been taken in the disposition of the articles .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 15]: They had been dumped down anyhow , without taste or regard for suitable position .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 15]: The carpet had not been bought for this special apartment like the carpets elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 10]: A handsome ebony cabinet stood in the wrong place .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 35]: The blue china ornaments obviously intended to fill its shelves were littered about the mantelpiece or on small tables , while the Satsuma ware meant for the over-mantel was stiffly disposed on the cabinet .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 26]: Small matters these , but Bruce thought them more fruitful of accurate theory than the detective 's hunt for a written history of the crime !
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 11]: So , as he smoked , he mused and examined .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 15]: `` The drawing-room was the last place to be furnished , '' he thought .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 5]: `` The usual course .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 8]: It remained empty for some time probably .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 24]: The rest of the flat was arranged by a woman -- Mrs. Hillmer in all likelihood -- before the arrival of her brother .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 9]: Then he came and tackled the vacant room .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 14]: The history of the place is as plain as though I were present .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 25]: More than that , a woman -- Mrs. Hillmer again , let us say -- fixed upon these latter purchases , but without measurements .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 19]: She did not personally see to their adaptability , and she certainly did not supervise their final arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 6]: Now , why was that ?
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 14]: Again , these things are more worn than those in the other rooms .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 5]: Were they bought second-hand ?
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 5]: If so , why ?
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 8]: A woman thinks most of her drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 12]: It is the last place in which she would economize . ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 8]: Mr. White entered , anxious and puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 5]: `` Found anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 8]: inquired Claude , without looking at him .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 17]: `` Not a rag , not a piece of old newspaper with a date on it .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 24]: A lot of papers were burned in the kitchen grate , but from the remnants I judge that they were mostly bills . ''
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 11]: `` The place has been systematically cleared , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 7]: `` It looks like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 7]: `` Going to hunt here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 32]: You do n't seem to take much interest in the premises , Mr. Bruce , though you persuaded me to do a bit of house-breaking in order to get here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 12]: `` I find the quietude good for thought , Mr. White .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 14]: Be good enough not to make more noise than is absolutely necessary . ''
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 4]: The other sniffed .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 4]: He was disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 17]: He hoped for something tangible from this visit , and the outlook was far from promising .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 17]: `` This room appears to have been lived in a good deal , '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 11]: `` That is one way of looking at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 8]: `` Is there any other way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 22]: His voice snapped out the question as if he held the barrister personally responsible for his failure to gain a clue .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 17]: `` No , Mr. White , I should have guessed your point of view exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 8]: `` My point of view , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 14]: Do you want me to draw up another chair and light a pipe ?
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 9]: Should we be enlightened by tobacco smoke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 8]: `` I can not trust your tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 5]: Try a cigar . ''
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 15]: The detective angrily thumped a Chesterfield lounge to see if it betrayed aught suspicious .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 11]: At that instant Bruce 's glance rested on the fireplace .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 16]: The grate contained the ashes of a fire , -- a fire not long lighted .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 16]: This , combined with the undrawn blinds , argued a departure early in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 16]: `` He went to Monte Carlo by the day Channel service , '' mused Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 27]: `` He may have departed a few hours after Lady Dyke 's death , as Mrs. Hillmer was not certain as to the exact date . ''
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 7]: Somehow the few cinders attracted him .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 9]: They had , perchance , witnessed a tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 5]: Suddenly he stopped smoking .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 38]: He was so startled by something he had seen that the policeman must have noticed his agitation were not the detective at that instant intently screwing his eyes to peer behind the back of the elaborate cabinet .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 9]: On the hearth was a handsome Venetian fender .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 17]: Into each end was loosely socketed a beautifully moulded piece of ironwork to hold the fire-irons .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 21]: That on the left was whole , but from that on the right a small spike had been broken off .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 25]: By comparison with its fellow the missing portion was identical with the bit of iron found imbedded in the skull of the murdered woman .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 27]: Of this damning fact Bruce had no manner of doubt , though the incriminatory article itself was then locked in a drawer in his own residence .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 5]: He did not move .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 6]: He sat as one transfixed .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 8]: What a weapon for such a deed !
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 10]: Was ever more outlandish instrument used with murderous intent ?
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 22]: The entire bracket could easily be detached from the fender , and would , no doubt , inflict a terrible blow .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 15]: But why seize this clumsy device when it actually supported a heavy brass poker ?
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 15]: The thing savored of madness , of the wild vagary of a homicidal maniac .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 8]: It was incomprehensible , strange beyond belief .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 46]: Yet as Bruce pictured the final scene in that tragedy , as he saw the ill-fated lady stagger helplessly to the ground before a treacherous and crushing stroke , a fierce light leaped into his face , and his lips set tight with unflinching purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 21]: Had Mensmore been within reach at that moment he would assuredly have been lodged in a felon 's cell forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 10]: No excuse , no palliation , would be accepted .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 36]: The man who could so foully slay a gentle , kindly , high-minded woman deserved the utmost rigor of the law , no matter what the circumstances that led to the commission of the crime .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 14]: It was not often that Bruce allowed impulse to master reason so utterly .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 63]: In strange altruistic mood he asked himself why he did not spring from his chair , and , tearing the bracket from its supports , exhibit it to his fellow-worker , while he gave , in a few passionate sentences , the information that would set the French police to scour the Mediterranean littoral until they found the _ White Heather _ .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 14]: Of what matter to him was the suffering of a sister or sweetheart ?
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 12]: Did the man who killed Lady Dyke reck of these things ?
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 27]: Yes , he would do it -- But a cry of triumph from the detective arrested the fateful words even as they trembled on his lips .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 7]: `` Here 's a find ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 4]: was the shout .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 16]: `` Thinking is all very well , Mr. Bruce , but hard work is better .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 8]: What do you make of that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 46]: `` That '' was a letter , which , in the manner known to many a puzzled householder , had slipped down behind a drawer in the cabinet , to be crushed against the wardrobe at the back , and lie there forgotten and unnoticed .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 40]: Even in his perturbed state the barrister could not help glancing at the crumpled document , first noting the date , October 15th of the year just closed , with the superscription , `` Mountain Butts , Wyoming . ''
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 5]: There was no envelope .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 30]: It was addressed to `` Dear Bertie , '' and ran as follows : `` Your welcome note and its draft for fifty dollars came to hand last week .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 10]: My sisters and I can never forget your generosity .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 28]: We know you are hard up , and that you can ill spare these frequent gifts , or loans , as you are pleased to call them .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 27]: You and I have been in many a tight place , old chap , and I never knew you to fail either with hand or heart .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 41]: And when we drifted into this ranch , on my advice , and nearly starved to death , it was you who were bold enough to cut yourself adrift so that you might make something to keep the pot boiling .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 7]: `` But the tide is turning .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 16]: You know my failing ; this time I will try not to be too sanguine .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 10]: There have been big gold discoveries in this country .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 28]: It is now firmly believed that all our land is auriferous , and the scoundrel who sold us this beggarly ranch has tried to upset our title .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 14]: Thanks to your foresight , he was knocked out at the first round .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 10]: So I may soon have big news for you .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 15]: By Jove , wo n't it be a change if we both become rich !
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 11]: And wo n't we all have a time in Paris !
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 9]: However , I must not promise too much .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 9]: I have been taught caution by repeated failures .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 13]: Write by return , and say if this reaches you all right .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 11]: `` Your faithful friend , `` SYDNEY H. CORBETT . ''
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 9]: `` What do you think of that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 15]: cried the detective , when Bruce had slowly mastered the contents of the letter .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 3]: `` Think !
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 8]: I am too dazed to think . ''
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 12]: `` We can now learn all about him from America . ''
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 5]: `` About whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 8]: `` About Corbett , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 19]: `` Then did Corbett travel by the same mail as this letter in order to murder Lady Dyke ?
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 13]: It is dated October 15th , and she was killed November 6th .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 18]: It takes twelve days , at the quickest , for a letter to come here from Wyoming .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 26]: And Corbett , the writer of it , not the receiver , must have travelled in the same steamer , or its immediate successor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 23]: Mr. White 's face fell , but he stuck to his point : `` Anyhow , Corbett was here about that time .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 13]: I have seen the secretary to the company that owns these flats .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 11]: Corbett took the rooms for six months from September first .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 35]: When asked for references he gave his sister 's name , and as she banks with the National -- and she has always paid her rent for five years -- it was good enough .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 25]: Still , I must confess that Corbett could hardly be in Wyoming in October if he lived here in September and in November . ''
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 17]: The barrister answered between his set teeth : `` Yes , it is rather puzzling . ''
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 12]: `` Perhaps the letter was left there as a plant . ''
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 5]: `` An elaborate one .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 12]: It must have been conceived a month before the murder . ''
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 9]: `` But suppose it never came from Wyoming .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 12]: We have no proof that it was written in America . ''
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 10]: `` We have proof of nothing at present . ''
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 11]: `` Well , Mr. Bruce , have you a theory ?
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 14]: This is the place where you ought to shine , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 6]: `` I have no theory .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 17]: I must think for hours , for days , before I see my way clear . ''
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 8]: `` Clear to what , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 19]: `` To telling you how , when , and where to arrest the murderer of Lady Dyke . ''
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 12]: `` So this find of mine is of great importance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 3]: `` Undoubtedly .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 18]: I remember its contents sufficiently , but you will let me see it again if necessary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 6]: `` With pleasure , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 5]: And that reminds me .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 11]: You never returned that small bit of iron to me .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 12]: You recollect I lent it to you some time since . ''
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 3]: `` Perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 4]: Come with me .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 13]: I will model it in wax and give it to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 19]: `` All right , sir ; but as we are here I may as well continue my search .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 10]: I may drop on something else of value . ''
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 18]: Bruce resumed his seat , and did not stir until the detective had completely rummaged the cabinet .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 40]: The reading of that queer epistle from Corbett to `` Bertie '' -- from the real Simon Pure to the sham one -- from one man to his double -- had stopped him at the very threshold of disclosure .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 8]: The document impressed him as being genuine .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 26]: If so , who on earth was Corbett , and why had Mensmore taken his name , if that was the solution of the tangle ?
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 12]: Whatever the explanation , he would not jump to a conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 13]: The web had closed too securely round Mensmore to allow of escape .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 8]: Hence , Bruce could bide his time .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 14]: Another week might solve many elements in the case now indistinct and nebulous .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 4]: He would wait .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 13]: The detective finally satisfied himself there was nothing else in the cabinet .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 39]: He approached the fireplace , peered into every vase on the over-mantel , picked with his penknife at the back of the frame to feel for other letters , and in doing so several times kicked the fender .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 21]: The barrister vaguely wondered whether the man of method would note the missing portion of the iron `` dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 42]: `` Surely , '' he thought , `` he will see it now , '' as Mr. White bent to examine the ashes , and actually took the poker from the very support itself in order to rake among the cinders .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 27]: The other even scrutinized the fire-irons , but the too obvious fact that , so to speak , stared him in the face , escaped notice .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 23]: He was quite wrapped up in his theory that Lady Dyke had been killed at Putney , and not in Sloane Square .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 22]: At last he quitted the room , and walked off to the small apartments at the end of the main corridor .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 21]: Instantly Bruce sprang forward , fell on his knees , and intently examined the iron rest with a strong lens .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 12]: It bore no unusual signs in the locality of the break .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 16]: Taking some wax from his pocket , he took a slight impression of the fracture .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 25]: When Mr. White returned , he found the barrister sitting in his chair , still smoking , and with set face and fixed eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 16]: Soon afterwards they quitted the flat , carefully leaving all things as they found them .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 40]: They said little on their way to Victoria Street , for Bruce was trying to explain Mensmore 's attitude at Monte Carlo , and the detective was considering the best use to which he could put that all-important letter .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 12]: Besides , Mr. White attributed his companion 's silence to annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 33]: Had not he , White , laid hands on the only direct piece of evidence yet discovered as to Corbett 's identity , and this in defiance of Bruce 's spoken philosophy ?
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 16]: He could afford to be generous and not to worry his amateur colleague with questions .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 8]: Thus they reached the barrister 's chambers .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 22]: Bruce asked the other to sit down for a moment while he obtained a model of the small lump of iron .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 26]: He took it into his bedroom , fitted in into the wax impression obtained at Raleigh Mansions , and noted that the two coincided perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 11]: He handed the bit of iron to White without comment .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 69]: The latter said : `` It had better remain in my keeping now , sir , but if you want to see it again , of course I will be glad -- '' `` I shall never want it again , '' said Bruce , and his voice was harsh and cold , for he had seldom experienced such a strain as the last hours had given him .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 7]: `` It is an accursed thing .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 13]: It has caused one death already , and may cause others . ''
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 30]: `` I sincerely hope it will cause a man to be hanged , '' cried the detective , `` for this affair is the warmest I have ever tackled .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 26]: However , I 'll get him , as sure as his name 's Corbett , if he has forty aliases and as many addresses . ''
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 6]: Smith let Mr. White out .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 21]: The latter , halting for a moment at the door , said quietly , `` Is your name Corbett ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 14]: `` No , it ai n't , any more than yours is Black .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 3]: See ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 28]: Each man thought he had had his joke , so they were better friends thenceforth , but Mr. White was thoughtful as he passed into the street .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 11]: `` This is a funny business , '' he communed .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 23]: `` There is n't enough evidence against Corbett to hang a cat , yet I _ think _ he 's the man .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 7]: And Bruce is a queer chap .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 20]: Was he cut up about me finding the letter , or has he got some notion in his head .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 8]: He 's as close as an oyster .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 24]: I wonder if he _ did _ dine at Hampstead on the evening of the murder , as he said at the inquest ?
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 7]: I must inquire into it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 39]: CHAPTER XV MRS. HILLMER HESITATES `` I wonder if I shall have such exciting times to-day as I had yesterday , '' said Bruce to himself , as he unfolded his _ Times _ next morning at breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 22]: Affairs had so jumbled themselves together in his brain the previous evening that he had abandoned all effort to elucidate them .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 58]: He retired to rest earlier than usual , to sleep soundly , save for a vivid dream in which he was being tried for his life , the chief witnesses against him being Mrs. Hillmer , Phyllis Browne , and Jane Harding , the latter varying her evidence by entertaining the Court with a song and dance .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 8]: The weather , too , had improved .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 32]: It was clear , frosty , and sunlit -- one of those delightful days of winter that serve as cheerful remembrances during periods of seemingly interminable fog overhead and slush beneath .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 27]: During a quiet meal he read the news , and , with the invaluable morning smoke , settled himself cosily into an armchair to consider procedure .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 36]: In the first place he carefully weighed those utterances of Mensmore at Monte Carlo , which he could recall , and which seemed by the light of later knowledge , to bear upon the case .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 26]: Mensmore had alluded to `` family troubles , '' to `` worries , '' and `` anxieties , '' that practically drove him from England .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 13]: Some of these , no doubt , referred to the Springbok speculation .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 16]: Others , again , might have meant Mrs. Hillmer or some other presently unknown relative .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 29]: But in Mensmore 's manner there was nothing that savored of a greater secrecy than the natural reticence of a gentleman in discussing domestic affairs with a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 9]: This man had practically been snatched from death .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 44]: At such a moment it was inconceivable that he could cloak the remorse of a murderer by the simulation of more honorable motives , in themselves sufficiently distressing to cause him deliberately to choose suicide as the best way of ending his difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 21]: The policeman had summarized the testimony against Corbett as insufficient to curtail the remarkable powers of endurance of a cat .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 16]: But to Bruce the case against Mensmore , alias Corbett , stood in clearer perspective .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 57]: Now that he calmly reasoned the matter he felt that the balance of probabilities swung away from the hypothesis that Mensmore was the actual slayer of Lady Dyke , and towards the theory that he was in some way bound up with her death , whether knowingly or unknowingly it was at present impossible to say .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 9]: The new terror to Bruce was Mr. White .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 20]: `` Why , if that animated truncheon knew what I know of this business he would arrest Mensmore forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 8]: If he did , what would result ?
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 21]: A scandal , a thorough exposure , possibly the ruin of Mensmore 's love-making if he be an innocent man .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 5]: That must be stopped .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 8]: But how , without forewarning Mensmore himself ?
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 7]: -- and he may be guilty .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 19]: Chance may favor White , as it favored me , in disclosing the identity of the missing Corbett .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 9]: And what of the _ real _ Corbett ?
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 21]: What on earth has _ he _ got to do with it , and why has Mensmore taken his name ?
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 16]: If ever I get to the bottom of this business I may well congratulate myself .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 39]: The sole result of all my labor thus far may be summed up in a sentence -- I have not yet come face to face with the man whom I can honestly suspect as Lady Dyke 's murderer .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 7]: Not much , my boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 16]: Claude uttered the last sentence aloud , startling Smith , who was clearing the table .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 10]: `` Beg pardon , sir , '' cried Smith .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 5]: `` Oh , nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 8]: I was only expressing an opinion . ''
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 17]: `` I thought , perhaps , sir , you was thinkin ' of Mr. White . ''
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 6]: `` What of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 15]: `` Your remark , sir , hexactly hexpresses my hopinion of ` im . ''
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 26]: Smith was not a badly educated man , but the least excitement produced an appalling derangement of the letter `` h '' in his vocabulary .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 15]: `` Mr. White is a sharp fellow in his own way , Smith . ''
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 22]: `` Maybe , but why should ' e come pokin ' round ` ere pryin ' into your little affairs-deecur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 5]: `` My what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 18]: `` Sorry , sir , but that 's what a French maid I once knew called 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 4]: Flirtations , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 3]: Mashes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 9]: `` Smith , have you been drinking ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 6]: `` Me , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 6]: `` Well , explain yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 11]: I never flirted with a woman in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 11]: `` That 's what I told ` im , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 20]: ` My master 's a regular saint , ' says I , ' a sort of middle-aged ankyrite . '
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 14]: But Mr. White ' e would n't ` ave it at no price .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 20]: ` Come now , Smith , ' says ` e , ` your guv ` nor 's pretty deep .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 21]: ` E 's a toff , ' e is , an ' knows lots of lydies -- titled lydies . '
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 18]: ` Very like , ' says I , ` but ' e does n't mash 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 20]: ` Then what price that lydy who called for ` im in a keb afore ' e went away ?
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 13]: An ' who 's ' e gone to Monte Carlo with ? '
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 10]: This was durin ' your absence , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 6]: `` Go on , Smith .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 4]: Anything else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 32]: `` Well , sir , that rather flung me out of my stride , as the sayin ' is , as I _ ` ad _ seen the lydy in question .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 20]: An ' Mr. White ` as a nasty way of putting you on your oath , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 7]: But I never owned up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 3]: Claude laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 3]: `` Excellent .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 10]: Mr. White has a keen nose for false scents .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 11]: I have already told him to let my affairs alone .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 6]: He means no harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 22]: But the reference to a `` lydy in a keb '' had suggested an immediate plan of action to the barrister .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 8]: He would call to see Mrs. Hillmer .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 23]: He wrote a note asking her if he might come to tea that afternoon , and sent it by a boy messenger .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 7]: In return he received this answer .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 19]: `` Mrs. Hillmer will be at home at four o'clock if Mr. Bruce cares to call then . ''
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 4]: `` Whew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 3]: he whistled .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 8]: `` What 's in the wind there ?
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 7]: This is an uncommonly stiff invitation .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 12]: That rascal White has upset her , I 'll be bound .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 9]: I _ must _ choke him off somehow .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 9]: Suppose he were to find that damaged bracket !
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 14]: He would have Mensmore under trial at the Old Bailey in double-quick time .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 34]: After I leave Mrs. Hillmer I must visit No. 12 again , and carry off that pair of brackets before White discovers them , as he will haunt the place in future . ''
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 11]: Bruce had a set of skeleton keys in his possession .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 15]: They were in his pocket when he approached Raleigh Mansions at the appointed hour .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 16]: The same trim maid opened the door for him and ushered him into the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 14]: On the occasion of his first visit he was taken to the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 13]: It was a small matter , but Bruce paid heed to such .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 9]: Mrs. Hillmer appeared , very stately and undemonstrative .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 38]: She greeted him coldly , seated herself at a distance , and said , in a cold , well-controlled voice : `` I did not expect the honor of another visit from you , Mr. Bruce . ''
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 15]: There was a fight brewing , and he would let the enemy open fire .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 15]: The glitter in her eyes showed that the batteries were ready to be unmasked .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 5]: He was not mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 4]: `` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 9]: Because I believed you to be a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 23]: Once you had stooped to sending your myrmidons to pester me I imagined that you would keep yourself in the background . ''
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 12]: There was an indignant ring in her words as she concluded .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 17]: When a woman is angry her own speech acts as a trumpet-call and fires her blood .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 12]: Mrs. Hillmer began , as she intended , in icy disdain .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 6]: She ended in tremulous anger .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 8]: `` You allude to Mr. White ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 9]: said the barrister , looking steadily at her .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 8]: `` Yes , that is the man .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 6]: Some hireling from Scotland Yard .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 15]: How _ could _ you so meanly induce my confidence at our first meeting ?
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 25]: I have never been so deceived in a man in my life , and I have had a surfeit of bitter experience already . ''
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 7]: `` Brother and sister are alike .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 10]: They have led queer lives , '' mused Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 23]: Aloud he said : `` Your experience , Mrs. Hillmer , should at least lead you not to condemn any one unheard .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 13]: May I explain that which is to you incomprehensible at this moment ?
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 8]: -- justly so , I admit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 3]: `` Explanations !
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 12]: I am a child in the hands of such as you .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 10]: How can I hope to fathom your real intent ?
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 23]: Presumably , if I accept your apologies now , it will be a prelude to further visits by impudent police officers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 12]: `` I am not here to apologize , Mrs. Hillmer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 7]: `` What then , pray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 6]: `` To plead with you .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 11]: For Heaven 's sake do not distrust _ me _ .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 9]: It may ruin those whom you hold dear .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 13]: Listen to me first , and try to believe me afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 23]: He was so thoroughly in earnest , so impressive in manner , that she did not know what to make of him .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 18]: In her despair , she adopted a woman 's chief resource -- her eyes filled with tears .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 5]: But he anticipated her .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 18]: `` Now , Mrs. Hillmer , '' he cried , `` let us act like sensible people .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 20]: Compose yourself , order in some tea , and after an interlude I will tell you all about it .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 9]: Candor is an indispensable element of confidence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 24]: Mrs. Hillmer rose , made an effort to choke back her agitation , went out , and called to the maid for tea .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 7]: She returned in a few moments .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 29]: When they were alone Bruce said , with a smile : `` A little _ poudre de ris _ is an excellent corrective for signs of grief . ''
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 16]: The lady blushed , and there was a perceptible return to her former pleasant manner .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 12]: `` You are incorrigible , I fear , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 5]: `` Not a bit .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 4]: Impressionable , rather .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 14]: Now , I am going to startle you considerably , so be prepared .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 7]: And do not jump at conclusions .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 9]: Though startling , my news is not alarming .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 7]: All may yet end well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 21]: Mrs. Hillmer was manifestly anxious , but she promised to try to understand him fully before she formed any judgment .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 21]: `` Then , '' said he , `` I can clear the air a good deal by a simple statement .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 23]: Mr. White is no agent of mine , and I have seen your brother , Albert Mensmore , at Monte Carlo . ''
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 9]: Mrs. Hillmer gave a little gasp of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 7]: `` You have seen Bertie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 11]: `` Yes ; your brother , is he not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 8]: `` My half-brother , to be exact .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 6]: My father was married twice .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 14]: I -- I am the elder of the two by four years . ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 12]: `` Apart from the compliment , you do not look it .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 14]: But what you say explains the total absence of likeness between you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 3]: `` Possibly .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 8]: People said we each resembled our mother .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 13]: And Bertie , you know , has led a somewhat adventurous career .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 9]: He roughed it a good deal in America .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 22]: But what has all this got to do with detectives , and recent inquiries , and that sort of thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 3]: `` Much .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 23]: The last time we met I told you that your brother was mixed up in some little affair with a lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 8]: Mrs. Hillmer laughed , a trifle constrainedly .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 19]: `` If you knew Bertie as well as I do , you would not harbor suspicions concerning him .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 10]: He never had a love affair in his life .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 10]: Indeed , he is something of a woman-hater . ''
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 6]: `` No doubt he was .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 7]: But he has changed his opinions .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 17]: He is in love , and is engaged to be married to a very charming girl .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 16]: Thus far , his beliefs and his good fortune have pulled against each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 7]: `` Bertie engaged to be married !
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 3]: Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 4]: Who is she ?
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 8]: And how can he support a wife ?
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 19]: He is poor , and in debt , and he wo n't even let me help him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 9]: `` I have stated the facts , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 24]: The lady is a daughter of Sir William Browne , and they are now yachting with a large party in the Mediterranean . ''
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 8]: `` Are her people against the match ?
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 10]: Is that why this Scotland Yard man -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 9]: Mensmore is on board Sir William 's yacht .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 41]: But there is another lady , missing from her home for nearly three months , who is believed to be dead -- murdered , the police say -- and with whom your brother was in some indefinable way associated . ''
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 12]: `` Do they dare to say that Bertie killed her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 12]: Mrs. Hillmer 's color rose and her eyes flashed fire again .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 5]: `` They say nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 13]: They are simply doing their duty in trying to discover the truth .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 32]: And you may take it from me , as an undoubted fact , that the last place this lady visited before her death was one of the flats in these mansions .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 14]: All present indications point to your brother 's residence as being that place .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 32]: Now , I pray you , be calm , and try to help me , for I have acted in this matter as your friend and as your brother 's friend .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 28]: At this very moment I am concealing his identity and his whereabouts from the police , who are searching for him under the assumed name of Corbett .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 30]: If he is guilty of this crime , then I must hand him over to justice , for the murdered woman was a dear and good friend of mine .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 39]: If he is innocent , as , indeed , I believe him to be , I will strive to help him and save his good name from the tarnish of being arrested on such an odious charge . ''
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 9]: During this recital Mrs. Hillmer became deathly pale .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 12]: Her agitation was the greater inasmuch as she forcibly controlled herself .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 7]: But she could not remain seated .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 24]: She sprang to the window and looked out , in the vain effort to seek inspiration from the gathering gloom of the street .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 15]: Then she turned , and spoke very slowly : `` I think I understand .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 10]: I must have faith in you , Mr. Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 8]: Who -- was -- the lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 7]: The barrister thought deeply before replying .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 18]: He had previously decided upon this supreme step , but he hesitated now that it was imminent .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 7]: There was no help for it .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 19]: `` Her name , '' said he , `` is one which is well known to the world .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 22]: Lady Dyke , wife of Sir Charles Dyke , is missing from her home since the evening of November 6 last .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 32]: She met with a violent death that night , and I -- not the police -- have good reason to believe that she was killed in your brother 's residence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 31]: Mrs. Hillmer flung herself on a lounge , buried her white face in her hands and moaned , in a perfect agony of terror : `` Oh , my God !
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 5]: What shall I do ?
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 6]: What shall I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 5]: This outburst astounded Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 10]: He did not know what to make of it .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 10]: His intelligence had certainly taken his hearer by surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 14]: What interpretation was he to place upon her words and her unrestrained actions ?
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 34]: `` Now , Mrs. Hillmer , '' he began ; but she broke in vehemently , running to him and clutching him by the arm : `` He is innocent , Mr. Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 7]: He _ must _ be innocent .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 10]: He could not lift his finger to any woman .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 9]: You must save him -- do you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 14]: -- save him , or you will have his blood on your soul .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 17]: It _ was _ true , then , that you came here to hunt for him .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 15]: Save him , if you hope for mercy yourself when you are dying . ''
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 32]: In her passion she shook him violently , and for an instant they looked intently at each other -- the woman tensely piteous , entreating ; the man amazed and questioning .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 20]: `` Do you not see , '' he said at last , `` that your vehemence reveals your thoughts ?
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 16]: For anything you know to the contrary , your brother may have committed the crime .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 19]: Nay , it requires but slight knowledge of human nature to read your suspicions lest it be true .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 23]: At this moment I am convinced that you are , in your heart , less sceptical than I of his guilt . ''
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 25]: Mrs. Hillmer flung herself again upon the lounge , silent , tearful , torn with violent emotion , which she vainly tried to suppress .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 7]: He tried to reason with her .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 28]: `` It will , perhaps , serve to clear up a mystery that deepens each moment if you place your trust in me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 24]: `` Tell me fully and openly any cause you may have for fearing that your brother may be implicated in this terrible business .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 11]: I ask you to adopt this course in all faith .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 41]: I have seen your brother under most trying circumstances ; I have been with him at an hour when it would be impossible for him to conceal his burden if the weight of Lady Dyke 's death lay upon him .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 6]: Yet I think him innocent .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 12]: I think that chance has contributed to gather evidence against him .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 27]: If I can learn even a portion of the truth it will enable me to quickly dispel the barrier of uncertainty that now hinders progress . ''
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 10]: `` What is it you want to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 9]: Mrs. Hillmer 's voice was hollow and broken .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 26]: The barrister was shocked at the effect of his revelation , but he was forced to go on with the disagreeable task he had undertaken .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 18]: `` Do you mean , '' he asked , `` that you will answer my questions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 8]: `` So far as I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 20]: `` Would it not be better to tell me in your own words what you have to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 17]: Mrs. Hillmer looked up , and the agony in her face filled him with keen pity .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 13]: `` Oh , Heaven help me to do what is right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 8]: `` Your prayer will surely be answered .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 6]: I am certain of that .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 22]: A great wrong has been committed by some one , and the innocent must not suffer to shield the guilty . ''
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 15]: Mrs. Hillmer bowed her head and did not utter a word for some minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 15]: She appeared to be reasoning out some plan of action in a dazed fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 19]: When decision came she said in low tones : `` You must leave me now , Mr. Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 5]: I must have time .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 11]: When I am ready I shall send for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 12]: He knew instinctively that it was hopeless to plead with her .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 18]: Frivolous , volatile women of her stamp often betray unusual strength of character in a supreme crisis .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 13]: `` You are adopting an unwise course , '' he said sadly .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 3]: `` Maybe .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 6]: But I must be alone .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 6]: I am not deceiving you .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 19]: When I have determined something which is not now clear to me , I will send for you .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 8]: It may be that I shall speak .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 9]: It may be that I shall be silent .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 12]: In either case I only can judge -- and suffer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 15]: `` Tell me one thing at least , Mrs. Hillmer , before we part .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 12]: Did you know of Lady Dyke 's death before to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 20]: She came to him and looked him straight in the face , and said : `` I did not .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 9]: On my soul , I did not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 42]: Then he passed into the hall ; and even the shock of this painful interview did not prevent him from noting the flitting of a shadow past a distant doorway , as some one hurried into the interior of a room .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 20]: In their excitement they forgot that their voices might attract attention , and ladies ' maids are proverbially inquisitive .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 20]: CHAPTER XVI FOXEY The keen , cold air of the streets soon restored the man to his habitual calm .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 11]: He felt that a quiet stroll would do him good .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 24]: As he walked he pondered , and the more critically he examined Mrs. Hillmer 's change of attitude the less he understood it .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 18]: `` For some ridiculous reason , '' he communed , `` the woman believes her brother guilty .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 12]: Now I shall have endless trouble at getting at the truth .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 6]: She will not be candid .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 21]: She will only tell me that which she thinks will help him , and conceal that which she considers damaging .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 12]: That is a woman 's way , all the world over .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 8]: And a desperately annoying way it is .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 14]: Perhaps I was to blame in springing this business too hastily upon her .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 3]: But there !
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 18]: I like Mrs. Hillmer , and I hate using her as one juggles with a self-conceited witness .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 10]: In future I shall trouble her no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 41]: A casual glance into the interior of Sloane Square Station gave him a glimpse of the barrier , and he recognized the collector who had taken Lady Dyke 's ticket on that fatal night when she quitted the Richmond train .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 16]: Rather as a relief than for other cause he entered into conversation with the official .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 7]: `` Do you remember me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 11]: `` Ca n't say as I do , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 9]: The man examined his questioner with quick suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 14]: The forgotten `` season '' dodge would not work with _ him _ .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 7]: `` Maybe you remember these ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 7]: said Bruce , producing his cigar-case .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 9]: `` Now , wot 's the gyme ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 6]: said the collector to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 20]: But he smiled , and answered : `` Do you mean by the look of 'em , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 4]: `` Good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 3]: laughed Claude .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 9]: `` Take three or four home with you .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 33]: Meanwhile I am sure you remember me coming to see you last November concerning a lady who alighted here from Victoria one foggy evening and handed you a ticket to Richmond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 8]: `` Of course I do , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 9]: And the cigars are _ all _ right .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 10]: There was a lot of fuss about that lydy .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 7]: Did she ever turn up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 4]: `` Not exactly .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 14]: That is to say , she died shortly after you saw her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 8]: Well , of all the rummy goes !
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 16]: She was a fine-looking woman , too , as well as I rec ` llect .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 7]: Looked fit for another fifty year .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 8]: Wot ` appened to ` er . ''
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 6]: I wish I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 19]: `` An ' ` ave you been on the ` unt ever since , guv ` nor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 7]: `` Yes , ever since . ''
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 11]: `` She 's dead , you s ` y ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 22]: `` But ` ow 'd you know she 's dead , if you ` ai n't seen ` er since ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 6]: `` I have seen her .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 9]: I saw her dead body at Putney . ''
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 4]: `` At Putney !
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 7]: Well , I 'm blowed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 29]: A roar from beneath , the slamming of many doors , and the quick rush of a crowd up the steps , announced the arrival of a train .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 18]: `` Pardon , sir , '' said the man , `` this is the 5.41 Mansion House .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 20]: But do n't go aw ` y. There 's somethin' -- Tickets , _ if _ you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 10]: In a minute the collector had ended his task .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 18]: While sorting his bundles of pasteboards he said : `` Nobody ever tell 'd me that before .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 13]: An ' you ai n't the only one on ` er track .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 7]: Are you in the police ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 5]: `` I thought not .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 10]: But some other chaps who kem ` ere was .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 11]: None of 'em ever said the lydy was dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 7]: `` Why ; what matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 25]: `` Oh , nothin ' , but two ` eads is better 'n one , if they 're only sheep 's ` eads . ''
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 3]: `` Undoubtedly .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 20]: The rule is all the more reliable when one of them belongs to a shrewd chap like you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 4]: The collector grinned .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 16]: He understood that he was being flattered for a purpose , yet he liked it .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 42]: `` That 's one w ' y of lookin ' at it , '' he said , `` but if this affair 's pertickler , why , all I can s ' y is it 's worth somethin' to somebody . ''
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 8]: Here 's a sovereign for a start .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 18]: If you can tell me anything really worth knowing I will add four more to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 8]: `` Now , that 's talkin ' .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 27]: I 'm off duty at eight o'clock , an ' I ca n't ` ave a chat now because I expect the inspector any minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 14]: `` Suppose you call and see me in Victoria Street at nine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 8]: `` Right you are , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 11]: Bruce gave the man his address and recrossed the square .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 25]: Few people were abroad , so he walked straight to the first door of Raleigh Mansions and made his way to the fourth floor .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 22]: Had he been a moment later he must have seen Mrs. Hillmer , closely wrapped up , leave her residence unattended .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 7]: Her carriage was not in waiting .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 19]: She walked to the cabstand in the square and called a hansom , driving back up Sloane Street .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 31]: Her actions indicated a desire to be unobserved even by her servants , as in the usual course of events the housemaid would have brought a cab to the door .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 20]: But the barrister , steadily climbing up the stairs , could not guess what was happening in the street .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 25]: He soon opened Mensmore 's door , and noted , as an idle fact , that the expected gust of cold air was absent .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 21]: There was no light on this landing , so he was in pitch darkness once he had passed the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 30]: There was no need to strike a match , however , as he remembered the exact position of the electric switchboard -- on the left beyond the dining-room door .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 16]: He stepped cautiously forward , and stretched forth his hand to grope for the lever .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 52]: With a quick rush , some two or three assailants flung themselves upon him , and after a fierce , gasping struggle -- for Bruce was a strong man -- he was borne to the floor face downwards , with one arm beneath him and the other pinioned behind his back .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 12]: `` Look sharp , Jim , '' shouted a breathless voice .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 10]: `` Turn on the light and close the door .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 8]: We 've got him safe enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 3]: They had .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 39]: Two large hands were clutched round his neck , a knee was firmly embedded in the small of his back , another hand gripped his left wrist like a vice , while some one sat on his legs .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 14]: He could not have been collared more effectually by a Rugby International team .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 12]: The third man found the electric light and turned it on .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 21]: `` Now , get up , '' said some one , `` and do n't give us any more trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 6]: It 's no use . ''
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 18]: The barrister , who had had his wind knocked out of him , rose to his knees .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 25]: Then , as the light fell upon the horrified face of Mr. White , he vainly essayed to keep up the pretence of indignation .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 12]: Once fairly on his feet , he nearly collapsed with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 21]: He leaned against the wall , and , as his breath came again , he laughed until his sides ached .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 10]: Meanwhile the detective was crimson with rage and annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 13]: His two assistants did not know what to make of the affair .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 8]: `` What 's wrong , Jim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 5]: said one at last .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 7]: `` Is n't this Corbett ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 15]: `` No , of course it 's not , '' was his angry growl .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 9]: `` Then who the -- is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 7]: `` Oh , ask me another !
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 23]: How on earth could I guess , Mr. Bruce , that you 'd come letting yourself in here with a latchkey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 23]: Claude was still holding his sore ribs and could not answer ; but the policeman who had questioned White caught the name .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 10]: He recognized it , and grinned at his companion .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 10]: `` What did you want here , anyhow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 27]: snarled the infuriated detective , as he realized that his great _ coup _ would be retailed with embellishments through every police station in the metropolis .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 14]: `` I w-wanted you to ar-r-rest me , W-White , '' roared Claude .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 11]: `` I s-said you would , and you have . ''
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 13]: `` Confound it , how could you know I was here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 19]: `` You were sure to wait here for a man who probably will not return for months . ''
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 6]: `` Was I , indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 12]: Well , you have yourself to blame if you are hurt .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 12]: I hope my mates did not treat you too badly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 9]: cried the one who had not yet spoken .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 20]: `` He gave me such a punch on the bread-basket that I 've only just recovered my speech . ''
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 21]: `` I think we 're about quits , '' said the other , surveying a torn waistcoat and broken watch-chain .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 24]: `` I shall be black and blue all over to-morrow , '' said Bruce ; `` but if you are satisfied I am .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 17]: Come , Mr. White , bring your friends and we will open a bottle of wine .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 5]: We all want it .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 7]: Corbett wo n't be here to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 8]: Just now he is in Wyoming . ''
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 7]: `` How do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 4]: `` By intuition .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 6]: I am seldom mistaken . ''
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 16]: `` But why did n't you call out just now when you came in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 7]: `` I had n't a chance .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 10]: You were on me like a thousand of bricks .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 18]: I must confess that if Corbett were in my shoes he would be a doomed man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 11]: White did n't know whether to believe Bruce or not .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 43]: He was genuinely angry at the incident , but the barrister did not want to convert him into an enemy , and he vaguely felt that a catastrophe was imminent , and a false move by the police might do irretrievable mischief .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 24]: `` Well , inspector , '' he said , `` I must confess that this time you have got the better of me .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 8]: I did not know you were here .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 28]: I looked in for the purpose of quietly studying the ground , as it were , and I was never more taken by surprise in my life .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 24]: Moreover , your plan was a very clever one , in view of the fact that Corbett might return at any moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 25]: The detective became more amiable at this praise from the famous amateur , for Bruce 's achievements were well known to his two colleagues .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 16]: `` I suppose you wondered what had happened , '' he said with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 9]: `` I thought my last hour had come .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 14]: I am only sorry that Corbett himself did not have the experience . ''
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 14]: `` Do you really believe he is in the States , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 8]: `` I am sure of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 14]: `` Then he must have returned there since he wrote that letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 11]: `` That is the only solution of the difficulty . ''
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 3]: `` Hum .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 6]: It 's a pity . ''
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 12]: `` I would sooner prefer to arrest him on this side .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 20]: To get him by extradition is a slow affair , and probably means a trip across the Atlantic . ''
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 54]: Good-humor being now restored , the party quitted the flat and adjourned to a neighboring hotel , where the barrister started White on the full , true , and particular account of his pursuit and capture of the Winchmore Hill burglars , an exploit which was the pride of the detective 's life .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 29]: At the end of a bottle of champagne and a cigar they all parted excellent friends , but Bruce did not attempt to revisit Raleigh Mansions that night .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 25]: Instead , he partook of a quiet meal at a restaurant , and hurried to his chambers to await the advent of the ticket-collector .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 21]: Punctual to the hour , this new witness arrived , and was admitted by Smith in obedience with previous instructions .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 26]: The man was somewhat awed by the surroundings and the appearance of a servant in livery , but Bruce quickly put him at his ease .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 8]: `` Come , sit near the fire .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 7]: Do you drink whisky and soda ?
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 7]: That box contains your favorite cigars .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 12]: Now , tell me all you know about this business . ''
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 33]: `` I ca n't s ' y as I know anythink about it , sir , but by puttin ' two and two together it makes four sometimes -- not always . ''
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 4]: `` Quite right .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 5]: You 're a philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 8]: Let me hear the two two 's .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 9]: We will see about the addition afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 15]: `` Well , sir , this yer lydy was a-missin ' early in November .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 67]: She tykes a ticket at Victoria Station on the District for Richmond ; she gives it up to me at Sloane Square , arsks a newsboy the w ' y to Raleigh Mansions , for ' e tell 'd me so after you 'd bin to see me , an ' from what you s ` y , ` as bin swallered up ever since . ''
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 13]: `` The Lord Chief could n't state the case more simply . ''
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 7]: `` That 's the first two .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 37]: Now , for the second two , an ' you wo n't forgit as I knew nothink about the lydy bein ' dead , or I should ` ave opened my mouth long afore this . ''
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 4]: `` Go on .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 7]: No one can blame you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 46]: `` There 's an old chap -- Foxey they calls ` im , but I do n't know ` is right nyme -- who drives a four-wheeler around Chelsea , an ' ' e ` ad tyken a fare from the Square to the City .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 56]: It might be four o'clock or it might be five , but ' e was on ` is w ' y back from Cornhill when a gent , a tall , good-looking gent , a youngish , military chap , ` ails ` im and says : ` Cabby , drive me to Sloane Square .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 16]: There 's no ` urry , but tyke care , because it 's foggy . '
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 17]: Old Foxey nearly jumped out of ` is skin at this bit of good luck . '
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 36]: E was pretty full then , for ` e 's a regular beer-barrel , ' e is , but ' e made up ` is mind to ` ave a fair old skinful that night .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 12]: Well , Foxey drives ` im all right to the Square .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 19]: The gent gives ` im five bob and says : ` Wite ` ere for me , cabby .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 14]: You can drive me ` ome in about an hour 's time . '
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 5]: This was at 5.30 .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 31]: Foxey drew up near the stytion , tells me all about it , an ' stan 's me two beers , ' e was that pleased with ` isself . '
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 27]: E goes to give ` is ` oss the nose-bag , in comes the Richmond train , and out pops the lydy with the Richmond ticket .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 5]: D'ye follow me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 5]: `` Every word . ''
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 18]: `` An ' you see now ` ow it is I can fix the d' y ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 4]: `` Perfectly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 10]: `` Well , I sees no more of Foxey .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 25]: I missed ` im about the Square , so one d' y I axes at the rank , -- ` Where 's Foxey ? '
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 10]: An ' where d'ye think ' e was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 7]: `` I can not tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 5]: `` In quod . ''
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 4]: `` In jail .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 5]: `` That 's hit .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 8]: That 's number two of the twos .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 12]: Pardon me , but I 'm gettin ' a bit mixed .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 28]: Well , it seems that that very night , comin ' back from Putney as drunk as a lord , old Foxey runs over a barrer . '
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 10]: E an ' the coster ` as a fight .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 18]: The police come , and Foxey dots one bobby in the blinkers and another on the boko .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 11]: You would n't think it was in ` im . '
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 8]: E must ` ave bin paralytic . ''
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 8]: `` So he was locked up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 5]: `` Locked up ! '
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 9]: E was dragged there by the ` eels .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 10]: Next mornin ' ' e comes before the beak .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 16]: ` We was all drunk together , your wurshup , ' ' e says . '
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 24]: I took a fare from the City to Sloane Square , an ' ' e left me for more 'n an hour . '
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 47]: E comes back excited like -- bin boozin ' ` ard , I suppose -- brings my keb up to a ` ouse , carries in a lydy who was that ` toxicated she could n't stand , an ' tells me to drive to Putney .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 22]: We gits there , an ' I says ` you 've nearly killed my ` oss , guv ` nor . '
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 17]: With that ' e tips me a fiver -- a five-pun note , your wurshup . '
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 12]: ` What has that got to do with the charge ? '
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 4]: says the beak .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 4]: ` Wot ? '
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 3]: says Foxey .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 22]: ` If a chap give you a fiver for drivin ' ` im to Putney would n't you get drunk ? '
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 37]: With that the magistrate gives ` im three months for assaulting the police , and fines ` im the balance of the fiver for bein ' drunk in charge of a ` oss and keb . ''
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 11]: The ticket collector took a long drink after this recital .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 18]: `` I hope you will not follow Foxey 's example , '' said Bruce , rising . ''
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 9]: ` Ow do you mean , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 10]: `` Because I am going to keep my word .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 9]: Here are the four sovereigns I owe you .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 12]: In your case your two and two have made five . ''
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 6]: `` Thank you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 5]: You 're a brick .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 10]: No fear of me meltin ' this little lot .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 17]: The missus will be on 'em like a bird w ` en I tell her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 15]: And the man spat upon the coins with evident relish as he handled them .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 9]: `` One word more , '' said Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 8]: `` Where was this man tried ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 9]: `` At the West London Police Court . ''
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 15]: `` You can get me his real name and post it to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 5]: `` Sure , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 7]: Anyway , I 'll try . ''
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 9]: `` I am greatly obliged to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 17]: `` An ' ` as my yarn bin of any use to you , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 4]: `` The greatest .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 6]: It has solved a puzzle .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 8]: However , I will see you again .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 2]: Good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 7]: Do n't forget to write . ''
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 19]: `` Cornhill is the direct line from Leadenhall Street , '' mused Claude , when he was alone .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 18]: `` Any one coming to Sloane Square from Dodge & Co. 's office would pass through it .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 11]: Upon my word , things look very black against Mensmore .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 8]: Yet I can not believe it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 14]: CHAPTER XVII A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION Bruce now had several lines of inquiry open .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 36]: Apart from the main and vital question as to the exact method of Lady Dyke 's death , and the identity of the person responsible for it , a number of important matters required attention .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 10]: Why had Jane Harding quitted her situation so suddenly ?
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 17]: Whence did she obtain the money that enabled her to blossom forth as Marie le Marchant ?
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 6]: Who was Sydney H. Corbett ?
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 21]: Why did Mensmore adopt a false name ; and , in any case , why adopt the name of Corbett ?
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 15]: Why did Mrs. Hillmer exhibit such sudden terror lest her brother might be guilty ?
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 6]: Whom did Mrs. Hillmer marry ?
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 7]: Was her husband alive or dead ?
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 20]: Was the man who conveyed Lady Dyke 's body from Raleigh Mansions to Putney responsible also for her death ?
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 21]: Finally , why did he select that particular portion of the Thames banks for the bestowal of his terrible burden ?
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 29]: Many other minor features suggested themselves for careful attention , but the barrister knew that if he elucidated some of the major questions the rest would answer themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 18]: The last query promised to yield a good crop of information should it be satisfactorily dealt with .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 28]: Turning to his notes , he found that the former owner of the Putney house was a tutor or preparatory schoolmaster , named the Rev. Septimus Childe .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 19]: Could it be that this was the school in which both Sir Charles Dyke and Mensmore were fellow-students ?
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 37]: If so , Bruce failed to see why he should not forthwith place the whole of the facts in his possession at the service of the police , and allow the law to take its course .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 50]: On this supposition , the case against Mensmore was very black ; not , indeed , incapable of explanation -- for circumstantial evidence occasionally plays strange pranks with logic -- but of such a grave nature that no private individual would be justified in keeping his knowledge to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 25]: The deduction was intensely disagreeable ; but Bruce resolved to coerce his thoughts , and do that which was right , irrespective of consequences .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 8]: He did not possess a Clergy List .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 41]: No letter came from Mrs. Hillmer , so he walked across the Park to his club in Pall Mall to consult the appropriately bound black and white volume which gives reference to the many degrees of the Church of England .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 11]: Septimus Childe was a distinctive , though simple , name .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 6]: And it was not there .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 16]: There was not a Childe with a final `` e '' in the whole book .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 16]: Without that important letter , as his informant might be mistaken , there were several .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 37]: Close scrutiny of each man 's designation and duties convinced him that though any of these might be one of the particular Childe 's children , none answered to the description of the gentleman he sought .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 23]: Of course , he could always apply to Sir Charles Dyke , but he dreaded approaching the grief-stricken baronet on this matter .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 8]: Now there was no help for it .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 18]: The barrister was beginning to feel impatient at the constant difficulties which barred progress in each direction .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 23]: After all , it was a small thing merely to ask his friend if he ever knew a reverend gentleman named Childe .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 47]: Bruce was sure that Sir Charles would not be acquainted with Mr. Childe , and also with the fact that the Putney house had served as his school , for it would be strange beyond credence if it were so that he had not mentioned it .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 16]: The weather was still clear and cold , and a wintry sun made walking pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 13]: Claude , on quitting his club , set out again on foot .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 25]: He crossed St. James 's Square , Jermyn Street , and Piccadilly , and made his way to Oxford Street up New Bond Street .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 16]: Not often did he frequent these fashionable thoroughfares , and he had an excellent reason .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 22]: When walking , he was given to abstraction , and seldom saw his acquaintances if he encountered them in unusual quarters .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 38]: He would thus cut dead a woman at whose house he had dined the previous evening , or , when he was in practice at the Bar , fail to notice the salutation of his own leader .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 42]: To Claude himself this short-coming was intolerable ; consciousness of it when in the West made him the most alert man in the crowd to note anybody whom he knew , except on the rare occasions when he forgot his failing .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 8]: This morning Bond Street was pleasantly full .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 8]: People were beginning to return to town .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 18]: Parliament re-assembled in a few days , and he passed many who were on his visiting list .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 22]: Outside a well-known costumer 's he saw a brougham , into which a lady had just been assisted by the commissionaire .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 26]: It is no uncommon thing to recognize an acquaintance by the color of his horse , or the peculiar cut of the coachman 's whiskers .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 20]: This time Bruce knew the driver as well as the equipage , but the lady was not Mrs. Hillmer .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 33]: Instantly he was at the door , with his hat lifted ; he assumed an expression of polite regret as he saw Dobson , the maid , in her mistress 's place .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 21]: `` Sorry , '' he said , `` I knew the carriage , and thought that Mrs. Hillmer was inside .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 8]: She is well , I trust . ''
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 15]: `` Not very , sir , '' answered the maid with an angry pout .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 9]: `` Indeed , what is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 16]: `` Madame is going away , and has put us all on board wages . ''
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 20]: Dobson had some of the privileges of a companion , and resented this relegation to the servants ' hall .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 5]: `` Going away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 3]: cried Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 8]: `` A sudden departure , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 14]: The girl was arranging some parcels on the seat in front of her .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 29]: She was not disinclined for a conversation with this good-looking gentleman , so she smiled archly , as she said : `` Did n't you know , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 10]: I thought you would know all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 20]: What he might have ascertained by a longer chat the barrister could not tell , for an interruption occurred .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 12]: The coachman was more loyal to his mistress than the maid .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 32]: `` Beg pardon , sir , '' he cried , `` but the missus told us to hurry '' ; and he whipped his steed into the passing stream of carriages .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 8]: `` More complications , '' murmured Claude .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 7]: `` Mrs. Hillmer contemplates a bolt .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 10]: Shall I pay her another visit and surprise her ?
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 9]: No , confound it , I will not .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 12]: Let her go , and let things take their course . ''
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 20]: Not in the most amiable frame of mind at this discovery , he pursued his walk to Portman Square .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 7]: Sir Charles Dyke was at home .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 6]: He always was , now .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 35]: `` For goodness ' sake , Mr. Bruce , '' whispered Thompson in the hall , `` try to persuade Sir Charles to quit smokin ' , and readin ' , and thinkin ' .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 16]: He sits all day in the library and ` ardly has anything to eat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 17]: Claude reproached himself for having neglected his resolution to stir his friend into something like animation .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 36]: He was wondering what he should do in the matter , when the baronet rose at his entrance , saying , with a weary smile : `` Well , old fellow , what news ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 15]: The other suddenly decided to throw all questioning to the winds for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 9]: `` I have come to bring you out .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 8]: I wo n't hear of a refusal .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 16]: Let us walk to the club and have lunch and a game of billiards . ''
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 4]: Sir Charles protested .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 8]: He had slept badly and was tired .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 12]: `` All the more reason that you should sleep well to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 7]: Come , now , be advised .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 18]: You will allow yourself to become a hopeless invalid if you go on in this way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 10]: Dyke unwillingly consented , and they left the house .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 13]: The older man brightened up considerably amidst the bustle of the streets .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 38]: His color returned , he talked with some degree of cheerfulness , and even laughed as he said : `` I never understood you were a doctor , Claude , in addition to your other varied acquirements .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 15]: For the first time since -- since November last , I feel hungry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 16]: `` Why do n't you take my advice , and go away for some shooting ?
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 16]: It is not too late , even now , to go after a hare . ''
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 7]: `` I will think of it .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 11]: I wonder who we shall meet at the club . ''
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 8]: `` Lots of fellows , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 15]: And , by the way , you must be prepared for one little difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 8]: Suppose they ask about your wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 7]: The baronet 's momentary gaiety vanished .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 10]: He stopped short , and clutched Bruce 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 25]: `` Do n't you see , '' he almost moaned , `` that this is the reason I have remained indoors for so long ?
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 6]: What shall I say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 9]: `` You must make the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 19]: Say , off-handedly , you do n't know where she is -- either with relations or in Italy .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 13]: Anything will do , and it will create a false impression . ''
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 8]: `` I am sick of false impressions .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 7]: I can not do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 5]: `` You must . ''
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 29]: The stronger will prevailed , and they entered the doors of the Imperial , where , of course , Dyke was hailed at once by a dozen men .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 5]: `` Hallo , Charlie !
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 4]: Been seedy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 6]: `` Good gracious , Dyke !
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 5]: have you had influenza ?
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 16]: I 've missed you for months , now I come to think of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 12]: `` I have n't seen your wife for quite a time .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 5]: How is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 9]: In the multitude of questions there was safety .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 28]: Sir Charles answered vaguely , and a chance arrival created a diversion by announcing that the favorite had broken down in his preparation for the Grand National .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 18]: Later in the afternoon , the two found themselves ensconced in a quiet corner of the smoking-room .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 5]: Bruce seized the opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 20]: `` You told me , '' he said , `` that Mensmore and you were at school together ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 5]: `` Did I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 4]: said the baronet .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 9]: `` Yes ; do n't you remember ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 10]: `` I get mixed up in thinking about things .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 6]: But it is all right .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 4]: We were . ''
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 4]: `` Whereabouts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 25]: `` Oh , a private establishment kept by an old chap called Septimus Childe , -- Lucky Number was our nickname for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 10]: Bruce betrayed no surprise at this startlingly simple statement .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 14]: He said casually : `` I mean where was the school situated ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 7]: `` At Brighton in my time .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 20]: But afterwards he shifted to some place near London -- something to do with examinations , I fancy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 9]: `` But do n't you know where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 5]: `` How should I ?
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 6]: I was at Sandhurst then .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 8]: I believe the old boy is dead .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 6]: Why do you ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 12]: `` Oh , it has something to do with the inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 11]: I wo n't trouble you now with the details . ''
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 10]: `` Go on , I can stand it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 12]: `` But where is the good in paining you needlessly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 9]: `` That stage has passed , old chap .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 13]: My wife 's memory has almost become a dream to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 35]: `` Well , it is an extraordinary thing , but that place where -- that house at Putney , you know , must have been the new school of the Rev. Septimus Childe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 8]: `` How did you learn that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 14]: `` I have known it for months , ever since the inquest . ''
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 9]: `` And you did not tell me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 13]: `` True , but at the time it seemed of no consequence .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 36]: Now that Mensmore turns out to be a pupil of his , and probably passed the remainder of his early school days at that very establishment , the incident assumes a degree of importance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 37]: Sir Charles looked earnestly at his friend as he put his next question : `` Tell me , Claude , do you seriously believe that Mensmore had anything to do with my wife 's death ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 12]: `` I can not honestly give you a satisfactory answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 8]: `` But what do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 15]: `` If you press me I will try to put my opinion into words .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 29]: Mensmore was in some mysterious way associated with the crime ; but the degree of association , and whether conscious or unconscious , I do not know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 13]: `` What do you mean by ` conscious or unconscious ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 29]: `` I am sure that Lady Dyke met her death in his residence ; but it is impossible to say now if he was aware of her presence .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 14]: He was in London at the time , that is quite certain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 9]: `` Do the police know all this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 7]: `` I am glad of it .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 7]: Mensmore did not kill my wife .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 9]: The suggestion is absurd -- wildly absurd . ''
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 10]: `` Things look black against him , nevertheless . ''
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 8]: `` I tell you it is nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 9]: You are on the wrong track , Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 20]: What possible reason could he have had to decoy my wife to his flat and there murder her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 6]: `` None , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 12]: `` Then why do you hesitate to agree with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 11]: `` Because there is a woman in the case . ''
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 5]: `` Another woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 14]: `` Yes ; Mensmore 's sister , or half-sister , to be exact .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 8]: She also lives in Raleigh Mansions . ''
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 3]: `` Indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 13]: So all kinds of things have been going on without my knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 15]: Yet you promised faithfully to keep me informed of every incident that transpired . ''
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 19]: `` I am sorry , Dyke ; but you were so upset -- '' `` Upset , man .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 19]: Do n't you realize that this affair is all I have to think about in the world ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 24]: The baronet was so disturbed that Claude at once made up his mind to tell him as little as possible in the future .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 14]: These constant possibilities of rupture between them must be avoided at all hazard .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 19]: To change the conversation he said : `` Never mind ; this time you must pardon my inadvertence .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 15]: How do your wife 's people bear the continued mystery of her disappearance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 9]: `` At first they were awfully cut up .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 35]: But lately they have been reconciled to her death , which they say must have resulted from accident , and that her identity must have been mixed up with that of some other person .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 8]: Such things do happen , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 11]: Anyway , her sister has gone into mourning for her .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 19]: You did n't hear , I suppose , that I have made my little nephew my heir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 12]: `` Was that step necessary at your time of life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 10]: `` I shall never marry again , Bruce . ''
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 9]: `` Well , let us drop the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 47]: You have done right as regards the boy under present circumstances ; but , as a man of the world , I only point out that it is an unwise thing to bring up a youngster in expectation of something which chance might determine differently . ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 3]: `` Chance !
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 5]: There is no chance !
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 10]: My wife can not return from the grave ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 3]: `` True .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 8]: You have done right , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 13]: But the suddenness of the thing caused me to speak unwittingly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 19]: They were silent for a little while , when Sir Charles returned to the subject nearest his heart .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 10]: `` Has your search developed in other directions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 6]: Bruce fenced with the query .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 32]: `` To be candid , '' he said , `` I am now most busily engaged in the not very difficult task of throwing dust in the eyes of the police .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 33]: My motives are hardly definite to myself , but I do not want this unfortunate man , Mensmore , to be arrested until I have personally become convinced of his guilt . ''
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 5]: `` You are right .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 6]: Your instinct seldom fails you .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 16]: I question if he ever , to his own knowledge , saw my wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 9]: You see you have hit upon the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 22]: Show me her reason for making that secret journey , and I will tell you how she met her death . ''
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 8]: His concluding words sank to a murmur .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 15]: An old friend of Dyke 's had entered the room and came toward them .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 32]: A few minutes later Bruce quitted the Imperial and drove to his chambers , where he found a note from the ticket collector stating that Foxey 's name was William Marsh .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 36]: The day was still young , and the barrister paid a visit to the West London Police Court , where the records soon revealed the conviction of the cab-driver and the period of his sentence .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 22]: `` Let me see , '' said the resident inspector , `` his time at Holloway is up on February 6 .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 24]: That is a Monday , and as Sunday does n't count , he will be liberated on the 4th , about 8 A.M. .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 14]: That is the habit , sir , in the matter of short sentences .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 33]: If you want to see him when he leaves the jail you can either wait at the gates or at the nearest public-house , where the prisoners go for their first drink .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 7]: They seldom or never miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 8]: Bruce thanked the official and returned home .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 21]: He was on the point of going out to drive , when he received a letter from Sir Charles Dyke .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 29]: It ran : '' _ My Dear Claude _ , -- Today 's experiences have taught me to take the inevitable step of announcing my wife 's death .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 23]: Hence , I have forwarded the enclosed notice to an advertisement agency , with instructions to insert it in the principal papers .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 16]: I have also decided to follow your advice and leave town for a few days .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 18]: I am going to Wensley , my place in Yorkshire , should you happen to want me .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 8]: `` Yours , `` CHARLES DYKE . ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 7]: The notice read : `` DYKE .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 21]: -- On November 6 , Alice , wife of Sir Charles Dyke , Bart. , suddenly , at London . ''
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 12]: Next morning it figured in the obituary columns of many newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 23]: Bruce , though taken back by the suddenness of his friend 's resolve , saw no reason to endeavor to dissuade him .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 15]: In the words of the letter , it was `` the inevitable step . ''
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 25]: CHAPTER XVIII WHAT HAPPENED ON THE RIVIERA The _ White Heather _ swung quietly at her moorings in the harbor of Genoa the Superb .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 38]: The lively company on board , tired after a day 's sight-seeing , had left the marble streets and palace cafés to the Genoese , and sought the pleasant seclusion of the yacht 's airy promenade deck .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 20]: `` Dinner on board , followed by a dance , '' said Phyllis , as arbiter of the procedure .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 32]: A few hasty invitations sent out to British residents in Genoa met with general acceptance , and the lull between afternoon tea and the more formal meal was a grateful interlude .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 38]: Genoa is so shut in by its amphitheatre of hills that unless a gale blows from the west its bay is unruffled , and its atmosphere oppressively hot during the day , even in the winter months .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 29]: Sir William Browne 's excursion had proved so attractive to those invited that the _ White Heather _ was taken farther along the coast than was originally intended .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 30]: When all the best known resorts of the Riviera itself were exploited , some one , probably prompted thereto by Phyllis or Mensmore , suggested a run to Genoa .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 33]: They had been in the port three days , and on the morrow would hand the yacht over to the owner 's agents , those on board separating on their different routes .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 30]: The Brownes went to Florence and Rome , and Mensmore was pretending to hold out against a pressing request to accompany them , cordially given by his prospective father-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 15]: This afternoon Phyllis and he were leaning over the taffrail and discussing the point .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 10]: The young lady was slightly inclined to be angry .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 39]: Her eyes roamed over the magnificent panorama of church-crowned hills and verdant valleys , with the white city in front and the picturesque quays looking as though they had been specially decked for a painting by Clara Montalba .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 10]: But Phyllis paid heed to none of these things .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 18]: She wanted her lover to come with her , and not to fly away to smoke-covered London .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 4]: `` Business ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 13]: she cried , `` it is always business that men think of .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 35]: Of course I know that affairs must be attended to , but now that everything is settled and we are quite happy , it is too bad of you to run away immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 9]: `` But , dearest -- '' `` There !
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 7]: Take your hand off my arm .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 10]: You are not going to coax me into agreement .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 18]: Just because you receive a horrid letter this morning you go and upset all the arrangements . ''
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 7]: `` Phyllis , listen to me .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 11]: I -- '' `` You _ sha n't _ go .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 18]: I think it is mean of you to insist upon it when I am so urgent . ''
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 6]: `` I am not insisting .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 18]: You might at least help me to settle matters ; otherwise they will get terribly mixed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 9]: `` And you _ will _ stay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 12]: `` What else can I do when you ask me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 7]: `` Oh , you darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 31]: This little quarrel was very delightful , and made them feel ever so much more in love than before ; but it did not help Mensmore out of his difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 21]: `` Let us see what Corbett really says , '' he remarked , ruefully taking a letter from his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 9]: `` Am I to look , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 11]: I have no secrets from you , little woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 7]: Phyllis nestled up close to him .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 40]: This time she did not object to his hand resting on her shoulder , and together they read the following letter : '' _ My Dear Bertie _ , -- At last I am able to write you definitely .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 21]: The prospectors have struck it rich on our property , and I have sold two claims outright for $ 50,000 .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 28]: With this nest-egg I am taking the girls to New York , and shall then start by the _ Teutonic _ for your side of the pond .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 15]: I am due in Liverpool on February 4 , so look out for me .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 10]: `` Yours ever , `` SYDNEY H. CORBETT . ''
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 26]: Both gazed thoughtfully at the document for a few moments before Phyllis said : `` Does that mean we shall be rich , Bertie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 13]: Her companion emphasized the gratification of the plural pronoun by a squeeze .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 8]: `` I hope so , sweet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 11]: `` That will be very nice , wo n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 40]: I will marry you even if you have to take a place in father 's office ; but it will be so much better if we have n't to explain to him that we are poor after all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 3]: Mensmore laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 16]: `` It is not so bad as that in any case , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 26]: `` This Springbok Mine speculation will probably turn out well , but I look to Wyoming to yield the best and most permanent results . ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 10]: `` Why is Mr. Corbett coming to London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 42]: `` Because it is only in London that capital can be obtained for large undertakings , and if the Wyoming Goldfield is really a valuable one we may be able to realize some portion of our interests for a considerable sum .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 9]: Anyhow , he wants to consult me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 9]: `` Do you both own the ranch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 16]: `` Yes ; it was a joint transaction , but I found the money . ''
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 9]: `` And why did you come away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 13]: `` Well , we made very little out of it , Phil .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 18]: As Corbett has two sisters , I thought it best to leave what there was for him .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 42]: He was absurdly grateful about what he called my generosity in the matter , but now that the land has proved valuable , of course all that nonsense is at an end , and we go half-shares in the deal . ''
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 4]: `` Two sisters !
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 4]: They pretty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 3]: Jealous already !
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 22]: They are very nice , but much older than their brother , and he is my senior by two years . ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 10]: Miss Browne was graciously pleased to accept this explanation .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 21]: She knitted her smooth brow into a reflective frown as she said : `` Mr. Corbett arrives on the 4th .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 6]: It is now January 30th .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 10]: You really ought to go home , Bertie . ''
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 16]: `` Now my dear , sensible little woman is talking like her own self . ''
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 9]: `` I see I must give you permission .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 11]: But I did hope we would see Florence together . ''
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 5]: `` So we shall .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 9]: I 'll tell you what I can do .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 43]: I shall write to Corbett to-day , care of the steamer at Liverpool , tell him to go to my flat , and stay there a few days until I arrive , and go home myself at the end of next week .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 29]: He is sure to spend some time seeing the sights before tackling business , and he can do that as well without me as if I were there .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 21]: A line to my old housekeeper , who has a spare key , will make the place habitable for him .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 9]: Happy thought , I 'll do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 6]: `` And another happy thought !
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 10]: I 'll come and watch you do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 15]: She did not notice that Mensmore 's face clouded at this otherwise pleasant intimation .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 17]: Nevertheless , he raced off with her to the saloon and seated himself at the writing-table .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 33]: But before he placed pen to paper , Phyllis bending over him meanwhile , he suddenly exclaimed , in a tone of annoyance : `` Now , what a bore this is .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 31]: I do n't know how to address the letter to make sure of reaching him at once , and it is very important that it should not miss him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 5]: `` Father will know .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 6]: Let us ask him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 32]: `` No , '' said Mensmore judicially , `` I will row across the harbor to the Florio-Rubattino office , find out the exact thing , and send off the letter .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 4]: Back in half-an-hour .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 4]: Be good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 17]: And before Phyllis could argue the matter he was at the gangway shouting for a boat .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 36]: She blew a kiss to him as he shot over the narrow strip of water inside the mole , and little realized that Mensmore was saying to himself : `` That was a narrow squeak .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 17]: Never again , as long as I live , will I take another man 's name .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 15]: It causes no end of bother , and at the most unexpected moments . ''
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 29]: He did not trouble the Florio-Rubattino people , as he well knew that a letter addressed to the White Star offices would insure any communication reaching his friend .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 29]: The context of the missive , as finally indited at the post-office , explains his hesitancy to write it in the presence of his _ fiancée _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 15]: _ My dear Sydney _ , -- Your good news is more than surprising .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 14]: Although I believe you , I can not yet grasp its full significance .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 10]: However , let us leave explanations until we meet .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 35]: I am fixed here for a few days more , as I have just become engaged to the sweetest girl in the world , but will return home at the end of next week .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 30]: Meanwhile I want you to take up your residence at my flat , No. 12 Raleigh Mansions , Sloane Square , where my housekeeper has instructions to receive you .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 14]: Do not be surprised if you find the name of Corbett familiar there .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 13]: Indeed , I took the place in your name in August last .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 8]: However , all explanations when we meet .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 9]: `` Yours ever , `` BERTIE MENSMORE . ''
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 37]: This , with a note to the housekeeper , Mrs. Robinson , and another to the hall-porter of the Universities Club , lest by any chance the Liverpool letter missed his friend , completed his task .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 12]: He laughed as he hurried from the post-office to the harbor .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 5]: `` By Jove ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 41]: he said to himself , `` wo n't old Robinson be surprised when she gets my letter telling her that another Mr. Corbett is coming from America , and that my name , concealed for family reasons , is Mensmore .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 22]: I guess that Sydney will feel a bit mixed up , too , until I tell him the whole yarn . ''
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 10]: No wonder his housekeeper would fail to understand him .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 18]: Others , whose influence on his fortunes he little suspected , were already puzzled by the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 29]: Bruce , for instance , and White would be very glad if some occult power enabled them to read the seemingly trivial letters posted that day in Genoa .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 38]: Every person known to the reader , and not the least the visitor from the United States , was on the eve of a mad whirl of events , the outcome of which no man could prophesy .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 21]: As yet , one man only , Claude Bruce , had the slightest suspicion that affairs were approaching a crisis .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 21]: When Mensmore reached the _ White Heather _ he found Lady Browne and Phyllis dressed for a drive before dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 16]: Sir William seized the opportunity to cross-examine his daughter 's suitor as to his means .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 29]: Phyllis was an only child , and her father did not propose that she should live in penury , whatever the financial position of her husband might be .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 17]: He liked Mensmore , and had ascertained by private inquiries that his social position was good .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 47]: `` His father was a Major-General , '' said his informant , `` who lost his savings by speculation , and was unable to maintain his son in a crack cavalry corps , so the youngster resigned and went to America to try to better himself .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 33]: There was a daughter , too , by the first wife , a very charming woman , who , when the crash came , was supposed to have gone on the stage .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 10]: But I have never heard of her since . ''
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 21]: So far , the credentials were not bad ; but Sir William thought it his duty to ascertain definite particulars .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 7]: Mensmore was quite candid with him .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 33]: `` I have been somewhat of a rolling stone , '' he said , `` but I am glad to believe that people have never had cause to think ill of me .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 21]: At times , my affairs have been at a desperate stage , but I hope such periods have passed forever .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 17]: I have already spoken to you about the Springbok Mine -- '' The old gentleman nodded .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 25]: `` Well , this morning I have received very satisfactory news from America , '' and he handed over Corbett 's letter for perusal .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' agreed Sir William , `` these things promise well .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 10]: We will look into them when we reach England .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 13]: Meanwhile , I give my provisional sanction to my daughter 's engagement .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 8]: She is a good girl , Mensmore .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 9]: She will be a true and excellent wife .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 24]: I think you are worthy of her , and I hope that whatever clouds may have darkened your life will now pass away .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 8]: You two ought to be happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 11]: `` We will , sir , '' said Mensmore fervently .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 10]: `` By the way , where is your sister ?
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 8]: Is she in England or abroad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 7]: Mensmore had been expecting this question .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 6]: He was prepared for it .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 11]: `` Mrs. Hillmer is my half-sister , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 21]: `` I have not seen much of her since -- since an unhappy marriage she contracted some years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 3]: `` Indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 6]: Is her husband alive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 7]: `` I can hardly tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 4]: I believe so .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 8]: But she does not live with him .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 25]: She is well provided for , but it was partly on account of this matter that I came to the Riviera for the winter .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 13]: To tell the truth , I quarrelled with her about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 5]: `` Ah , well .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 15]: Her troubles need not affect Phyllis and you , except to give you warning .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 5]: And take my advice .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 7]: Never interfere between husband and wife .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 14]: However good your motive , ill is sure to come of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 19]: In the growing dusk Sir William Browne did not note his companion 's embarrassment in discussing this topic .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 26]: Mensmore was essentially an honorable man , and he detested the necessity which forced him to permit false inferences to be drawn from his words .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 8]: Yet there was no help for it .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 11]: He was compelled to suffer for the faults of another .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 16]: It was relief when the dressing-bell for dinner allowed him to escape to his cabin .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 9]: There was quite a large gathering for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 16]: Places like Genoa contain a number of highly interesting personages if the visitor discovers them .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 16]: The British race produces a richer variety of human flotsam and jetsam than any other .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 12]: These derelicts come to anchor in out-of-the-way parts of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 22]: They seem to have been everywhere and have done everything , while the whole world is an open book to them .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 28]: Thus there was no lack of variety in the conversation , and , as usual in such assemblies , it dealt more with persons than with incidents .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 28]: Phyllis had arranged the guests , so it may be taken for granted that her lover was near her -- in fact , he sat exactly opposite .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 29]: The lady he took in to dinner was the wife of an English doctor , and the British consul at the port was Miss Browne 's table companion .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 16]: The consul was a chatty man , who kept himself well informed concerning society events .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 20]: `` By the way , '' he said to Phyllis , `` did you ever meet Lady Dyke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 12]: `` No , her name is not familiar to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 12]: `` Do you mean the wife of Sir Charles Dyke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 17]: said Mensmore ; and the sudden interest he evinced caused Phyllis to glance at him wonderingly .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 8]: `` Yes , that is she . ''
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 7]: `` I know Sir Charles well .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 9]: What is there new about his wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 6]: `` She is dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 4]: `` Good Heavens !
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 2]: Dead !
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 6]: When , and how ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 30]: Mensmore was so obviously agitated that others present noticed it , and Phyllis marvelled much that in all their confidence the name of Dyke had never escaped his lips .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 17]: The consul , too , was a little nonplussed by the sensation caused by his words .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 19]: `` I fear , '' he said , `` that I have blurted out the fact rather unguardedly .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 8]: The Dykes are friends of yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 10]: `` No , no , not in that sense .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 9]: Sir Charles I have known for many years .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 10]: But are you sure his wife is dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 18]: `` My authority is an announcement in the _ Times _ to hand by to-day 's post .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 28]: I should not have mentioned it were not her ladyship so well known in society , and the affair is peculiar , to say the least . ''
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 6]: `` Peculiar -- how ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 41]: In his all-absorbing interest in the consul 's statement , Mensmore paid no heed to the curious looks directed at him ; he had become very pale , and was more excited in manner than the circumstances appeared to warrant .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 26]: `` In this sense : The paper is the issue of January 28 , yet the notice says that Lady Dyke died on November 6 .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 8]: This is odd , is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 30]: A woman of her position could hardly have quitted life so quietly that no one would trouble to publish the fact until nearly three months after the event . ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 8]: `` It is extraordinary -- inexplicable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 11]: `` Did you know Lady Dyke personally , Bertie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 5]: put in Phyllis timorously .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 11]: The question restored Mensmore to some sense of his surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 42]: `` I have never even seen her , '' he said , trying desperately to be commonplace ; `` but her husband is an old schoolfellow of mine , and I have heard much of both of them since their marriage .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 9]: I am quite shocked by the news . ''
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 21]: `` I can only repeat my regret for having spoken of it so carelessly , '' said the polite consul .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 15]: `` Oh , I am glad to know of it since it has happened .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 4]: Poor Lady Dyke !
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 8]: How strange that she should die ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 16]: Phyllis had the tact to change the conversation , and Mensmore gradually recovered his self-possession .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 47]: A woman 's eyes are keener than a man often gives her credit for ; and Phyllis saw quite plainly that after the first effect of the news had passed it , in some indefinable way , seemed to have a good effect on her lover .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 16]: But if a woman 's intuition is seldom at fault her reasoning faculties are narrow .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 21]: Trying to arrive at a solution of the mystery attending Mensmore 's behavior , Phyllis suddenly became hot all over .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 27]: She felt furiously and inordinately jealous of a woman she did not know , and who was admittedly dead before Mensmore and she herself had met .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 17]: Hence her nose went high in the air when Bertie claimed her for the first dance .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 15]: `` Who is this Lady Dyke in whom you are so deeply interested ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 10]: she said , drawing him beneath a sheltering awning .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 22]: `` As I said , '' replied Mensmore , `` she is the wife of an old acquaintance of mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 22]: `` But you must have been very fond of her to feel so keenly when you heard of her death ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 5]: `` Fond of her !
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 14]: I have never , to my knowledge , laid eyes on her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 7]: And the tone was somewhat mollified .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 12]: `` Then why did you look so worried during dinner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 9]: `` Simply because I know Sir Charles . ''
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 11]: `` What a dear , sympathetic little boy you are !
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 19]: When I die , Bertie , I suppose you will drop down stiff from grief at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 6]: `` Do n't talk nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 9]: We are missing all this delightful music . ''
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 22]: And they whirled away down the snowy deck , forgetful of all things save one , that they were in love .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 21]: Now , what a pity it was that Bruce was not on board the _ White Heather _ that night .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 15]: Many complications , and not a little misery , would have been avoided thereby .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 29]: CHAPTER XIX WHERE MRS. HILLMER WENT Sir Charles Dyke , in sending off the hurried announcement of his wife 's death , forgot the `` society '' papers .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 21]: Such a promising topic did not come in their way every week , and they made the most of it .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 6]: Where did Lady Dyke die ?
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 7]: Under what circumstances did she die ?
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 12]: They rolled the morsel under their tongue in every conceivable manner .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 5]: Details were not forthcoming .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 22]: `` Our representative called at Wensley House , Portman Square , but was informed that Sir Charles was in Yorkshire . ''
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 14]: Inquiry by a local reporter from Sir Charles in person elicited no information .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 49]: `` Lady Dyke is dead , '' wrote this enterprising journalist ; `` of that there can be no manner of doubt , but her husband states that for family reasons he is unable to supply the public with the precise facts concerning his wife 's demise . ''
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 9]: This ill-advised authentic statement only fanned the flame .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 54]: An evening journal got hold of the proceedings at the Putney Coroner 's Court which inquired into the death of a woman found in the Thames , and , with a portentous display of headlines , published an interview with the doctor giving particulars of the iron spike found imbedded in the skull .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 38]: The paper was also able to state `` on the best authority '' that at this inquest Sir Charles Dyke and the missing lady 's personal maid were called in to identify the body , but failed .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 26]: A first-class sensation was in full swing and threatened to reach the question stage in the House of Commons when Bruce took hold of affairs .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 57]: He went to Sir Charles Dyke 's solicitors , and induced them to send out the following authoritative communication to the press : `` Much unnecessary pain is being caused to Sir Charles Dyke and to the relatives of his late wife by the comments which have appeared in many newspapers regarding Lady Dyke 's death .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 30]: Her ladyship left her home on November 6th to pay a visit to her sister at Richmond , and since that date has not been seen or heard of .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 9]: There was no possible reason for her disappearance .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 61]: After a long and agonizing search , her husband and relatives have come to the conclusion that she met with some accident on the date named , with the result that her identity was not established , and she was probably buried from some hospital or other institution long before her friends seriously entertained the thought that she was dead .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 42]: Every such case of accidental death followed by the interment of unknown persons by the authorities , occurring on or about November 6th , has since been rigidly investigated , but no definite trace has been found of the missing lady .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 29]: Sir Charles Dyke determined to take the public step of announcing his wife 's death in the hope that any hitherto undiscovered clue might thereby come to light .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 21]: But there are no grounds to suppose that any other explanation of the occurrence than that given will be forthcoming .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 49]: The investigation has been in the hands of Scotland Yard throughout , so no good purpose can be served by further discussion in the press of what is now , and threatens to remain , a mystery rendered more complex by the simplicity of its leading features . ''
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 49]: Several newspapers , of course , pointed out that they were helping forward the inquiry by noising it abroad , but thenceforth the paragraphs ceased , being eclipsed in interest by the revelations of a great divorce case in which there were no less than six titled co-respondents .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 19]: One man was much puzzled by the original obituary notice and the semi-official statement supplied by the solicitors .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 11]: Mr. White did not know what to make of them .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 20]: He guessed that Bruce had inspired that `` explanation , '' and he read the concluding sentence many times .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 13]: `` It threatens to remain a mystery , does it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 3]: he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 15]: `` Just wait , Mr. Bruce , until I lay my hands on Corbett .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 23]: Clever as you are , I think I will show you that Scotland Yard can occasionally get the better of your theories .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 25]: Anyhow , Corbett will have to be very explicit about his movements before I am satisfied that he knows nothing about this business . ''
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 20]: He had written to the Chief of Police at Cheyenne , and something definite would soon come to hand .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 13]: Nevertheless , he felt somewhat shaken in his diagnosis of the crime .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 39]: Wyoming was a long way from London , and the letter from Corbett , which he had in his possession , did not exactly confirm his suspicion that this man was concerned in the murder of Lady Dyke .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 28]: He quickly became aware of Mrs. Hillmer 's departure , and at once jumped to the conclusion that she had recently left England for the United States .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 43]: A close scrutiny of the passenger lists at Liverpool and Southampton did not help him much , and he ultimately resolved to call on Bruce , in the hope that a chance exclamation might reveal the barrister 's opinion of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 14]: Claude was not at a loss to account for Mr. White 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 9]: `` I expected you , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 12]: `` Really now , may I ask why , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 25]: `` Because you have missed Mrs. Hillmer , and you want me to help you find where she has gone , and why . ''
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 4]: The detective smiled .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 16]: `` I wo n't say that you are wrong , sir , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 20]: `` In these affairs it is always well to keep an eye on the woman , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 10]: `` When did Mrs. Hillmer leave Raleigh Mansions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 6]: `` On the 30th . ''
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 7]: `` It is now February 3 .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 7]: Four days ago , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 6]: `` That is the time .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 39]: She might have left by the American line from Southampton or the Cunard from Liverpool on Wednesday , but she did not , and no one answering to her description is booked by the White Star to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 3]: `` Southampton !
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 2]: Liverpool !
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 10]: Do you think she has gone to America ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 4]: `` Where else ?
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 44]: She 's in league with Corbett , somehow , of that I am certain , and I think that the Monte Carlo address was a mere blind -- a clever one , too , as it even deceived you , Mr. Bruce . ''
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 6]: It did deceive me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 21]: `` Then why are you so surprised at the suggestion that the lady should attempt to cross the Atlantic ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 16]: `` Because I have not your rapid perception of the points of the case . ''
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 14]: `` That 's your way of pulling my leg , Mr. Bruce . ''
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 4]: The barrister smiled .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 12]: Mrs. Hillmer , of course , had gone to Monte Carlo .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 19]: Once there she would have little difficulty in tracing the _ White Heather _ , and overtaking Mensmore .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 18]: She would warn him of the police pursuit , and there would be a scene between them .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 5]: How would it result ?
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 10]: Would Mensmore , guilty , seek safety in flight ?
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 17]: Would he , innocent , return to London and demand to be confronted with his accusers ?
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 12]: For the life of him , Bruce could not say positively .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 25]: Yet he felt the situation was too delicate to be dealt with by Mr. White 's bludgeon methods , and he forebore to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 21]: The detective interpreted his silence as an admission of inability to find a satisfactory explanation of Mrs. Hillmer 's absence .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 13]: He went on : `` Corbett is not at Monte Carlo . ''
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 6]: `` So I imagined . ''
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 8]: `` Well , it is a fact .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 16]: The police have made constant inquiries for him at the Hotel du Cercle and elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 11]: Not the slightest trace of him can be found . ''
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 10]: `` I was there myself , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 6]: I have not forgotten that .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 15]: But it shows what a clever rascal the fellow is in concealing his identity .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 15]: However , he could never have counted on my discovering that letter of his .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 23]: Even if he is not in America we shall have some reliable data to go upon in answer to my queries . ''
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 8]: `` There I fully agree with you .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 17]: You will have done a great deal if you thoroughly clear up the mystery regarding Corbett .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 12]: May I ask you to let me know the result ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 6]: `` With pleasure , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 12]: And now , can I request a favor in return ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 4]: `` Certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 22]: `` Tell me , then , what is , in your opinion , the best way to find Mrs. Hillmer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 13]: Bruce did not expect to be thus openly challenged on the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 37]: It was one thing to withhold his own theories and discoveries from this representative of the majesty of the law , but quite another to refuse to help a detective with whom he was nominally working .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 10]: Besides , Mrs. Hillmer had four days ' start .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 25]: It would take some time -- possibly a telegram would not be sufficiently explicit -- to obtain the desired assistance from the Continental police .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 12]: Yes -- in this instance , Mensmore must take his chances .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 44]: `` If I were you , '' said Bruce , slowly weighing his words , `` I would inquire at the Continental booking-offices at Victoria and Charing Cross , and from the guards in charge of the morning mail trains on the 30th .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 33]: In fact , it would be quite safe if you were to wire the authorities at Monte Carlo , asking if Mrs. Hillmer is not now at the Hotel du Cercle . ''
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 10]: The detective started as though he had been shot .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 14]: he cried , `` you think she is there all the time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 12]: `` I think she has been there since Wednesday morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 7]: `` That is what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 9]: Why did you not tell me sooner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 7]: `` Because you never asked me .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 11]: And now , Mr. White , one word of advice .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 4]: Go slow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 20]: `` It 's all jolly fine telling me to go slow when I have no reason to go fast .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 12]: The case even against Corbett is shadowy enough at present . ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 3]: `` Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 9]: Wait until you can grasp a substance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 32]: `` I will , sir , '' said White , jamming his hat on ; `` but when I lay my hands on Corbett I will grasp him hard enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 31]: It took the policeman all that day to satisfy himself that Mrs. Hillmer had really booked for the Riviera by the Club train from Charing Cross on the preceding Monday .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 28]: Just as he verified the fact , came a reply from the Monte Carlo police : `` Mrs. Hillmer arrived at the Hotel du Cercle on Wednesday .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 6]: Left for Italy same afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 8]: Shall we endeavor to trace her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 9]: `` Oh , bother , '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 10]: `` Corbett may be in Jerusalem by this time .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 18]: And here have I been fussing about Wyoming or some other potato-patch in the Far West . ''
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 12]: However , he wired again to Monte Carlo : `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 7]: Locate Mrs. Hillmer , if possible .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 10]: I will then telegraph instructions to local police . ''
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 12]: When this message was despatched he felt easier in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 8]: The chase was at least getting warm .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 37]: `` I can not arrest him yet , '' he reflected ; `` but if I once get fairly on his track , I will not lose sight of him again if I can help it .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 12]: I suppose it will mean a trip to Italy for me .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 17]: I must lay the evidence before the Treasury to see if a warrant is justified . ''
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 6]: Two days passed without incident .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 32]: Late on Sunday evening , February 5 , a Continental telegram was handed to him at Scotland Yard : `` Mrs. Hillmer 's present address , Hotel Imperiale , Florence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 24]: He promptly wired the Chief of Police at Florence : `` Keep Mrs. Hillmer , English visitor , Hotel Imperiale , under surveillance .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 13]: Also watch her associates , particularly Englishman named Corbett , if there .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 4]: Letter follows . ''
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 19]: `` That 's a good stroke of business , '' said he , when the message was sent .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 9]: `` Now we sha n't be long ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 38]: It was in contented mood that he lit a cigar in his office , before walking home for dinner , but a messenger with the badge of the Commercial Cable Company in Northumberland Avenue bustled past him .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 10]: `` Who 's the cable for , boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 4]: said the detective .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 11]: `` White , Scotland Yard , '' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 6]: `` That 's me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 27]: He tore open the envelope , and found that the contents were coded , but he caught the word `` Corbett '' amidst the unintelligible jumble .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 40]: With some excitement he rushed into the office to find the A B C Code , and after some confusion in deciphering the words , this was what he read : `` Regret delay in replying to your communication .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 17]: Corbett left New York in _ White Star _ steamer due Liverpool , February 4 . ''
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 4]: `` February 4 ?
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 6]: Why , that 's yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 10]: Good gracious , he 's here all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 12]: Well , of all the -- '' But exclamations were useless .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 18]: Calling another plain-clothes man to accompany him , he drove off in mad haste to Sloane Square .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 16]: About an hour later Bruce received a typewritten slip gummed on to a telegraph form .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 18]: It was from Florence , and ran as follows : `` My brother wildly excited regarding allegations .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 6]: We start for London to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 5]: Meanwhile fearful complications expected .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 22]: Mr. Corbett , of Wyoming , my brother 's friend , is probably occupying his flat , and may be arrested .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 8]: We both trust you to save him .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 9]: Wire us at Modane or Gare du Nord .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 5]: `` GWENDOLINE HILLMER . ''
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 12]: So Bruce also raced off in a hansom towards Sloane Square .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 20]: CHAPTER XX MR. SYDNEY H. CORBETT The detective glanced up at Bruce 's chambers while passing through Victoria Street .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 37]: `` I wonder what he would think if he knew what we are after , '' he said to his colleague , one of the two who accompanied him when the barrister was arrested by mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 9]: `` What _ are _ we after ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 4]: said the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 18]: `` This time we are going to nail the right Corbett , '' was the confident answer .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 8]: `` Will we cart him off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 8]: `` Well , now , that depends .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 22]: I think I am quite right in collaring him unless he explains to my satisfaction , which is hardly likely . ''
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 13]: `` The charge is one of murder , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 7]: `` Who did he kill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 19]: `` Well , up to now it has n't come out , for the sake of the family .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 12]: But if Corbett is here you will know soon enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 12]: `` It 's a funny way to go to work . ''
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 8]: `` Commissioner 's orders , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 17]: I am not to reveal the la -- the name until it can not be helped .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 27]: However , as I have said so much , I do n't mind telling you it 's a woman , and a big one too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 3]: `` Big !
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 7]: Fat , do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 7]: A woman of high position . ''
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 3]: `` Phew !
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 9]: A regular society scandal , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 10]: `` That 's about the size of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 14]: On arrival at Sloane Square they quickly ascended to No. 12 Raleigh Mansions .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 28]: A stout , elderly woman answered their knock , and a glance at her face revealed the map of Ireland , although her name was Saxon Robinson .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 6]: `` Mr. Corbett in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 3]: inquired White .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 8]: `` Faix , he 's not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 7]: `` Then where is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 27]: `` I do n't know , misther , an ' if I did I would n't be afther telling when axed in an oncivil manner . ''
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 22]: `` All right , Mrs. -- '' `` Robinson 's my name , if that 's anny use to ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 7]: `` Very well , Mrs. Robinson .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 35]: We wish to have a word with Mr. Corbett , and we will be much obliged if you can tell us when he is likely to return , if he is in London . ''
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 12]: `` Arrah , it 's meself is mixed intirely about him .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 36]: Sure _ this _ Mr. Corbett is in London right enough , and is comin ' in to dinner in half-an-hour , so by yer lave I 'll jist go on wid me wurruk . ''
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 11]: `` May we come in and wait for him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 13]: Mrs. Robinson surveyed them suspiciously , but seemingly decided in their favor .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 19]: `` Stip in here , gintlemen both , '' she said , and conducted them to the sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 16]: A fire now burned brightly in the grate wherein Bruce had made his pregnant discovery .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 18]: The damaged bracket still stared at White , so to speak , but he saw it not .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 17]: Mrs. Robinson bustled away to the kitchen , and the two officers sat silently waiting developments .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 14]: Suddenly a thought occurred to White , and he went into the passage .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 23]: `` Mrs. Robinson , '' he said , `` what did you mean by referring to _ this _ Mr. Corbett ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 17]: A quick step came bounding up the stairs , and a key rattled in the lock .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 54]: `` You 'd betther ax him yerself , '' responded the housekeeper pithily , and the door opened to admit a handsome , well-knit man , tall and straight , with the clearly cut features of the true Westerner , and the easy carriage of one accustomed to the freedom of the prairie .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 5]: He was quietly dressed .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 34]: The only sign that he was not a Londoner was given by his wide-awake felt hat , the last token of environment relinquished by a wandering citizen from the region of the Rockies .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 21]: In the semi-darkness of the interior he could but dimly discern the form of the detective behind the ready-tongued housekeeper .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 16]: `` There 's two gintlemen to see ye , Misther Corbett , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 14]: `` Well , now , that 's curious , '' he answered cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 22]: `` I can only see one of you , but I 'm glad to have you call , stranger , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 4]: Come right in .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 12]: Are you sent by my friend to kinder cheer me up ?
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 15]: I find this big city of yours a powerful kind of tonic after Wyoming .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 5]: Come right in . ''
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 18]: Mr. White was as greatly nonplussed by the newcomer 's attitude as by his flow of language .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 11]: Within the drawing-room Corbett caught sight of the second detective .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 3]: `` Hello !
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 6]: Here 's the other one .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 7]: Ve-ry glad to meet you both .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 27]: Now , if you 'll just tell me your names we 'll get along straight away , as I guess you know mine all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 10]: The man was genuinely pleased by this unexpected visit .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 20]: He smilingly pushed towards them a box of cigars , green ones , and helped himself to a weed .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 27]: `` My name , '' said the detective , `` is Inspector White , of Scotland Yard , and my friend here accompanies me officially . ''
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 10]: `` And has n't he got a name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 10]: `` Yes ; but it does n't matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 14]: `` Well , if it does n't matter , we wo n't quarrel .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 23]: I guess you 've got a message of some sort for me , else you would n't trouble to climb these stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 12]: Why do n't you have el-e-vators in these big buildings ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 18]: `` As I said , '' began Mr. White , `` we are from Scotland Yard . ''
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 5]: `` That 's so .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 16]: I 've got that fixed O.K. Your name is I. White , from Scotland Yard .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 21]: I do n't know where Scotland Yard is , but we 'll worry along without the geography of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 7]: `` I am in the police .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 5]: My title is Inspector .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 7]: It is not my Christian name .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 11]: Scotland Yard is the headquarters of the London police . ''
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 22]: The American 's eyes opened wide in wonder at this announcement , and a perplexing thought seemed to occur to him .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 25]: But he said quietly : `` I 'll figure it out better when you tell me why you 've been good enough to call .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 7]: And suppose we all sit down .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 8]: I 'm not used to stone pavements .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 5]: I 'm tired . ''
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 9]: `` Your name is Sydney H. Corbett ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 11]: said the detective severely , though he took a chair .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 9]: `` So my people always told me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 12]: `` And you have occupied these chambers since August last ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 5]: `` Have I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 7]: `` So I am informed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 8]: `` Get along with your story . ''
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 10]: `` You have just returned to England from Wyoming .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 14]: The New York police cabled me that you arrived in Liverpool yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 5]: `` Did they now ?
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 8]: That was real cute of 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 23]: `` I want to ask you , in the first instance , the exact date of your departure from this country . ''
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 25]: Before replying to the detective Corbett looked at him fixedly , as though he was trying to read what was passing in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 22]: At last he said with a smile : `` Say , what are you after , Mr. White of Scotland Yard ?
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 5]: What 's the game ?
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 7]: Who 's been fooling you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 13]: `` That is not the way to talk to me , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 16]: Answer my question fully and properly , or it may be worse for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 3]: `` Jehosh !
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 11]: Have you come to wipe the floor with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 12]: `` Are you going to reply to me or not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 23]: `` I 'm not going to speak square to any man who comes along and puts a thing like you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 9]: I can get my information by other means .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 62]: You leave me no alternative -- '' Mr. White had half risen and was about to add , `` but to arrest you , '' when , with a rapidity known only to those accustomed to `` draw '' from boyhood , Corbett whipped a revolver from a hip pocket and covered the bridge of White 's nose with the muzzle .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 30]: `` Just you sit still , right there , Mr. White of Scotland Yard , or I will let daylight through you and your nameless friend if he interferes .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 6]: You 'd better believe me .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 3]: By gad !
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 7]: I wo n't speak twice . ''
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 8]: Neither White nor his companion were cowards .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 6]: But they were quite helpless .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 21]: They had not grappled with the circumstances with sufficient alertness , and they were utterly at this man 's mercy .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 34]: They were away from the door , and a table separated them from Corbett , while there was that in his eye which told them he would shoot if either of them moved .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 13]: They both sprang to their feet , and glared at him impotently .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 35]: `` Now , gentlemen , '' said Corbett , with the utmost coolness , `` let me persuade you to sit down again and go on with your story , which interests me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 8]: White was scarlet with wrath and annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 10]: `` Let me tell you -- '' he roared .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 5]: `` Sit down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 23]: `` Make the best of it , Jim , '' murmured the other policeman ; and the queer gathering resumed their seats .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 10]: `` That 's better , '' said Corbett genially .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 11]: `` Now , we 'll have a nice little chat .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 25]: Am I correct in supposing that you were about to march me off to jail just now , when I spoilt the proposition ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 12]: `` There 's no use in resisting , '' growled White .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 6]: `` You can not escape .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 24]: If you have an atom of sense left you will come with us quietly , as it 's all up with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 15]: `` It looks like it , '' said Corbett , with a grim smile .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 23]: `` But if it 's so bad a case as all that , there 's no desperate hurry , is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 12]: `` You 're only making matters more difficult for yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 3]: `` Maybe .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 37]: But as I happen to be a citizen of the United States , I allow that I ca n't be whipped off to prison just because a fool like you thinks it 's good for me .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 24]: I 've been a law-abiding man all my life , and I 've lived in places where each man made his own law .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 16]: If you can show good cause for your action , I 'll stand the racket .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 11]: At present I regard you as a blamed idiot . ''
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 6]: The situation overcame the detective .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 15]: He could only mutter : `` Time will show who 's the idiot . ''
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 29]: `` I 'm getting hungry , Mr. White of Scotland Yard , and I 've a kind of notion that the old lady is ready with the eatables .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 13]: Will you be good enough to say what you 're after ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 25]: `` I came here to ask you to account for your movements , and , failing a satisfactory explanation , to arrest you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 6]: `` On what charge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 19]: `` For being concerned in the murder of Lady Dyke , on or about November 6 last . ''
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 5]: `` Lady Dyke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 7]: `` Arrest _ me _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 7]: `` I placed you right away .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 13]: You are a blamed idiot , Mr. White of Scotland Yard . ''
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 14]: This repetition of his name and address goaded the detective almost beyond endurance .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 27]: `` Now you know the charge , '' he shouted , `` are you coming with us quietly , or -- '' `` Or what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 8]: The revolver still hovered across the table .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 11]: `` Are we going to sit here all night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 18]: It was a weak conclusion , but to suggest an attack was sheer madness under the conditions .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 11]: `` I guess not , '' was the calm answer .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 14]: `` I want my dinner , and I mean to have it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 10]: Eat your dinner and have done with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 5]: `` That 's better .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 8]: You and your friend shall join me .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 19]: We 'll have a nice little talk and straighten out matters , which have got kinder mixed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 9]: This was too much for White 's associate .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 5]: He burst out laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 31]: `` I allowed there was a joke in the deal , somewhere , '' went on Corbett , `` but I have n't quite got the hang of it yet .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 31]: Now , Mr. White of Scotland Yard , are you going to act like a reasonable man , or must I keep your nose in line with the barrel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 43]: White was saved from deciding which horn of the dilemma he would land on , for a sharp rat-tat at the door induced silence , and a moment later Bruce 's voice was heard inquiring : `` Is Mr. Corbett in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 20]: `` Faix , there may be a half-a-dozen of him in by this time , '' cried Mrs. Robinson .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 13]: `` I dunno where I am , at all , at all .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 10]: The gintlemen are in the parlor , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 4]: And Bruce entered .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 14]: In order to enfilade the new-comer scientifically , Corbett backed to the corner .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 27]: Claude glanced at the three , saw the revolver , and said with a comical air of relief : `` Thank goodness , nothing has happened .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 15]: Put away your pistol , Mr. Corbett ; you will not need it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 23]: Although the barrister 's manner differed considerably from the brusque methods adopted by Mr. White , the American remained on his guard .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 41]: He said stiffly : `` You all seem to know me fairly well ; but if you had the advantage of closer acquaintance , you would allow that I am not the man to be rushed on a confidence trick .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 19]: If somebody does n't explain quick I will lose my temper , and there will be trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 7]: `` I sympathize with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 3]: cried Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 20]: `` But the first thing you must learn in this country is to keep dry cigars for your visitors .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 9]: Our respective tastes differ in that respect . ''
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 20]: `` I guess I 'll cotton to you , stranger ; but I 'm tired holding this pistol . ''
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 7]: `` Put it away , then .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 8]: I tell you it is not wanted .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 6]: White , listen to me .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 9]: You have hit upon the wrong man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 5]: `` Wrong man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 13]: cried the detective , feeling more confident in the barrister 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 15]: `` Why , I 've had a cable about him from New York . ''
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 10]: `` Possibly ; but you 're mistaken , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 21]: Mr. Corbett has not been within five thousand miles of England for years , possibly not in his life . ''
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 8]: `` Bully for you , stranger ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 4]: broke in Corbett .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 26]: `` Then who is Mr. Sydney H. Corbett whom you believe , as well as I , to be the murderer of Lady Dyke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 5]: `` Steady , White .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 14]: The last time I saw you I appealed to you to go slow .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 44]: The man whom you want , simply because he happens to be the real occupant of these rooms , is at present travelling to London as fast he can from Florence , and his sister , Mrs. Hillmer , is with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 3]: `` Florence !
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 4]: Mrs. Hillmer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 4]: gasped the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 12]: `` I 've just arranged to have her watched there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 15]: `` Your arrangements , though admirable , are somewhat late in the day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 10]: `` Then what is her brother 's name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 4]: `` Albert Mensmore .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 40]: For some reason , hidden at this moment , he lived here under the name of the gentleman who has , I see , been giving you a practical lesson in the art of not jumping at conclusions . ''
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 8]: `` Have you known this long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 6]: `` For some weeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 10]: `` Then why did n't you tell me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 16]: `` Because I have no definite reason for connecting Mensmore with Lady Dyke 's death .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 23]: If I had , his action in returning to London the moment he hears of the charge would shake my belief . ''
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 6]: `` Who told him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 5]: `` Mrs. Hillmer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 10]: `` Oh , this business is quite beyond me .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 10]: I ca n't fathom it a little bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 9]: And White sank dejectedly to his chair again .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 43]: `` I do n't know what you 're talking about , gentlemen , '' said Corbett , pocketing his revolver ; `` but it dawns upon me that I sha n't be required to shoot anybody or sleep in jail to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 17]: `` Why did n't you answer my questions properly , and save all this nonsense ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 9]: `` I 'll tell you why , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 11]: The name of a friend of mine has been mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 11]: Albert Mensmore has been more than a brother to me .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 20]: I allowed you meant mischief to him , as you thought you were talking to him all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 30]: I do n't know much about you , but I hope that your first action would not be to give away your chum if he is in trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 21]: The detective did not answer , though his look of astonishment at Corbett 's declaration of motive was eloquent enough .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 20]: `` Before we quit this business , '' went on the American , `` let me say one thing .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 17]: Any man who tells you that Albert Mensmore murdered a woman is telling you a lie .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 24]: I do n't know anything about this Lady Dyke , or how she may have died , but I do know my friend .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 25]: He 's good in a tight place , but , to think of him killing a woman -- Jehosh , it 's sickening . ''
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 9]: Mrs. Robinson burst in , with face aflame .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 12]: `` Is this palaverin ' to go on all night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 4]: she demanded angrily .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 33]: `` Here 's the dinner sphilin ' , after all me worry and bother , with the head of me vexed to know who is the masther and who ish n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 10]: `` All right , mother , '' laughed Corbett .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 8]: `` Bring in the whole caboodle . ''
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 31]: `` Mr. Corbett , '' said Bruce , `` I hope you will come and have lunch with me to-morrow , at this address , '' handing him a card .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 11]: `` I want to have a long talk with you .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 25]: Mr. White , if you come with me I will explain a good deal to you of which you are now in ignorance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 17]: `` Surely , Mr. Corbett will answer a few questions first , '' said the detective .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 14]: `` Do n't you think you have troubled him sufficiently for this evening ?
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 8]: Besides , he can tell us nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 19]: All the explanation is really due to him , and I propose to give it to him to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 37]: Come , White , this time I promise you that a considerable portion of your inquiry shall be cleared up , and I do not speak without foundation , as you have often learned hitherto . ''
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 30]: So the mysterious Sydney H. Corbett was left in undisturbed possession of his flat and his dinner , while the trio passed out into the quietude of the streets .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 23]: CHAPTER XXI HOW LADY DYKE LEFT RALEIGH MANSIONS Mr. White was actually inclined to preserve silence while they walked to Victoria Street .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 31]: The events of the preceding hour had not exactly conduced to the maintenance , in the eyes of his brother officer , of that pre-eminent sagacity which he invariably claimed .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 40]: His companion rubbed in this phase of the matter by saying : `` I should think , Jim , you will give Raleigh Mansions wide berth for some time to come , after making two bad breaks there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 20]: But it was no part of Bruce 's scheme that the detective should be rendered desperate by repeated failures .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 20]: `` It is not Mr. White 's fault , '' he said , `` that these errors have occurred .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 20]: They are rather the result of his pertinacity in leaving no clue unsolved which promises to lead to success .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 37]: When this case ends , if ever it does end , I feel sure he will admit that he has never before encountered so much difficulty in unravelling the most complex problems within his experience . ''
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 12]: `` That is so , '' chimed in the senior detective .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 20]: `` The thing that beats me in this affair is the want of a beginning , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 26]: One would imagine it the work of a lunatic if Lady Dyke herself had not contributed so curiously to the mystery of her disappearance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 13]: `` There you are , White ; that is the true scent .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 20]: Find the motive and we find the murderer , if Lady Dyke was wilfully put to death . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 9]: _ If _ she was , Mr. Bruce ?
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 8]: Have you any doubt about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 14]: `` There can not be certainty when we are groping in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 16]: But the gloom is passing ; we are on the eve of a discovery . ''
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 10]: At Bruce 's residence White 's colleague left him .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 14]: Soon the barrister and the policeman were sitting snugly before a good fire .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 21]: There Claude took him step by step through each branch of his inquiry as it is known to the reader .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 4]: He omitted nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 38]: The discovery of Jane Harding and of Mensmore , the latter 's transactions with Dodge & Co. , his dramatic _ coup _ at Monte Carlo and its attendant love episode -- all these were exhaustively described .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 43]: He enlarged upon Mrs. Hillmer 's anxiety when the tragedy became known to her , and did not forget Sir Charles Dyke 's amazement at the suggestion that his old playmate might prove to be responsible for the death of his wife .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 28]: He produced the waxen moulds of the piece of iron found on the body at Putney , and the ornamental scroll from which it had been taken .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 12]: At this bit of evidence Mr. White 's complacency forsook him .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 25]: Thus far he had experienced a feeling of resentment against Bruce for having concealed from him so much that was material to their investigation .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 35]: But when he realized that a powerful link in the chain of events had all along been placidly resting before his eyes his distress was evident , and the barrister came to his rescue .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 28]: `` You are not to blame , White , '' he said , `` for having failed to note many things which I have now told you .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 8]: You are the slave of a system .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 38]: Your method works admirably for the detection of commonplace crime , but as soon as the higher region of romance is reached it is as much out of place as a steam-roller in a lady 's boudoir .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 31]: Look at the remarkable series of crimes the English police have failed to solve of late , merely because some _ bizarre _ element had intruded itself at the outset .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 14]: Have you ever read any of the works of Edgar Allan Poe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 7]: The detective answered in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 21]: `` The Murders of the Rue Morgue '' and `` The Mystery of Marie Roget '' were familiar to him .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 19]: `` Well , '' went on Bruce , `` there you have the accurate samples of my meaning .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 17]: Poe would not have been puzzled for an hour by the vagaries of Jack the Ripper .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 47]: He would have said at once -- most certainly after the third or fourth in the series of murders -- ` This is the work of an athletic lunatic , with a morbid love of anatomy and a morbid hatred of a certain class of women .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 23]: Seek for him among young men who have pestered doctors with outrageous theories , and who possess weak-minded or imbecile relatives . '
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 12]: Then , again , take the murder on the South-Western Railway .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 16]: Do you think Poe would have gone questioning bar-tenders or inquiring into abortive love affairs ?
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 3]: Not he !
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 32]: Jealous swains do not carry pestles about with them to slay their sweethearts , nor do they choose a four-minutes ' interval between suburban stations for frenzied avowals of their passion .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 28]: Here you have the clear trail of a clever lunatic , dropping from the skies , as it were , and disappearing in the same erratic manner .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 27]: That is why I tell you most emphatically that neither you nor I have yet the remotest conception as to who really killed Lady Dyke . ''
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 11]: `` Surely things look black now against this Mensmore ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 4]: `` Do they ?
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 34]: How would it have fared with an acquaintance of one of the unfortunate women killed by Jack the Ripper had the police found him in the locality with fresh blood-stains on his clothes ?
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 24]: What would have resulted from the discovery of a chemist 's mortar among the possessions of one of Elizabeth Camp 's male friends ?
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 11]: Come now , be honest , and tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 9]: But Mr. White could only smoke in silence .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 27]: `` Therefore , '' continued Bruce , `` let us ask ourselves why , and how , it was possible for Mensmore to commit the crime .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 27]: Personally , notwithstanding all that we apparently know against him circumstantially , I should hardly believe Mensmore if he confessed himself to be the murderer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 15]: `` Now , why on earth do you say that , Mr. Bruce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 10]: `` Because Mensmore is normal and this crime abnormal .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 28]: Because the man who would blow out his brains on account of losses at pigeon-shooting never had brains enough to dispose of the body in such fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 28]: Because Mensmore , having temporarily changed his name for some trivial reason , would never resume it with equal triviality with this shadow upon his life . ''
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 18]: `` Then why have you told me all these things that tell so heavily against him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 30]: `` In order that , this time at least , you may feel that the production of a pair of handcuffs does not satisfactorily settle the entire business . ''
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 23]: `` I promise there shall be no more arrests until this affair is much more decided than it is at present . ''
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 3]: `` Good .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 15]: I shall make a detective of you after my own heart in time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 24]: `` Yet I can not help being surprised at the very strange fact that his own sister should seem to suspect him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 8]: Now you have struck the true line .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 7]: Why did she have that fear ?
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 7]: There I am with you entirely .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 12]: Let us ascertain that and I promise you an important development .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 57]: Mrs. Hillmer and Mensmore are both concerned in the disappearance of Lady Dyke , yet neither knew that she had disappeared , and both are deeply upset by it , for Mrs. Hillmer flies off to warn her brother , and the brother posts back to London the moment it comes to his ears through her .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 15]: There , you see , we have a key which may unlock many doors .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 20]: For Heaven 's sake let it not be battered out of shape the instant it reaches our hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 7]: But Mr. White was quite humble .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 21]: `` As I have told you , '' he said , `` I have done with the battering process . ''
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 7]: `` I am sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 15]: And now listen to the most remarkable fact that has yet come to light .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 15]: Lady Dyke 's body was taken from Raleigh Mansions to Putney in a four-wheeler .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 17]: The cabman was forthwith locked up by the police and clapped into prison for three months .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 18]: He was released yesterday , and will be here within the next quarter of an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 12]: The detective 's hair nearly rose on end at this statement .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 8]: `` Look here , Mr. Bruce ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 20]: he cried , `` have you any more startlers up your sleeve , or is that the finish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 11]: `` That is the last shot in my locker . ''
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 6]: `` I 'm jolly glad !
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 18]: I half expected the next thing you would say was that you did the job yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 18]: `` It would n't be the first time you thought that ; eh , my friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 4]: White positively blushed .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 8]: that 's chaff , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 23]: `` But why the dickens did the police lock up this cabman -- the only witness we could lay our hands upon ?
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 14]: Why , I myself questioned every cabman in the vicinity several times . ''
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 25]: `` Because he got drunk on the proceeds of the journey , and subsequently thought he was Phaeton driving the chariot of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 10]: But , there , he will tell you himself .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 31]: I met him yesterday morning outside Holloway Jail , and persuaded him to come here to-night , provided he has not gone on the spree again with disastrous results . ''
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 52]: The entrance of Smith -- obviously relieved to see his master and the `` tec '' on such good terms -- to announce the arrival of `` Mr. William Marsh , '' settled any doubts as to the cabman 's intentions , and his appearance established the fact of his sobriety .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 13]: Three months `` hard '' had made the cab-driver a new man .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 9]: Recognition was mutual between him and Mr. White .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 10]: `` Hello , Foxey , '' cried the latter .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 9]: `` It 's you , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 40]: `` Me it is , guv ` nor ; but I did n't know there was to be a ` cop ' here '' -- this with a suspicious glance at Bruce and a backward movement towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 22]: `` Do not be alarmed , '' said the barrister ; `` this gentleman 's presence implies no trouble for you .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 35]: We want you to help us , and if you do so willingly I will make up that lost fiver you received for driving two people to Putney the night you were arrested . ''
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 13]: The poor old cabman became very confused on hearing this staggering remark .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 39]: Up to that moment he regarded Bruce as the agent for a charitable association , and there was no harm , he told his `` missus , '' in trying to `` knock him for a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 13]: He stood nervously fumbling with his hat , but did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 8]: White knew how to deal with him .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 11]: `` Sit down , Foxey , and have a drink .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 8]: You need one to cheer you up .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 6]: Answer this gentleman 's questions .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 7]: He means you no harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 5]: `` Honor bright ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 5]: `` Honor bright . ''
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 11]: `` Well , I do n't mind if I do .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 8]: No soda , thank you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 7]: Just a small drop of water .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 13]: Ah , that 's better stuff 'n they keep in Holloway . ''
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 14]: Thus fortified , Marsh had no hesitation in telling them what he knew .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 17]: Substantially , his story was identical with the version given to Bruce by the ticket collector .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 8]: `` Can you describe the gentleman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 4]: said the barrister .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 8]: He was just like any other swell .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 15]: Tall and well-dressed , and talked in the ` aw - ` aw style .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 13]: It might ha ' been yerself for all I could tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 9]: `` Do you think it was I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 5]: Foxey scratched his head .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 20]: `` No , p ` r ` aps it was n't , now I come to rec ` llect .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 12]: He ` ad a moustache , and you ` ave n't .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 39]: Beggin ' yer pardon , sir , but you ` ave a bit of the cut of a parson or a hactor , an ' this chap was n't neither -- just an every-day sort of toff . ''
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 12]: `` Could you swear to him if you saw him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 8]: `` That I could n't , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 17]: I am a rare ` and at langwidge , but I could n't manage that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 18]: `` Because that night , sir , I were as full as a tick when I started .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 20]: Lord love you , it must ` ave poured out of me afterwards when I started fightin ' coppers .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 19]: Mr. White , ' e knows , I ai n't no fightin ' man as a rule . ''
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 7]: `` And the _ lady _ ?
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 6]: Did you see her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 42]: Leastways , I seed a bundle which I took to be a lydy , but her face was covered up with a shawl , and she was lyin ' ` eavy in ` is arms as though she was mortal bad .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 9]: He tell 'd me she was sick . ''
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 4]: `` Did he ?
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 4]: Anything else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 6]: `` No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 10]: `` Are you sure it was a shawl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 26]: A vacuous smile spread over Foxey 's countenance as he answered , `` I ai n't sure of anythink that ` appened that night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 26]: `` But were you not surprised when a man hired your cab under such peculiar circumstances , and paid you such a high fare ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 10]: `` We four-wheelers are surprised at nothink , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 11]: You do n't know all wot goes on in kebs .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 23]: Why , once crossin ' Waterloo Bridge -- '' `` Never mind Waterloo Bridge , Foxey , '' put in the detective .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 17]: `` Keep your wits fixed on as much as you can remember of November 6 . ''
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 11]: `` Where did he tell you to drive to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 4]: went on Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 4]: `` Just Putney .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 8]: I was to drive my ` ardest .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 31]: I recollect wantin ' to pull up at the Three Bells , but ' e put ` is ` ead out an ' said , ` Go on , driver .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 7]: I am awfully late already . '
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 6]: So on I went . ''
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 7]: `` Where did you stop ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 12]: `` I do n't know no more than the child unborn .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 12]: By that time the drink was yeastin ' up in me .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 14]: The fare kept me on the road ' e wanted by shoutin ' .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 14]: When we pulled up , ' e carries ` er into a lane .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 8]: There was a big ` ouse there .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 6]: I know that all right .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 13]: After a bit ' e comes back and tips me a fiver .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 17]: With that I whips up the old ` oss and gets back to the Three Bells .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 43]: You know the rest , as the girl said when she axed the Bench to -- '' `` Yes , we know the rest , '' interrupted Bruce , `` but I fear you are not able to help us much . ''
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 16]: `` This is n't a five-pun ' job , eh , guv ` nor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 4]: said Foxey anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 5]: `` Hardly at present .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 4]: We shall see .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 19]: Can you say exactly where you drew up your cab when the lady was carried into it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 21]: `` Sure as death , '' replied the cabman , in the hope that his information might yet be valuable .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 11]: `` It was outside Raleigh Mansions , Sloane Square . ''
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 31]: `` We know that -- '' `` It seems to me , sir , as ye know as much about the business as I do , '' broke in Marsh .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 12]: `` Were you in the Square or in Sloane Street ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 8]: `` In Sloane Street , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 7]: Right away from the Square . ''
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 10]: `` Not so very far away , surely . ''
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 4]: Foxey was doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 14]: His memory was hazy , and he feared lest he should be mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 22]: `` No , no , '' he said quickly , `` not far , but still well in the street . ''
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 8]: `` Were there many people about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 16]: `` You could ` ardly tell , sir ; it was that foggy and nasty .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 18]: If the lydy ` ad bin dead nobody would ` ave noticed ` er that night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 17]: `` Did any one besides yourself see the gentleman carrying the lady into the cab ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 5]: `` I think not .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 12]: I do n't remember anybody passin ' at the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 20]: `` Did the gentleman keep your cab waiting long at the kerb before he brought the lady out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 13]: `` It might ` a ' bin a minute or two ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 5]: `` No longer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 31]: `` Well , sir , it 's ` ard for me to say , especially after bein ' away for a change of ` ealth , so to speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 13]: `` Did not the lady speak or move in any manner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 11]: `` Not so far as I know , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 26]: `` And do you mean to tell me that , although you had been drinking , you were not astonished at the whole business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 19]: `` I never axes my fares any questions ` cept when they says ` By the hour . '
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 9]: Then I wants to know a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 26]: `` Yes ; but this carrying of a lady out of a house in such fashion -- did not this strike you as strange ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 10]: `` Strange , bless your ` eart , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 31]: You ought to see me cartin ' 'em off from the Daffodil Club after a big night -- three and four in one keb , all blind , paralytic . ''
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 14]: `` No doubt ; but this was not the Daffodil Club at daybreak .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 19]: It was a respectable neighborhood at seven o'clock , or thereabouts , on a winter 's evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 12]: `` It ai n't my fault , '' said Foxey doggedly .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 8]: `` Wot was wrong with the lydy ?
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 6]: Was it a habduction ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 12]: `` The lady was dead -- murdered , we believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 9]: The cabman 's face grew livid with anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 24]: `` Oh , crikey , Mr. White , '' he cried , addressing the detective , `` I knew nothink about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 14]: `` No one says you did , Foxey , '' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 6]: `` Do n't be frightened .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 24]: We just want you to help us as far as you can , and not to get skeered and lose your wits . ''
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 39]: Thus reassured , Marsh mopped his head and said solemnly : `` I will do wot lies in my power , gentlemen both , but I wish I ` ad n't bin so blamed drunk that night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 18]: `` You say you would not recognize your fare if you saw him , '' continued Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 23]: `` Could you tell us , if you were shown a certain person , that he was _ not _ the man ?
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 21]: You might not be sure of the right man , but you might be sure regarding the wrong one . ''
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 24]: It was n't you , and it was n't Mr. White , and it was n't a lot of other people I know .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 32]: I think if I saw the man who really got into my keb , I would be able to swear that ' e was like him , at any rate . ''
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 4]: `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 7]: That will do for the present .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 15]: Leave us your address , so that we may find you again if necessary .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 8]: Here is a sovereign for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 11]: When Marsh had gone , Bruce turned to the detective .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 25]: `` Well , '' he said , `` if Mensmore were here now , I suppose you would want to lock him up . ''
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 22]: `` No , '' admitted White sadly ; `` the more I learn about this affair the more mixed it becomes .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 23]: Still , I do n't deny but I shall be glad to have Mensmore 's explanation of his movements at that time .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 9]: And so will you , Mr. Bruce . ''
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 15]: CHAPTER XXII A WILFUL MURDER Bruce sent a telegram to Mrs. Hillmer at Paris .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 38]: `` Matters satisfactorily arranged pending your arrival , '' he wired , and early on Monday morning he received a reply : `` Due Charing Cross 7.30 P.M. Will drive straight to your chambers with my brother .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 5]: `` GWENDOLINE HILLMER . ''
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 17]: He forwarded the message with a note to the detective , asking him to be present .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 7]: About one o'clock Corbett turned up .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 20]: `` Guess I slept well last night after the excitement , '' he said , with a pleasant smile .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 24]: `` You seemed to skeer those chaps more with a few words , Mr. Bruce , than I did with a revolver . ''
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 23]: `` The English police are not so much afraid of revolvers as they are of making mistakes , '' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 7]: `` Now , is that so ?
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 11]: On our side they would n't have stopped to argy .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 12]: Both of 'em would have drawn on me at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 22]: `` Then I am glad , for everybody 's sake , Mr. Corbett , that the affair happened in London . ''
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 5]: `` Why , sure .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 4]: But tell me .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 11]: Has my friend Mensmore been getting himself into trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 8]: `` Not so much as it looks .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 27]: Others appear to have involved him without his knowledge , and he has lent color to the accusations by involuntary actions of a suspicious nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 18]: `` Well , if it is permissible , I should like to hear the straight story . ''
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 52]: Under the circumstances , Bruce thought that this stranger from America had a right to know why he was in danger of being arrested during his first twenty-four hours ' residence in the country , so he gave him a succinct narrative of the _ prima facie _ case against Mensmore .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 8]: Corbett listened in silence to the recital .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 19]: When it ended he said : `` Mr. Bruce , my friend was incapable of murdering any woman .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 15]: He was equally incapable of conducting any discreditable _ liaison _ with any woman .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 20]: I have known him for years , and a straighter , truer , more honorable man I never met .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 37]: I do n't know what his reason was for assuming my name , which he undoubtedly did , as the agent called this morning , and I find the flat is taken in my name . ''
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 7]: `` What did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 11]: `` Oh , just that Mensmore had acted for me .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 31]: The man seemed a bit puzzled , but he did n't kick when I offered to pay up the rent owing since Christmas , and another quarter in advance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 8]: `` I do n't suppose he did .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 8]: The rent was due , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 32]: It seems that Mensmore , writing in my name , sent a letter from Monte Carlo a month ago , saying he would return about this time and settle up . ''
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 13]: `` Thus proving his intention all along to come back to London .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 14]: It is a queer muddle , Mr. Corbett , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 28]: `` Very ; but you will pardon me , as an outsider , saying one thing -- you all appear to have overlooked a clear trail . ''
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 7]: `` And what is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 6]: `` What about Mrs. Hillmer ?
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 4]: Who is she ?
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 5]: Who are her friends ?
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 7]: Who maintains her in such style ?
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 12]: Bertie was with me four years and never mentioned her name .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 32]: She could not have been rich by inheritance , as it was on account of their father going broke that Mensmore had to leave the Army and come to the States .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 20]: It strikes me , Mr. Bruce , that the woman knows more about this affair than the man . ''
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 6]: `` You may be right .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 30]: But do not forget the absolute proofs we possess that the crime occurred in Mensmore 's chambers , and the extraordinary coincidence that he left England immediately afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 7]: `` I am not forgetting anything .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 6]: Those facts tell both ways .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 21]: Just because he quitted the country at the time somebody may have tried to throw the blame on him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 12]: The theory was plausible , though Bruce could not accept it .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 20]: Nevertheless , after Corbett had taken his departure he could not help thinking about his references to Mrs. Hillmer .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 39]: That there was force in them he could not deny , and with the admission came the unpleasant thought that perhaps he , Bruce , was in some sense responsible for the neglect to clear up her antecedents .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 9]: However , a few hours might explain much .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 11]: With unwonted impatience the barrister awaited the coming of night .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 14]: He tried every expedient to kill time , and found each operation tedious .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 20]: He dined early , and as half-past seven came and passed he wondered why the detective did not appear .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 11]: But his doubts on this point did not last long .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 20]: `` White is looking at Charing Cross to make sure of their arrival , '' he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 11]: At ten minutes to eight the detective came in hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 11]: `` They will be here directly , '' he announced .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 29]: `` A servant has taken their luggage to Mrs. Hillmer 's place , and they are evidently driving straight here after taking some refreshment at the station . ''
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 12]: `` Have you no faith in human nature , Mr. White ?
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 8]: Could you not trust their words ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 22]: `` Well , sir , my experience of human nature is that you can very seldom trust anybody 's word . ''
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 10]: At last Smith announced Mrs. Hillmer and Mr. Mensmore .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 19]: When they entered Bruce was for the moment at a loss to know exactly how to receive them .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 20]: But Mrs. Hillmer settled the matter by greeting him with a quiet `` Good-evening , '' and seating herself .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 11]: Mensmore stood near the door , very pale and stern-looking .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 22]: `` It appears , Mr. Bruce , '' he said , `` that we met in Monte Carlo under false pretences .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 30]: You were , it seems , a detective on the track of a murderer , and you were good enough to believe that I was the person you sought .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 18]: It would have saved some misconception on my part had you explained our _ rôles _ earlier .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 12]: However , I am here , to meet the charge . ''
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 12]: Claude was not unprepared for this attitude on Mensmore 's part .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 15]: But he was determined that it should not continue if he could help it .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 21]: `` When we parted at Monte Carlo , Mensmore , '' he said , `` we parted as friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 20]: `` Then tell me what has happened since to cause this obvious change in your opinion of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 15]: `` Is it not true that you suspect me of murdering Lady Dyke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 21]: `` But why has my sister been told that I ran serious risk of being apprehended on that account ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 33]: `` Because we certainly did suspect a mysterious personage who called himself Sydney H. Corbett , and whose behavior was so unaccountable that the authorities required a reasonable explanation of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 25]: `` Do I understand , Bruce , that we meet with no more suspicion between us than when we last saw each other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 5]: `` Most certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 12]: `` Then I ask your pardon for my manner and words .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 14]: I have suffered keenly during the last three days from this cruel thought .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 8]: Let us shake hands on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 13]: As their hands met they both heard Mrs. Hillmer stifle a sob .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 5]: Mensmore turned to her .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 15]: `` Now , Gwen , '' he said , `` do n't be foolish .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 9]: We will soon clear up this miserable business .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 22]: So far as we are concerned , all we need to do is to tell the truth and fear nobody . ''
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 9]: `` That 's it , '' said White .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 14]: `` If you adopt that course the matter will soon be ended . ''
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 6]: Mensmore turned to the speaker .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 13]: He guessed his identity , but Bruce introduced the detective by name .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 16]: `` Well , '' said Mensmore , `` I have come here to answer questions .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 9]: What is it you want to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 12]: Mr. White glanced at the barrister , and the other explained .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 28]: `` I have , as you may already realize , taken more than a passive interest in this inquiry , so the questioning largely devolves on me .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 13]: First , tell me why you adopted the name of Corbett ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 11]: `` Simply enough , though stupid , I now admit .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 31]: When I returned from the States I was very hard up , but managed to pick up a subsistence by writing for the sporting press , and occasionally backing horses .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 20]: But I knew this could not last , so I tried to secure some financial interests in the City .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 28]: In doing so I made the acquaintance of a man named Dodge , and committed myself to the underwriting of a new venture named the Springbok Mine .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 15]: This fell through at the time , and with this collapse came other demands .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 48]: I hate being worried by creditors , so when my sister offered to take and furnish a flat for me , near her own , I thought I would live quietly for a time and conceal my name so as to have peace there at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 29]: Therefore , I assumed the name of a friend in America , little thinking that I should land both him and myself into such trouble by doing it .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 5]: That is the explanation .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 11]: By the way , what has happened to Corbett ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 6]: `` He is all right .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 7]: He expects to see you to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 11]: You know Sir Charles Dyke , do you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 4]: `` Intimately ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 8]: `` Well , no , not exactly .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 16]: He and I were at school together at Brighton , at Childe 's place . ''
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 5]: `` At Brighton ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 11]: I was a little chap when Dyke was a senior .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 29]: After he left , the headmaster changed the school to a place called Seton Lodge , at Putney , on account of cramming operations for Army exams . ''
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 8]: `` Then you were at Putney ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 8]: `` Yes , for two years . ''
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 7]: `` And Dyke was not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 10]: `` No ; that I am sure of . ''
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 11]: `` Have you and Sir Charles been friendly since ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 26]: Mensmore 's face hardened somewhat as he answered , `` I have seen very little of him , and hardly ever spoken to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 3]: `` Why ?
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 5]: Did you quarrel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 12]: `` N-no , but we just did not happen to meet .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 20]: Bear in mind , I was in business some years ago , and I am not yet thirty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 8]: `` Did you know his wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 13]: `` I have never , to my knowledge , seen her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 24]: `` How , then , can you account for the fact that she visited your flat at Raleigh Mansions on November 6 . ''
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 12]: `` I say that such a statement is mere nonsense . ''
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 9]: `` But if it can be proved ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 6]: `` It can not . ''
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 14]: `` I assure you , on my honor , that it can . ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 7]: `` But look here , Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 8]: Why should she come to see me ?
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 11]: I question greatly if she knew of my existence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 9]: `` Nevertheless , it is the fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 10]: `` I can only tell you it is not .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 17]: I left London on November 8 , and on the two previous evenings I dined alone .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 39]: Mrs. Robinson , my housekeeper , can tell you that not another soul entered my flat for a week prior to my departure , except my sister and -- and -- I had forgotten -- some workmen . ''
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 5]: `` Some workmen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 11]: `` Yes ; some fellows from a furniture warehouse . ''
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 7]: `` What were they doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 42]: `` Well , do n't you see , I told you I was not well off , and my sister furnished my flat for me , in August last that was , but the drawing-room was left bare for a time .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 21]: Just before I left for France she decided to refurnish her drawing-room , and she gave me the whole fit-out .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 14]: The things were brought in by the men who brought her purchases . ''
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 13]: At this astounding revelation Bruce and the detective were utterly taken aback .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 13]: It was with difficulty that the barrister enunciated his next words clearly .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 18]: `` Can you tell me with absolute certainty the date of this change of the furniture ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 4]: `` Oh yes .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 19]: It was the day before I started for the Riviera ; that must have been November 7 . ''
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 8]: `` Are you positive of this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 3]: `` Undoubtedly .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 7]: Is it a matter of importance ?
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 8]: Gwen , you know all about it .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 24]: Besides , the bills for your new furniture will show the exact date of delivery , and it was the same day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 15]: Mrs. Hillmer 's face was hidden by her veil , but she nodded silently .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 28]: Three people in the room knew the significance of Mensmore 's straightforward words ; he alone was unaware of the direction towards which the investigation now tended .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 30]: `` Let us analyze the matter carefully , '' said Bruce , who had recovered his self-possession , though he was almost terrified at the possibilities of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 18]: `` Did the whole of the contents of your drawing-room come from your sister 's flat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 4]: `` Every stick .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 11]: There was nothing there before but the bare boards . ''
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 14]: `` Do you remember a handsome ornamental fender being among these articles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 3]: `` Perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 11]: My housekeeper said the men broke it during the transit .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 18]: They denied this , and looked for the piece chipped off , but could not find it .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 9]: She told me about it that night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 10]: `` Did you mention it to Mrs. Hillmer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 17]: To tell the honest truth , Gwen and I had quarrelled a couple of days before .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 27]: That is to say , we disagreed seriously about a certain matter , and it was this which led to my making off to Monte Carlo .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 16]: Therefore it was hardly likely I should mention such a trivial matter to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 10]: `` May I ask what you quarrelled about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 29]: `` I have told her since that it ought to be made known , but she has implored me not to reveal it , so I can not .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 21]: But she will tell you herself that we agreed I should be at liberty to make this guarded explanation . ''
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 10]: Bruce and the detective exchanged glances of wondering comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 19]: `` I do not think we need question Mr. Mensmore further , '' said the barrister to White .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 8]: `` No , '' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 7]: `` The matter is clear enough .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 23]: Mrs. Hillmer must tell us how that furniture came to be transferred from her premises on the morning of the 7th . ''
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 6]: `` If she chooses . ''
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 18]: The barrister 's tone was sad , and its ominous significance was not lost on his hearers .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 6]: Mrs. Hillmer raised her veil .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 12]: Her face was deathly pale and tense in its fixed agony .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 23]: But in her eyes was a light which gave a curious aspect of resolve to her otherwise painful aspect of utter grief .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 25]: `` I do not choose , '' she said quietly , looking , not at Bruce or the detective , but at her brother .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 8]: For a little while no one spoke .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 15]: Mensmore at last broke out eagerly : `` Do n't act absurdly , Gwen .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 54]: I can not even guess where all this talk about the furniture is leading us , but I do know that you are as innocent of any complicity in Lady Dyke 's death as I am , so it is better for you to help forward the inquiry than to retard it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 25]: `` I am not innocent , '' said Mrs. Hillmer , her words falling with painful distinctness upon the ears of the three men .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 5]: `` Heaven help me !
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 7]: I am responsible for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 14]: Her brother started to his feet , and caught her by the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 10]: `` What folly is this , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 10]: `` Do you know what you are saying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 3]: `` Fully .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 6]: My words are like sledge-hammers .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 7]: I will forever feel their weight .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 14]: I tell you I am responsible for the death of Lady Dyke . ''
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 11]: `` Then how did she die , Mrs. Hillmer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 11]: said Bruce , whose glance sought to read her soul .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 6]: `` I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 7]: I do not want to know .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 7]: It matters little to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 15]: `` In other words , you are assuming a responsibility you should not bear .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 16]: You were not even aware of this poor lady 's death until I told you .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 25]: Why should you seek to avert suspicion from others merely because Lady Dyke is shown to have met her death in your apartments ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 8]: `` But how is it shown ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 4]: interrupted Mensmore vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 22]: He was more disturbed by his sister 's unaccountable attitude than he had ever been by the serious charge against himself .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 20]: `` Easily enough , '' said White , feeling that he ought to have some share in the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 25]: `` A piece of the damaged fender placed in your rooms , Mr. Mensmore , was found in the murdered lady 's head . ''
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 5]: `` Was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 18]: `` Then , by Heaven , I refuse to see my sister sacrificed for anybody 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 13]: She has borne too long the whole burden of misery and degradation .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 21]: I tell you , Gwen , that if you do not save yourself I will save you against your will .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 30]: That furniture came to my room because -- '' `` Bertie , I beseech you , for the sake of the woman you love , to spare me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 25]: Mrs. Hillmer flung herself on her knees before him and caught hold of his hands , while she burst into a storm of tears .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 4]: Mensmore was unnerved .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 19]: He turned to Bruce , and said : `` Help me in this miserable business , old chap .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 25]: I do n't know what to say or do ; my sister had no more connection with Lady Dyke 's death than I had .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 16]: This statement on her part is mere hysteria , arising from other circumstances altogether . ''
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 11]: `` That I feel acutely , '' said the barrister .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 33]: `` Yet some one killed her , and , whatever the pain that may be caused , and whoever may suffer , I am determined that the truth shall come out . ''
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 22]: `` I tell you , '' wailed Mrs. Hillmer between her sobs , `` that I must bear all the blame .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 5]: Why do you hesitate ?
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 14]: She was killed in my house , and I confess my guilt . ''
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 17]: `` This _ is _ rum business , '' growled Mr. White aloud , half unconsciously .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 12]: At that moment the door opened unexpectedly , and Smith entered .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 48]: Before Bruce had time to vociferate an order to his astounded servitor the man stuttered an excuse : `` Beg pardon , sir , '' he said , `` but Sir Charles Dyke has called , and wants to know if you will be disengaged soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 52]: CHAPTER XXIII THE LETTER Quick on the heels of the footman 's stammered explanation came the voice of Sir Charles himself : `` Sorry to disturb you , Bruce , if you are busy , but I must see you for a moment on a matter of the utmost importance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 11]: There was that in his utterance which betokened great excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 11]: He was not visible to the occupants of the room .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 24]: During the audible silence that followed his words , they could hear him stamping about the passage , impatiently awaiting Bruce 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 8]: Mrs. Hillmer quietly collapsed on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 4]: She had fainted .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 38]: The barrister rushed out , calling for Mrs. Smith , and responding to Sir Charles Dyke 's proffered statement as to the reason for his presence by the startling cry : `` Wait a bit , Dyke .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 9]: There 's a lady in a faint inside .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 9]: We must attend to her at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 24]: Mrs. Smith , fortunately , was at hand , and with the help of her ministrations , Mrs. Hillmer gradually regained her senses .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 27]: After a whispered colloquy with White , the barrister said to Mensmore : `` You must remove your sister to her residence as quickly as possible .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 13]: She is far too highly strung to bear any further questioning to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 29]: Perhaps to-morrow , when you and she have discussed matters fully together , you may be able to send for us and clear up this wretched business . ''
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 8]: For answer Mensmore silently pressed his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 22]: With the help of the housekeeper he led his sister from the room , passing Sir Charles Dyke in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 31]: The baronet politely turned aside , and Mensmore did not look at him , being far too engrossed with his sister to pay heed to aught else at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 22]: As for Mrs. Hillmer , she was in such a state of collapse as to be practically unconscious of her surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 19]: She managed to murmur at the door : `` Where are you taking me to , Bertie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 6]: `` Home , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 3]: `` Home ?
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 6]: Oh , thank Heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 25]: They all heard her , and even the detective was constrained to say : `` Poor thing , she need n't have been afraid .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 9]: She is suffering for some one else . ''
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 8]: Sir Charles Dyke grasped Bruce 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 9]: `` What on earth is going on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 15]: `` Merely a foolish woman worrying herself about others , '' replied Bruce grimly .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 15]: `` But those people were my old friends , Mensmore and his sister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 8]: `` What are they doing here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 26]: `` Mensmore has been brought back to London by Mrs. Hillmer to face the allegations made against him with regard to your wife 's disappearance .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 32]: They came here by their own appointment , and -- '' `` Did I not tell you that this charge against Mensmore was wild folly on the face of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 36]: `` So it seems , when we have just discovered that your wife was killed in his sister 's house , and Mrs. Hillmer persists in declaring that she was responsible for the crime . ''
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 6]: `` Look here , Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 15]: Do n't lose your head like everybody else mixed up in this wretched business .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 7]: My wife is not dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 19]: The cry was a double one , for both Bruce and White gave simultaneous utterance to their amazement .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 5]: `` It is true .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 7]: She is alive all the time .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 9]: I have had a letter from her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 4]: `` A letter .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 13]: Surely , Dyke -- '' `` I am neither mad nor drunk .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 10]: The letter reached me by this morning 's post .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 12]: I came here with it as fast as I could travel .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 17]: I have been in the train all day , and am nearly fainting from hunger . ''
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 6]: `` Where is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 3]: cried White .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 6]: `` Is it genuine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 12]: `` I could swear to her writing amidst a thousand letters .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 4]: Here it is .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 28]: I have brought some old correspondence of hers for the purpose of comparison , as I could hardly believe my eyes when I first received it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 24]: Bruce was so dumfounded by this remarkable development that he could but mutely take the document produced by the baronet and read it .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 35]: He himself recognized Lady Dyke 's handwriting , which he had often seen -- a clear , bold , well-defined script , more like the caligraphy of a banker than of a fashionable lady .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 53]: The letter was dated February 1 , bore no other superscription , and read as follows : '' _ My Dear Charles _ , -- I have just seen in the newspapers the announcement of my death , and the theories set on foot to account for my disappearance on November 6 .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 28]: This seems to convey to me the strange fact that you have not received the explanation I sent you of my reasons for leaving London so suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 11]: Otherwise you must have kept your own counsel very closely .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 46]: However , I do not now desire to reopen the question of motive ; let it suffice to say that no one save myself was responsible for my disappearance , and that neither you nor any one acquainted with me will ever see me again .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 12]: Do not search for me ; it will be time wasted .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 17]: If you have legal proof of my death and wish to marry again , be satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 8]: Tear up this letter and forget it .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 11]: I am dead -- to you and to the world .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 33]: You can neither refuse to accept the genuineness of this letter nor trace me by reason of it , as I have taken such precautions that the latter course will be impossible .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 7]: Let me repeat -- forget me .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 4]: `` ALICE . ''
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 29]: The barrister carefully refolded the sheet after scrutinizing the water-mark against the light , and noting that the paper was British made ; he then examined the envelope .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 17]: The obliterating postmark was `` London , February 4 , 9 P.M. , West Strand . ''
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 12]: The office of delivery was `` Wensley , February 6 . ''
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 14]: `` Posted at the West Strand Post-Office on Saturday , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 18]: `` Detained in London all Sunday , and delivered to you this morning in the North . ''
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 4]: `` Exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 14]: `` It was written three days earlier , if the date be accurate .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 9]: So the writer is somewhere in Europe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 13]: `` That 's how I take it , '' said Sir Charles .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 10]: `` Unless the whole thing is a fraud . ''
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 8]: `` How can it be a fraud ?
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 8]: I am sure as to the handwriting .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 19]: Why , even yourself , Bruce , must have a good recollection of my wife 's style . ''
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 3]: `` Undoubtedly .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 15]: No man born could swear that this was not Lady Dyke 's production . ''
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 10]: `` Well , what are we to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 19]: `` And what did Mrs. Hillmer mean by kicking up that fuss when we spoke to her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 3]: interpolated White .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 41]: `` I 'll take my oath that some one was killed in her house , else how comes it that a woman found in the Thames at Putney is carrying about in her head some of Mrs. Hillmer 's ironwork ?
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 9]: I wish she had n't fainted just now .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 28]: Why , she said herself that she was the cause of Lady Dyke 's death , and here is Lady Dyke writing to say she is alive .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 25]: This business is beyond me , but Mrs. Hillmer has got to explain a good deal yet before I am done with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 20]: The detective 's wrath at this check in the hunt after a criminal did not appeal to the baronet .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 44]: `` You can please yourself , Mr. White , of course , '' he said coldly ; `` but so far as I am concerned , I will respect my wife 's wishes , and let the matter rest where it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 17]: `` My dear fellow , '' said the barrister , `` such a course is impossible .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 15]: Assuming that her ladyship is really alive , why did she leave you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 6]: `` How can I tell ?
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 8]: She herself refuses to give a reason .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 16]: She apparently stated one in a letter which never reached me , as you know .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 16]: She has selfishly caused me a world of suffering and misery for three long months .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 11]: I refuse to be plagued in the matter further . ''
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 7]: Sir Charles was excited and angry .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 8]: He was in bitter revolt against circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 15]: `` Do you intend to show this letter to Lady Dyke 's relatives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 15]: asked Bruce , at a loss for the time to discuss the situation coherently .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 6]: `` I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 5]: What would you advise ?
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 7]: I trust fully to your judgment .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 10]: But is it not better to obey her wishes ?
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 10]: -- to forget , as she puts it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 7]: `` We must decide nothing hastily .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 9]: I am perplexed beyond endurance by this business .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 13]: There is so much that is wildly impossible in its irreconcilable features .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 5]: I must have time .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 11]: Will you give me a copy of the letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 7]: `` Certainly , keep it yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 7]: We have all seen it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 5]: `` Thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 11]: Bruce placed the envelope and its contents in his pocket-book .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 21]: Then , turning to the detective , he said : `` Now , Mr. White , do me a favor .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 12]: Do not worry Mrs. Hillmer until you hear from me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 8]: `` By all means , Mr. Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 30]: But am I to report to the Commissioner that Lady Dyke has been found , or has , at any rate , explained that she is not dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 17]: `` There is no immediate necessity why a report of any kind should be made . ''
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 4]: `` None . ''
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 11]: `` Then leave matters where they are at present . ''
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 10]: `` But why , '' put in Sir Charles .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 20]: `` Is it not better to end all inquiries , at least so far as my wife is concerned ?
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 24]: It is her desire , and , I may add , my own , now that I know something of her fate . ''
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 18]: `` Of course , if you wish it , Dyke , I have no valid objection . ''
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 7]: `` Oh , no , no .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 9]: Do not look at it in that way .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 10]: I leave the ultimate decision entirely to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 16]: `` In that case , I recommend complete silence in all quarters at present . ''
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 22]: The detective left them , and as he passed out into Victoria Street his philosophy could find but one comprehensive dictum .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 21]: `` This _ is _ a rum go , '' he muttered , unconsciously plagiarizing himself on many previous occasions .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 14]: The baronet sat down , and meditatively chewed the handle of his umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 19]: `` What is this nonsense Mensmore 's sister talked about being responsible for my wife 's death ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 12]: `` I do not pretend to understand , '' answered Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 20]: `` Little more than a week ago she learned for the first time of your wife 's supposed murder .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 7]: Of that I am quite positive .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 31]: She feared that her brother was implicated , and , without trusting me with the reasons for her belief , took the measures she thought best to safeguard him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 4]: `` Took measures !
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 3]: What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 8]: Sir Charles jerked the words out impetuously .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 16]: `` She followed him to the South of France , and found him in Florence .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 17]: What she said I can not guess , but the result was their visit here to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 57]: During our interview it came out , quite by accident , that some furniture was taken from her place to her brother 's on the morning of November 7 , thus shifting the venue of Lady Dyke 's death -- or imaginary death I must now say -- from No. 12 Raleigh Mansions to No. 61 .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 41]: This discovery was as startling to Mrs. Hillmer as to us , for she forthwith protested that the whole affair arose from her fault , and practically asked the detective to arrest her on the definite charge of murder . ''
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 3]: `` Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 8]: The mania of an hysterical woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 4]: `` Possibly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 6]: `` Why ` possibly ' ?
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 8]: No one was murdered in her abode .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 11]: Do you for a moment believe the monstrous insinuation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 8]: `` No , not in that sense .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 22]: But her brother was about to make some revelation regarding a third person when she appealed to him not to speak .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 10]: What would have happened finally I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 11]: At that critical moment my servant announced your arrival . ''
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 10]: `` But what can Mrs. Hillmer have to conceal ?
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 15]: She and her brother have been lost to Society since long before my marriage .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 24]: Neither of them , so far as I know , has ever set eyes on my wife during the last seven years . ''
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 19]: `` Yet Mrs. Hillmer _ must _ have had some powerful motive in acting as she did . ''
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 17]: `` Is it not more than likely that she had a bad attack of nerves ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 12]: `` A woman who merely yields to nervous prostration behaves foolishly .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 24]: This woman gave way to emotion , it is true , but it was strength , not weakness , that sustained her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 7]: `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 18]: `` There is but one force that sustains in such a crisis -- the power of love .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 8]: Mrs. Hillmer was not flying from consequences .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 13]: She met them half-way in the spirit of a martyr . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 23]: ` Pon my honor , Bruce , I am beginning to think that this wretched business is affecting your usually clear brain .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 8]: You are accepting fancies as facts . ''
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 3]: `` Maybe .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 13]: I confess I am unable to form a logical conclusion to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 10]: `` Why not abandon the whole muddle to time ?
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 11]: There is no solution of a difficulty like the almanac .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 8]: Let us both go off somewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 15]: `` What , and leave Mrs. Hillmer to die of sheer pain of mind ?
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 19]: Let this unfortunate fellow , Mensmore , suffer no one knows what consequences from the events of to-day ?
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 8]: It is out of the question . ''
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 10]: `` Very well , I leave it to you .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 14]: Every one seems to forget that it is I who suffer most . ''
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 11]: The baronet stood up and dejectedly gazed into the fire .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 37]: `` I , at least , can feel for you , Dyke , '' said Bruce sympatherically , `` but you must admit that things can not be allowed to remain in their present whirlpool . ''
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 5]: `` So be it .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 9]: Let them go on to their bitter end .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 23]: If my wife was tired of my society she might at least have got rid of me in an easier manner . ''
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 12]: With this trite reflection Sir Charles quitted his friend 's house .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 8]: Bruce sat motionless for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 32]: Then , as his mind became calmer , he lit a cigar , took out the doubly mysterious letter , and examined it in every possible way , critically and microscopically .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 12]: There could be no doubt that it was a genuine production .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 32]: The condition of the ink bore out the correctness of the date , and the fact that the note paper and envelope were not of Continental style was not very material .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 26]: It did not appear to have been enclosed in another envelope , as the writer implied , for the purpose of being re-posted in London .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 24]: Rather did the slightly frayed edges give rise to the assumption that it had been carried in some one 's pocket before postage .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 8]: But this theory was vague and undemonstrable .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 32]: The handwriting was Lady Dyke 's ; the style , allowing for the strange conditions under which it was written , was hers ; yet Bruce did not believe in it .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 38]: Nothing could shake his faith in the one solid , concrete certainty that stood out from a maze of contradictions and mystery -- Lady Dyke was dead , and buried in a pauper 's grave at Putney .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 59]: At last , wearied with thought and theorizing , he went to bed ; but Smith sat up late to regale his partner with the full , true , and particular narrative of the `` lydy a-cryin ' on her knees , and the strange gent lookin ' as though he would like to murder Mr. White . ''
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 26]: CHAPTER XXIV THE HANDWRITING Like most men , Claude took a different view of events in the morning to that which he entertained over night .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 16]: Yesterday , the surprises of the hour were concrete embodiments , each distinct and emphatic .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 19]: To-day they were merged in the general mass of contradictory details that made up this most bewildering inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 39]: That matters could not be allowed to rest in their present state was clear ; that they would , in the natural course of things , reveal themselves more definitely , even if unaided , was also patent .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 61]: Mrs. Hillmer 's partial admissions , her brother 's evident knowledge of some salient features of the puzzle , that utterly strange letter in the admitted handwriting of Lady Dyke herself , and bearing the prosaic testimony of dates stamped by the Post-office -- these sensational elements , when brought into juxtaposition , could not avoid reaction into clearer phases .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 23]: Long experience in criminal investigation told him that , under certain circumstances , the best course of all was one of inactivity .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 45]: On the basis of the accepted truism in the affairs of many people that `` letters left unanswered answer themselves , '' the barrister knew that there must be an outcome from the queer medley of occurrences at his residence on the Monday evening .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 18]: Reviewing the history of the past three months several odd features stood out from the general jumble .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 38]: In the first place , he wondered why he had failed to deduce any pertinent fact from the manner in which Mrs. Hillmer 's dining-room was furnished on the occasion of his first visit to Raleigh Mansions .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 29]: He distinctly remembered noting his reception in an unusual room littered with unusual articles , when the luxurious and well-appointed suite of apartments was considered as a whole .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 62]: It was suggested to him at the time that the drawing-room , which he saw during his second visit , was dismantled earlier , but he did not connect this trivial incident with the feature in Mensmore 's flat that he noted immediately -- namely , the discrepancies between the arrangement of the sitting-room and the other chambers in the place .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 17]: These things were immaterial now , but he indexed them as a guide for future use .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 20]: Lady Dyke 's motive for that secret visit to Raleigh Mansions -- that was the key to the mystery .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 6]: But how to discover it ?
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 5]: Who was her confidant ?
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 9]: To whom could he turn for possible enlightenment ?
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 12]: It was useless to broach the matter again to her husband .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 20]: The baronet and his wife had been friends sharing the same _ ménage _ rather than husband and wife .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 10]: Her relatives had already been appealed to in vain .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 13]: They knew nothing of the slightest value in this search for truth .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 13]: In this train of thought the name of Jane Harding cropped up .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 10]: She was the personal maid of the deceased lady .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 8]: She had sharp eyes and quick wits .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 11]: Her queer antics shortly after the inquest were not forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 14]: Here at least was a possibility of light if the girl would speak .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 9]: If she refused what could be her motive ?
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 11]: Anyhow it was worth while to make a fresh effort .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 14]: Early in the afternoon he called at the stage-door of the Jollity Theatre .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 11]: `` Is Miss Marie le Marchant still employed here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 5]: he asked the attendant .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 10]: `` I dunno , '' was the careless answer .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 34]: `` Well , think hard , '' said the barrister , laying a half-crown on the battered blotting-pad which is an indispensable part of the furniture in the letter bureau of a theatre .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 22]: `` Yes , sir , I believe she is , but she has been away on a week 's leave . ''
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 3]: `` Indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 5]: Has she returned ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 29]: `` I was off last night , sir , but if you will pardon me a moment I 'll inquire from the man who took my place . ''
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 26]: The stage-doorkeeper disappeared into the dark interior , to return quickly with the information that Miss le Marchant had appeared as usual on Monday night .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 43]: `` She was away most part of last week , sir , '' added the man , `` and I believe it was n't a holiday , as she was a-sort of flurried about it as if some one was ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 8]: Do you know where she lives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 10]: A momentary hesitation was soon softened by another half-crown .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 9]: `` It 's against the rules , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 20]: If you were to find yourself near Jubilee Buildings , Bloomsbury , you would not be far out . ''
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 5]: The information was sound .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 13]: Miss Marie le Marchant 's name was painted outside a second-floor flat .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 20]: Bruce knocked , and the door was opened by an elderly woman whom he had no difficulty in recognizing .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 10]: `` Is your daughter in , Mrs. Harding ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 10]: For a moment she could not speak for surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 18]: `` Well , I never , '' she cried , `` but London is a funny place .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 8]: Do you know me , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 25]: `` Any one would recognize you from your daughter , if they did not take you for her elder sister , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 6]: Bruce 's smile was irresistible .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 28]: `` My daughter is not in just now , sir , '' replied Mrs. Harding , `` but I expect her in to tea almost immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 12]: `` Then may I come in and await her arrival ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 6]: `` Certainly , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 55]: Once inside the flat , he was impressed by the pretentious but fairly comfortable nature of its appointments ; the ex-lady 's maid 's legacy must have been a nice one to enable her to live in such style , as the poor pittance of a coryphée would barely pay the rent and taxes .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 18]: Moreover , the presence of her mother in the establishment was a distinct factor in her favor .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 11]: Mrs. Harding had brought the visitor to the tiny sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 11]: She seated herself near the window and resumed some sewing .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 12]: `` Have you been long in town , Mrs. Harding ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 9]: he said , by way of being civil .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 10]: `` In London , do you mean , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 4]: About two months .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 13]: Ever since my daughter got along so well in her new profession .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 11]: She 's a good girl , is my daughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 13]: `` Miss Harding is doing well on the stage , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 6]: `` Oh yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 44]: Why , she 's been earning # 6 a week , and last week she was sent for on a special engagement , which paid her so well that she 's going to buy me a new dress out of the money . ''
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 18]: `` Really , '' said the barrister , `` you ought to be proud of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 10]: `` I am , '' admitted the admiring mother .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 25]: `` I only wish her brother , who went off and ` listed for a sojer , had turned out half as well . ''
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 33]: Mrs. Harding nodded towards a photograph of a cavalry soldier in uniform on the mantelshelf , and Bruce rose to examine it , inwardly marvelling at the intelligence he had just received .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 20]: Was it reasonable that the girl could be the recipient of a legacy without the knowledge of her mother ?
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 15]: In any case , why did she conceal the real nature of her earnings ?
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 13]: The story about '' # 6 a week '' was a myth .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 30]: Near to the portrait of the gallant huzzar was a large plaque presentment of Miss Marie herself , in all the glory of tights , wig , and make-up .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 21]: Across it was written , in the best theatrical style , `` Ever yours sincerely , Marie le Marchant . ''
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 19]: And no sooner had Bruce caught sight of the words than he almost shouted aloud in his amazement .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 10]: The handwriting was identical with that of Lady Dyke .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 13]: Gulping down his surprise , he devoured the signature with his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 6]: The resemblance was truly remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 11]: What on earth could be the explanation of this phenomenon .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 22]: `` Your daughter is a remarkably nice writer , Mrs. Harding , '' he said , turning the photograph towards her .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 22]: `` Yes , '' said the complacent mother , `` she taught herself when -- before she went on the stage .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 16]: She was always a clever girl , and when she grew up she improved herself .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 15]: I was n't able to afford her much schooling when she was young . ''
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 14]: `` I have seldom seen a nicer hand , '' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 10]: `` Have you any other specimens of her writing ?
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 13]: I should like to see them if they are not private . ''
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 16]: The smooth surface of the photograph might perhaps lend a deceptive fluency to the pen .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 12]: He wanted to make quite sure that he was not mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 4]: `` Oh yes .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 14]: She 's just copying out the part of Ophelia in _ Hamlet _ .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 7]: And she acts it beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 34]: Mrs. Harding handed over a large MS. book , and there , written on the first page , was the name of the luckless woman whose fatal passion has moved millions to tears .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 33]: He admired Miss Marie le Marchant 's efforts in the matter of self-culture , but he was determined , once for all , to wrest from her some explanation of her actions .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 27]: The rattle of a key in the outer door caused him to throw aside the coveted `` part , '' and the young lady herself entered .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 14]: A few weeks of stage experience had given her a more stylish appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 20]: There was a `` professional '' touch in the arrangement of her hat and the droop of her skirt .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 29]: She knew him instantly , and listened with evident anger to her mother 's explanation that `` this gentleman has just called to see you , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 10]: `` All right , mother , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 8]: `` I see it is Mr. Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 11]: Will you get tea ready while I talk with him ?
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 9]: I shall be ready in two minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 9]: This with a defiant look at the visitor .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 27]: When Mrs. Harding quitted the room her daughter said in the crisp accents of ill-temper : `` What do you want with me , now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 25]: `` I want to ask why you dared to write a letter to Sir Charles Dyke in the name of your dead mistress . ''
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 33]: The answer was so direct , the tone so menacing , its assumption of absolute and unquestioned knowledge so complete , that for a moment Marie le Marchant 's assurance failed her .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 13]: She stood like one petrified , with eyes dilated and breast heaving .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 21]: At last she managed to ejaculate : `` I -- I -- why do you ask me that question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 12]: `` Because I must have the truth from you this time .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 9]: You are playing a very dangerous game . ''
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 11]: That he was right he was sure now beyond doubt .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 27]: It was impossible for the girl to deny it with those piercing eyes fixed on her , and seeming to read the secrets of her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 6]: Yet she was plucky enough .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 24]: Although she was confused and on the point of bursting into tears , she snapped viciously : `` I will tell you nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 4]: Go away . ''
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 26]: `` You are obstinate , I know , '' said Bruce , `` but I must warn you that you are juggling with edged tools .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 11]: You should not imagine that you can trifle with murder .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 14]: What is your motive for deliberately trying to conceal Lady Dyke 's death ?
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 19]: If you do not answer me you may be asked the question in a court of law . ''
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 12]: `` You have no right to come here annoying me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 3]: she retorted .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 9]: `` I am not here to annoy you .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 32]: I come , rather , as a friend , to appeal to you not to incur the grave risk of keeping from the authorities information which they ought to possess . ''
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 5]: `` What information ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 63]: `` The reasons which led you to leave Sir Charles Dyke 's house so suddenly , the source from which you obtain your money , paid to you , doubtless , to secure your silence , the motive which impelled you to use your ability to imitate her ladyship 's handwriting in order to spread the false news that she is alive .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 19]: This is the information needed , and your wilful refusal to give it constitutes a grave indictment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 38]: `` I do n't care _ that _ for you , Mr. Bruce , '' replied the girl , her face set now in a scarlet temper , while she snapped her fingers to emphasize the words .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 17]: `` You can do and say what you like , I will tell you nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 17]: `` You can not deny you wrote that letter to Sir Charles Dyke last Saturday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 8]: `` I am waiting for my tea .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 11]: Sorry I ca n't ask you to join me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 8]: `` Your flippancy will not avail you .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 27]: See , here is the letter itself -- your own production -- written on paper of which you have a quantity in this very room . ''
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 15]: The shot was a bold one , and it very nearly hit the mark .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 28]: She was staggered , almost subdued by this melodramatic production of the original , and his clever guess at the existence of similar notepaper in the house .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 7]: But her dogged temperament saved her .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 24]: Jane Harding was British , notwithstanding her penchant for a French-sounding name , and she would have died sooner than beat a retreat .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 17]: `` I will thank you to leave me alone , Mr. Bruce , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 27]: There was nothing for it but to retire as gracefully as possible , but the barrister was more than satisfied with the result of his visit .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 37]: He had now established beyond a shadow of doubt that for some reason which he could not fathom the ex-lady 's maid not only knew of her mistress 's death , but wished to conceal it .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 32]: This desire , too , had the essential feature of every other branch of the inquiry ; it grew to maturity long after the day when Lady Dyke was actually killed .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 6]: What did it all mean ?
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 25]: From Bloomsbury he strolled west to Portman Square , and found Sir Charles on the point of going for a drive in the Park .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 7]: He briefly told him his discovery .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 7]: The baronet at first was sceptical .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 31]: `` Do you mean to say , Claude , '' he cried , fretfully , `` that I do not know my wife 's writing when I see it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 24]: `` You may think you do , but when another person can imitate it exactly , of course , you may be deceived .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 41]: Besides , if this girl , as is probable , was helped in her education by your wife , what is more likely than that Jane Harding should seek to copy that which she would consider the ideal of excellence .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 11]: Do n't harbor any delusions in the matter , Dyke .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 13]: The letter you received on Monday morning was written by Jane Harding .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 22]: I am sure of that from her manner no less than from the accidental resemblance of the two styles of handwriting .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 14]: What I could not find out was her motive for the deceit . ''
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 22]: `` It is a queer business altogether , '' said Sir Charles wearily ; `` I wish it were ended . ''
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 35]: CHAPTER XXV MISS PHYLLIS BROWNE INTERVENES Bruce was quite positive in his belief that Jane Harding was the paid agent of some person who wished to conceal the facts concerning Lady Dyke 's death .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 26]: Her unexpected appearance in the field at this late hour , no less than the bold _ rôle _ she adopted , proved this conclusively .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 22]: But in England there was no torture-chamber to which she might be led and gradually dismembered until she confessed the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 16]: So long as she adhered to the policy of pert denial she was quite safe .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 42]: The law could not touch her , for the chief witness against her , Sir Charles Dyke , was obviously more than half-inclined to admit the genuineness of the letter , even in opposition to the superior judgment of his friend .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 39]: Yet it was a matter which Bruce considered ought to be made known to the police , so he sent for Mr. White and told him of the strange result of his interview with Miss Marie le Marchant .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 5]: `` Dash everything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 10]: cried the detective , when he heard the news .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 24]: `` I made a note sometime ago that that girl ought to be watched , but I clean forgot all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 18]: `` Remember , '' said Bruce , `` that my discovery was the result of pure accident .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 23]: My object in visiting her was to endeavor to induce her confidence with regard to Lady Dyke 's former life and habits .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 10]: Indeed , I handled the business very badly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 9]: `` I do n't see that , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 38]: You got hold of a very remarkable fact , and thus prevented the success of a bold move by some one which , in my case at any rate , nearly choked me off the inquiry . ''
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 3]: `` True .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 7]: Thus far , chance favored me .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 11]: But I ought to have been content with the assumption .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 13]: There was no need to frighten her by pressing it home . ''
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 14]: `` Oh , from that point of view -- '' began the detective .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 18]: But Bruce was merely thinking aloud -- rough-shaping his ideas as they grouped themselves in his brain .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 13]: `` Perhaps I am wrong there too , '' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 30]: `` If this girl is working to instructions she would have refused to help me in any way , and she already knows that I am on the trail .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 16]: There is one highly satisfactory feature in the Jane Harding adventure , Mr. White . ''
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 7]: `` And what is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 22]: `` The person , or persons , responsible for Lady Dyke 's death know that the matter has not been dropped .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 11]: They are inclined to think that the circle is narrowing .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 36]: In some of our casts , Mr. White , we must have come so unpleasantly close to them , that they deemed it advisable to throw us off the scent by a bold effort . ''
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 32]: `` No doubt you are right , sir , but I wish to goodness I knew when we were ` warm , ' as I am becoming tired of the business .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 8]: Every new development deepens the mystery . ''
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 11]: The detective 's face was as downcast as his words .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 4]: `` Surely not !
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 24]: The more pieces of the puzzle we have to handle the less difficult should be the final task of putting them together . ''
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 13]: `` Not when every piece is a fresh puzzle in itself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 10]: `` Why , what has disconcerted you to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 5]: `` Mrs. Hillmer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 6]: `` What of her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 23]: `` I have had another talk with the maid , -- her companion , you know , -- a girl named Dobson .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 20]: It struck me that it was advisable to know more about Mrs. Hillmer than we do at present . ''
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 25]: Bruce made no comment , but he could not help reflecting that Corbett , the stranger from Wyoming , had entertained the same view .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 32]: `` Well , '' continued the detective , `` I went about the affair as quietly as possible , but the maid , though willing , could not tell me much .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 18]: Mrs. Hillmer , she thinks , married very young , and was badly treated by her husband .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 21]: Finally , there was a rumpus , and she went on the stage , while Hillmer drank himself to death .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 15]: He died a year ago , and they had been separated nearly five years .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 20]: He was fairly well-to-do , but he squandered all his money in dissipation and never gave her a cent .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 23]: Three years last Michaelmas she set up her present establishment at Raleigh Mansions , and there she has been ever since . ''
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 9]: `` Then where does the money come from ?
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 14]: It must cost her at least # 2,000 a year to live . ''
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 12]: `` That 's just what the maid ca n't tell me .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 23]: Her mistress led a very secluded life , and was never what you could call fast , though a very pretty woman .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 13]: During this time she had only one visitor -- a gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 19]: `` It sounds promising , but it ends in smoke , so far as I can see . ''
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 24]: `` This gentleman was a Colonel Montgomery -- an old friend -- though he was n't much turned thirty , the maid says .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 41]: He interested himself a lot in Mrs. Hillmer 's affairs , looked after some investments for her , and was on very good terms with her , and nobody could whisper a word against the character of either of them .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 9]: He was never there except in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 31]: On very rare occasions he took Mrs. Hillmer , whose maid always accompanied them , to Epping Forest , or up the river , or on some such journey . ''
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 5]: `` Go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 13]: `` I 'm sorry , sir , but the chase is over .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 5]: He 's dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 4]: `` Dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 43]: The maid does n't know how , or when , exactly , but one day she found her mistress crying , and when she asked her what was the matter , Mrs. Hillmer said , ` I 've lost my friend . '
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 13]: The maid said , ` Surely not Colonel Montgomery , madam ? '
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 8]: and she replied , ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 8]: She quite took on about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 16]: `` Had the maid no idea as to the date of this interesting occurrence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 6]: `` Only a vague one .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 8]: Sometime in the autumn or before Christmas .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 33]: By Jove , yes ; it escaped me at the time , but she said that soon after the Colonel 's death another gentleman called and took her mistress out to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 17]: I was so busy thinking about the colonel that I slipped the significance of that statement .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 10]: It must have been you , Mr. Bruce . ''
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 6]: `` So it seems . ''
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 12]: The barrister 's active brain was already assimilating this new information .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 33]: If a woman like Mrs. Hillmer had lost a dear and valuable friend -- one who practically formed the horizon of her life -- she would certainly have worn mourning for him .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 22]: It was a singular coincidence that Mrs. Hillmer `` lost '' Colonel Montgomery about the same time that Lady Dyke disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 15]: Detective and maid alike had drawn a false inference from Mrs. Hillmer 's words .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 16]: `` We must find Colonel Montgomery , '' he said , after a slight pause .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 5]: `` Find him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 24]: `` I hope neither of us is going his way for some time to come , Mr. Bruce , '' laughed the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 13]: `` White , I shall never cure you from jumping at conclusions .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 15]: Upon your present evidence Colonel Montgomery is no more dead than you are . ''
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 17]: `` But the maid said -- '' `` I do n't care if fifty maids said .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 15]: There are many more ways of ` losing ' a friend than by death .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 14]: Pass me the Army List , on that bookshelf behind you there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 16]: A brief reference to the index , and Bruce said : `` I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 8]: There is no _ Colonel _ Montgomery .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 31]: There are several captains and lieutenants , and a Major-General who has commanded a small island in the Pacific for the last five years , but not a single colonel .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 12]: White , you have blundered into eminence in your profession . ''
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 17]: `` I 'm glad to hear it , even as you put it , Mr. Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 14]: But I do n't see -- '' `` I know you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 18]: If you did , a popular novelist would write your life and style you the English Lecocq .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 21]: Mrs. Hillmer ` lost ' the gallant colonel at the same time that the world ` lost ' Lady Dyke .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 20]: Find the first , and I am much mistaken if we do not learn all about the second . ''
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 10]: `` Now I wonder if you are right . ''
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 8]: The detective 's eyes sparkled with animation .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 26]: It was the first real clue he had hit upon , and Bruce 's method of complimenting him on the fact did not disconcert him .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 7]: `` Of course I am right .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 16]: You have done so well with the maid that I leave her in your hands .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 7]: Try the coachman and the cook .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 9]: But keep me informed of your progress . ''
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 5]: White rushed off elated .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 35]: So persistent was he in striving to elucidate this new problem that he paid no heed during some days to the side-light furnished by Jane Harding and her exceedingly curious powers as a letter-writer .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 9]: Bruce purposely left the inquiry to the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 25]: He realized intuitively that the disappearance of Lady Dyke would soon be explained , but he shrank from subjecting Mrs. Hillmer to further questioning .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 16]: His abstinence was rewarded later in the week , for Mensmore came to see him .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 15]: The young man wore an expression of settled melancholy which surprised the barrister greatly .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 15]: `` Have you prevailed on your sister to take us into her confidence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 15]: he said , when Mensmore was ensconced in a chair in his cosy sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 18]: She is more fixed than ever in her resolve to take the whole blame on herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 10]: `` Surely this mistaken idea can be shaken ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 6]: `` I fear not . ''
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 8]: `` And you also share it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 4]: `` I do .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 6]: Bear with us , Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 6]: This is a terrible business .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 8]: It has broken me up utterly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 3]: `` Nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 27]: You are in no way concerned save to shield your sister , and no one credits her wild statements regarding her complicity in this crime . ''
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 24]: `` Look here , my dear fellow , I have come to ask you if this investigation can not be allowed to rest .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 14]: It means a lot of misery that you can not foretell or prevent .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 16]: Knowing what I do , I can not believe that Lady Dyke was murdered . ''
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 14]: `` Knowing what I do , I can not accept any other conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 47]: A worthy and estimable lady leaves her home suddenly , without the slightest imaginary cause , and she is found in the Thames with a piece of iron driven into her brain , while the medical evidence is clear that death was not due to drowning .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 16]: What other inference can be drawn than that she was foully done to death ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 10]: `` Heaven help me , I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 18]: Yet I appeal to you to let matters rest where they are if it is possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 6]: `` It is not possible .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 7]: I can not control the police .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 21]: I am merely a private agent acting on my own responsibility and on behalf of Lady Dyke 's relatives . ''
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 8]: `` Do n't misunderstand me , Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 15]: I am not asking this thing on account of my sister or myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 8]: `` On whose account , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 8]: Mensmore did not answer for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 9]: He looked mournfully into the fire for inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 25]: `` Perhaps I had better tell you , '' he said , `` that I have broken off my engagement with Miss Browne . ''
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 7]: The other jumped from his chair .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 9]: `` What the dickens do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 7]: `` Exactly what I have said .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 27]: When we met on Monday night , I did not mention that Sir William and Lady Browne and their daughter travelled back to England with us .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 6]: On Tuesday I saw Phyllis .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 24]: In view of the shadow thrown on me by this frightful charge I thought it my duty to release her from any ties .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 43]: If my sister has to figure in a court of law as a principal , or accomplice , in a murder case -- and possibly myself with her -- I could not consent to associate my poor Phyllis 's name with mine .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 7]: So I took the plunge . ''
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 11]: `` You are a beastly idiot , '' shouted Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 18]: `` If I had the power I would give you six months ' hard labor this moment .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 14]: Who ever threatened to put you or your sister in the dock ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 13]: `` You have done your best that way , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 3]: `` I ?
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 8]: -- I have shielded you throughout ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 5]: `` I feel that .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 9]: But your admission shows that I am right .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 5]: Shielded us from what ?
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 10]: From arrest by the police , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 8]: `` But why take this precipitate action ?
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 16]: What has Lady Dyke 's death to do with your marriage to Miss Browne ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 7]: `` That 's it , Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 5]: I can not explain .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 6]: I must endure silently . ''
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 13]: `` Did you give her any reason for your absurd resolution ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 9]: I could have no secrets from her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 19]: `` Did you inflict all this wretched story on a woman you loved and hoped to marry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 10]: `` You may be as bitter as you like .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 12]: That is my idea of square dealing , at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 14]: What other pretext could I invite for -- for giving her up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 9]: Mensmore found it hard to utter the words .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 28]: In his heart Bruce pitied him , though he raged at this lamentable issue of the only bright passage in the whole story of death and intrigue .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 9]: `` And what did Miss Browne say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 25]: `` Oh , she just pooh-poohed the affair , and pretended to laugh at me , though she was crying all the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 17]: `` A nice kettle of fish you have made of it , '' growled the barrister .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 30]: `` You help your sister in her folly of silence and then proceed to give effect to it by ruining your own happiness and that of your affianced wife .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 8]: Have you seen Miss Browne since ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 20]: His visitor was so utterly disconsolate that Bruce was at a loss to know how to deal with him .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 29]: He felt that if Mensmore would but speak regarding Mrs. Hillmer 's strange delusion , and the cause of it , all these difficulties and disasters would disappear .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 8]: He resolved to try a direct attack .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 11]: `` Have you ever heard of a Colonel Montgomery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 15]: he said suddenly , bending his searching gaze on the other 's downcast face .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 5]: The effect was electrical .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 10]: Mensmore was so taken back that he was spellbound .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 26]: He looked at Claude , the picture of astonishment , before he stammered : `` I -- you -- who told you about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 19]: `` He was your sister 's friend , adviser , and confidant , '' was the stern reply .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 21]: `` He it is who , in some mysterious way , is bound up with Lady Dyke 's disappearance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 4]: Mensmore rose excitedly .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 14]: `` I can not discuss the matter with you , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 24]: `` I have given my sacred promise , and no matter what the cost may be I will not break my word . ''
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 7]: `` I do not press you .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 8]: But may I see Mrs. Hillmer again ?
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 11]: When she is calmer I might reason with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 42]: The other placed his hand on Bruce 's shoulder , and his voice was very impressive , though shaken by strong emotion : `` Believe me , '' he said , `` it is better that you should not see her .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 5]: It will be useless .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 18]: She is leaving London , not to avoid consequences , but to get away from painful memories .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 21]: Her departure will be quite open , and her place of residence known to any one who cares to inquire .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 7]: One thing she is immovable in .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 17]: She will never reveal to a living soul what she knows of Lady Dyke 's death .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 14]: She would rather suffer any punishment at the hands of the law . ''
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 18]: `` Do n't you understand that this man , Montgomery , is now known to the police .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 21]: Sooner or later he will be found and asked to explain any connection he may have had with the crime .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 19]: Why not accomplish quietly that which will perforce be done through the uncompromising channels of Scotland Yard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 18]: `` Your reasoning appears to be good , but -- '' `` But folly must prevail ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 10]: `` Put it that way if you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 18]: `` So this wretched imbroglio may cost you the love of a charming and devoted girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 12]: `` Heaven help me , it may -- probably will . ''
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 33]: `` I swear to you , '' cried the barrister , who was unusually excited , `` that I will tear the heart out of this mystery before the week expires . ''
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 14]: Mensmore bowed silently and would have left the room , but Smith entered .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 11]: In their distraction they had not heard the bell ring .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 8]: Smith handed a card to his master .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 5]: Instantly Bruce controlled himself .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 15]: His admiration for the dramatic sequence of events overcame his eagerness as an actor .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 24]: It was with an appreciative smile that he said , without the slightest reference to Mensmore : `` Show the lady in . ''
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 21]: Mensmore was passing out , but the sight of the visitor drove him back as though he had been struck .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 5]: It was Phyllis Browne .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 9]: Her recognition of him was a bright smile .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 26]: She advanced to Bruce , saying pleasantly : `` I am glad to meet you , though the manner of my call is somewhat unconventional .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 20]: I heard much of you from Bertie in the Riviera , and more since my return to town . ''
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 9]: He suitably expressed his delight at this apparition .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 18]: Mensmore , not knowing what to do , stood awkwardly at the other end of the room .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 11]: Neither of the others paid the least heed to him .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 24]: `` Of course I had a definite object in coming to see you , Mr. Bruce , '' went on the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 61]: `` I have been coolly told that , because somebody killed somebody else some months ago , a young gentlemen who asked me to be his wife , is not only not going to marry me but intends to spend the rest of his life in Central Africa or China -- anywhere in fact but where I may be . ''
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 11]: `` A most unwise resolve , '' said the barrister .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 5]: `` So I thought .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 29]: You appear to hold the key to the situation ; and , as it is an easy matter to trace you through the Directory , here I am .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 12]: My people think I am skating at St. James 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 29]: `` Well , Miss Browne , '' said Claude , `` I am neither judge nor jury nor counsel for the prosecution , but there is the culprit .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 8]: I hand him over to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 15]: `` Yes ; but that goose did n't kill anybody , did he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 25]: `` And I am sure his sister did not ; from what little I saw of her she would not hurt a fly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 5]: `` Quite true . ''
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 36]: `` Then why do n't you find the man who caused all the mischief -- and -- and -- lock him up at least , so that he can not go on injuring people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 11]: Miss Phyllis was very brave and self-confident at the outset .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 29]: Now she was on the verge of tears , for Mensmore 's saddened face and depressed manner unnerved her more than his passionate words at their last interview .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 30]: `` You ask me a straight question , '' replied Bruce , though his eyes were fixed on Mensmore , `` and I will give you a straight answer .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 12]: I _ will _ find the man who killed Lady Dyke .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 18]: As you say , it is time his capacity for doing injury to others should be limited .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 24]: Before many days have passed Mr. Mensmore will come to you and beg your pardon for his hasty and quite unwarranted resolve . ''
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 9]: `` Do you hear that , Bertie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 4]: cried the girl .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 9]: `` Did n't I tell you so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 10]: Mensmore came forward to her side of the table .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 15]: `` I need not wait , Phil , dear , '' he said simply .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 7]: `` I ask your pardon now .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 9]: This business is in the hands of Providence .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 17]: I was foolish to think that anything I could do would stave off the inevitable . ''
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 20]: `` And if you have -- to go -- to China -- you w-will take me with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 37]: Bruce looked out of the window , whistled , and said loudly , addressing a beautiful lady in short skirts who figured in a poster across the way : `` Let me ring for some tea .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 8]: All this talk makes one dry . ''
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 61]: CHAPTER XXVI LADY HELEN MONTGOMERY 'S SON When the young people had gone -- Mensmore ill at ease , though tremuously happy that Phyllis had so demonstrated her trust in him , Phyllis herself radiantly confident in the barrister 's powers to set everything right -- Bruce devoted himself to the task of determining a new line for his energies .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 6]: The first step was self-evident .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 11]: He must ascertain if the Dykes knew a Colonel Montgomery .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 24]: He drove to the Club frequented by Sir Charles , but the baronet was not there , so he went to Wensley House .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 15]: Sir Charles was at home , in his accustomed nook by the library fire .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 6]: He looked ill and low-spirited .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 14]: The temporary animation he had displayed during the past few weeks was gone .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 17]: If anything , he was more listless than at any time since his wife 's death .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 16]: `` Well , Claude , '' he said wearily , `` anything to report ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 8]: `` Yes , a good deal . ''
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 8]: `` I want to ask you something .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 24]: Did you ever know a Colonel Montgomery , or was your wife acquainted with any one of that name to your knowledge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 8]: `` I do not think she was .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 15]: Had she ever met such a man I should probably have heard of him .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 5]: Who was he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 23]: The baronet 's low state rendered his words careless and indefinite , but his friend did not wish to bother him unduly .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 45]: `` The police have discovered , '' he said , `` that Mrs. Hillmer formed a close intimacy with some one whom she designated by that name and rank , though I have failed to trace any British officer who answers to his description .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 21]: He disappeared , or died , as some people put it , about the same time as your wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 13]: `` Is it not known what became of him , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 9]: `` Wo n't Mrs. Hillmer tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 12]: `` She absolutely refuses to give any help , whatever . ''
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 6]: `` On what ground ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 8]: `` That is best known to herself .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 28]: My theory is that a man she loves is implicated in the affair , and she is prepared to go to any lengths to shield him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 10]: Sir Charles bent over and poked the fire viciously .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 12]: Then he murmured : `` Women are queer creatures , Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 9]: We men never understand them until too late .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 19]: My wife and I did not to all appearance care a jot for one another while she lived .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 32]: Yet I now realize that she loved me , and I would give the little remaining span of existence , dear as life is , to see her once more . ''
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 16]: This was a morbid subject ; the younger man tried to switch him off it .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 21]: `` It is almost clear to me , '' he said , `` that Colonel Montgomery 's name was assumed .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 15]: Few people realize the use of the _ alias _ made in modern life .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 39]: I have a notion that the custom among otherwise honorable people has arisen from the publicity given to the fact that Royal and other distinguished personages frequently choose to conceal their identity under less known territorial titles . ''
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 6]: `` The idea is ingenious .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 8]: We are all slaves to fashion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 26]: `` However that may be , it should not be a difficult task to lay hands on the gentleman should he be still living . ''
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 5]: `` Suppose you succeed .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 12]: How can you connect him with my wife 's death ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 10]: `` At this moment I am unable to say .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 10]: But the cabman might be of some use . ''
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 4]: `` The cabman .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 4]: What cabman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 6]: `` Did I omit that ?
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 34]: I ought to have told you that I have found the driver of the four-wheeler in which your poor wife was taken , dead or insensible , from Sloane Square to Putney . ''
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 7]: `` What an extraordinary thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 5]: `` What is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 16]: `` That you should have forgotten to inform me of such a striking fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 4]: `` Not so .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 12]: Now that I recollect , I have not had the opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 41]: It was impossible to discuss anything else but that forged letter on the last two occasions we met , and it was only a few hours prior to your visit on Monday that I got the cabman 's story fully .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 25]: By the way , do you now see any reason why Jane Harding should have tried to deceive you in such a manner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 29]: The barrister perceived that Sir Charles was nervous and irritable , so he deemed it a needless strain to enlarge on the history of his discovery of Foxey .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 13]: `` I am tired of letters , and plots , and mysteries .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 11]: My life is resolving into one huge note of interrogation .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 12]: Soon the great question of eternity will dominate all others . ''
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 9]: Dyke 's mood unfitted him for sustained conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 27]: Bruce could but pity him , and hope that time would calm his fevered brain , and soothe the unrest that shed this gloom over him .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 37]: `` Really , '' said Claude , after a long interval , during which both men sought inspiration from the dancing flames in the fireplace , `` really this is too bad of you , Dyke .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 29]: You showed a marked improvement for a little space , and now you are letting yourself slip back into a state of lonely and unoccupied moping again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 16]: `` My thoughts find me both occupation and company , '' was the despondent reply .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 20]: `` There is nothing for it , '' continued Bruce cheerfully , `` but a tour round the world .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 5]: You must start immediately .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 22]: A complete change of scene and surroundings will soon pull you back to a normal state of mind and health . ''
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 15]: `` I have been thinking of a long journey for some time past . ''
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 8]: The barrister glanced sharply at his friend .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 11]: The _ double entente _ was not lost on him .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 9]: Dyke was in a depressed and nervous condition .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 46]: The uncertainty regarding his wife 's fate was harassing him unduly and it was with a twinge of conscience that Bruce reflected upon his own eagerness to pursue a quest which , by very reason of its indefiniteness , attracted him as an intellectual pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 27]: `` Look here , '' he cried , on the spur of the moment , `` I have long desired to see the Canadian Pacific route .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 12]: Will you arrange to start West with me a fortnight hence ?
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 10]: We can return when the spirit moves us . ''
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 5]: `` We will see .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 4]: We will see .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 9]: To-day I feel unable to decide anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 22]: `` Yes , I know , but the mere fact that you take the resolution will serve to reanimate you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 16]: `` It is very good of you , Claude , to trouble so about me .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 12]: Had you asked me earlier I might have gone straight away .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 9]: But let it rest for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 27]: When I have recovered my spirits somewhat I will come to you to ask you to sail next day , or something of the sort . ''
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 10]: Beyond this , the other could not move him .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 16]: There was one link in the chain of evidence that would be irrefragable if discovered .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 24]: Was this `` Colonel Montgomery '' in any way connected with the house at Putney where the murderer had disposed of the body ?
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 25]: If this could be established , the unknown visitor to Raleigh Mansions would experience a good deal of difficulty in clearing himself of suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 37]: Bruce was certain that , once the `` Colonel '' was traced , much would come to light explanatory of Mrs. Hillmer 's , and her brother 's , dread lest his identity should be discovered .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 36]: An inquiry addressed to the house agents to whom possible tenants were referred elicited the information that the present owner , a lady , was prepared to let the house annually or on a lease .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 19]: They enclosed an order to view , which Bruce retained in case he should happen to need it .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 22]: A second letter gave him the address of the lady 's solicitors , Messrs. Small & Sharp , Lincoln 's Inn .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 24]: He called on them as a possible tenant , with a desire to purchase the property outright if his proposal could be entertained .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 21]: Mr. Sharp , the partner who dealt with the estate , became very suave when the suggestion reached his ears .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 15]: `` You will understand , Mr. Bruce , that your request requires some consideration .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 44]: The rent my client asks is comparatively low , because the house is old-fashioned , but the splendid riparian position of the property , a free-hold acre on the banks of the Thames at Putney , gives it a highly increased future value .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 41]: Any figure you may have based on a rental calculation would therefore -- '' `` Not meet the case at all , '' said the barrister , repressing a smile at the familiar opening move in the game of bargaining .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 4]: `` Precisely . ''
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 11]: `` May I ask who the present owner is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 10]: `` Certainly , the lady 's name is Small .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 10]: In fact , she is my partner 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 33]: Her father , the late Rev. Septimus Childe , purchased the estate some years ago , largely because the house suited his requirements as the head of a successful private school . ''
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 10]: `` Has the estate changed hands frequently then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 7]: `` Oh , dear , no .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 21]: Indeed , it is well understood that the Rev. Mr. Childe acquired it more as a friendly transaction than otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 44]: The estate is a portion of the separate estate of the late Lady Helen Montgomery , who married Sir William Dyke , father of the present baronet , who perhaps -- good gracious , my dear sir , what is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 10]: Had Bruce been a woman he must have fainted .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 13]: As it was , the shock of the intelligence nearly paralyzed him .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 4]: Sir Charles Dyke !
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 3]: -- Montgomery !
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 11]: -- The house at Putney the property of his mother !
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 10]: What new terror did not this frightful combination suggest ?
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 12]: Why did his friend conceal from him these most important facts ?
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 18]: Why did he pretend ignorance not only of the locality but of his mother 's maiden name ?
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 29]: Like lightning the remembrance flashed through Bruce 's troubled brain that he had only heard of the earlier Lady Dyke as a daughter of the Earl of Tilbury .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 34]: A suspicion -- profoundly horrible , yet convincing -- was slowly mastering him , and every second brought further proof not only of its reasonableness , but of its ghastly and inflexible certainty .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 21]: Again the lawyer 's voice reached his ears , dully and thin , as though it penetrated through a wall .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 7]: `` Surely , you feel ill ?
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 8]: Let me get you some brandy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 10]: `` No -- no , '' murmured the barrister .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 8]: `` It is but a momentary faintness .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 13]: I -- I think I will go out into the fresh air .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 20]: Are you -- quite sure -- that Mr. Childe bought the property from Lady Helen Montgomery 's trustees ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 4]: `` Quite sure .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 15]: If you wait even a few moments I will show you the title-deeds . ''
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 6]: `` No , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 5]: I will call again .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 5]: Pray excuse me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 19]: Somehow Bruce crossed the quiet square of the Inn , and plunged into the turmoil of the street .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 13]: Amid the bustle of Holborn he had a curious sensation of safety .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 18]: The fiend so suddenly installed in his consciousness was less busy here suggesting strange and maddening thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 32]: Why -- why -- why -- fifty questions beat incessantly against the barrier of agonized negation he strove to set up , but the noise of traffic made the attack confused .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 26]: Each incautious bump against a passer-by silenced a demand , each heavy crunch of a ` bus on the gravel-strewed roadway temporarily silenced a doubt .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 14]: He was so unmanned that he felt almost on the verge of tears .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 20]: He absolutely dared not attempt to reason out the fearful alternative which had so fiercely thrust itself upon him .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 13]: At last he became vaguely aware that people were staring at him .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 19]: Fearful lest some acquaintance should recognize and accost him he hailed a hansom and drove to Victoria Street .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 17]: All the way the heavy beat of the horse 's feet served to distract his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 30]: He forced himself to count the quick paces , and tried hard to accommodate the numerals of two or more syllables to the rapidity of the animal 's trot .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 12]: He failed in this , but in the failure found relief .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 37]: Nevertheless , though the horse was willing and the driver eager to oblige a fare who gave a `` good '' address , the time seemed interminable until the cab stopped in front of his door .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 34]: Once arrived there , he slowly ascended the stairs to his own flat , told Smith to pay the cabman half-a-crown and to admit no one , and threw himself into a chair .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 34]: At last he was face to face with the troublous demon who possessed him in Lincoln 's Inn , struggled with him through the crowd , and travelled with him in the hansom .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 12]: Phyllis Browne should have her answer sooner than he had expected .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 11]: The man who murdered Lady Dyke was her own husband .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 6]: `` Oh , heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 20]: moaned Bruce , as he swayed restlessly to and fro in his chair , `` is it possible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 6]: He sat there for hours .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 17]: Smith entered , turned on the lights and suggested tea , but received an impatient dismissal .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 16]: After another long interval Smith appeared again , to announce that Mr. White had called .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 10]: `` Did you not say I was out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 15]: said Claude , his hollow tones and haggard air startling his faithful servitor considerably .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 10]: `` Yes , sir -- oh yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 10]: But that 's no use with Mr. White . '
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 14]: E said as ` ow ' e were sure you were in . ''
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 12]: `` Ask him to oblige me by coming again -- to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 5]: I am very ill .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 8]: I really can not see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 29]: Smith left the room only to return and say : `` Mr. White says , sir , ` is business is of the _ hutmost _ himportance . '
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 26]: E ca n't leave it ; and ' e says you will be very sorry afterwards if you do n't see ` im now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 25]: `` Oh , so be it , '' cried Bruce , turning to a spirit-stand to seek sustenance in a stiff glass of brandy .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 6]: `` Send him in . ''
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 32]: Quite awed by circumstances , Smith admitted the detective and closed the door upon the two men , who stood looking at each other without a word of greeting or explanation .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 11]: CHAPTER XXVII MR. WHITE 'S METHOD The policeman spoke first .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 10]: `` Has Jane Harding been here , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 9]: His words conveyed no meaning to his hearer .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 14]: They were so incongruous , so ridiculously unreasoning , that Bruce laughed hysterically .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 13]: `` You must have seen her , '' cried the detective excitedly .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 25]: `` I know you have learned the truth , and in no other way that I can imagine could it have reached you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 6]: `` Learnt what truth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 16]: `` That Sir Charles Dyke himself is at the bottom of all this business . ''
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 3]: `` Indeed .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 9]: How have you blundered upon that solution ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 15]: `` Mr. Bruce , this time I am right , and you know it .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 10]: It was Sir Charles Dyke who killed his wife .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 17]: Nobody else had anything else to do with it , so far as I can guess .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 17]: But if you have n't seen Jane Harding , I wonder how you found out . ''
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 7]: `` You are speaking in riddles .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 5]: Pray explain yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 35]: `` If Sir Charles Dyke had not been out of town , the riddle would have been answered by this time in the easiest way , as I should have locked him up . ''
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 3]: `` Excellent .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 7]: You remain faithful to tradition . ''
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 19]: `` Mr. Bruce , please do n't try to humbug me , for the sake of your friend .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 6]: I am quite in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 8]: I have come to you for advice .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 8]: Sir Charles Dyke is guilty enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 11]: `` And what do you want me to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 10]: `` To help me to adopt the proper course .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 15]: The whole thing seems so astounding that I can hardly trust my own senses .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 6]: I spoke hastily just now .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 11]: I would not have touched Sir Charles before consulting you .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 13]: I was never in such a mixed-up condition in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 20]: Whatever the source of his information , the detective had evidently arrived at the same conclusion as Bruce himself .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 29]: There was nothing for it but to endeavor to reason out the situation calmly and follow the best method of dealing with it suggested by their joint intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 18]: Claude motioned the detective to a chair , imposed silence by a look , and summoned Smith .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 8]: He was faint from want of food .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 28]: With returning equanimity he resolved first to restore his strength , as he would need all his powers to wrestle with events before he slept that night .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 35]: Mr. White , nothing loth , joined him in a simple meal , and by tacit consent no reference was made to the one engrossing topic in their thoughts until the table was cleared .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 20]: `` And now , Mr. White , '' demanded the barrister , `` what have you found out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 22]: `` During the last two days , '' he replied , `` I have been unsuccessfully trying to trace Colonel Montgomery .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 8]: No matter what I did I failed .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 34]: I got hold of several of Mrs. Hillmer 's tradespeople , but she always paid her bills with her own cheques , and none of them had ever heard of a Colonel Montgomery .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 26]: That furniture business puzzled me a lot -- the change of the drawing-room set from one flat to another on November 7 , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 22]: So I discovered the address of the people who supplied the new articles to Mrs. Hillmer -- '' `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 7]: `` Through the maid , Dobson .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 29]: Mrs. Hillmer has given her notice to leave , and the girl is furious about it , as she appears to have had a very easy place there .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 16]: I think it came to Mrs. Hillmer 's ears that she talked to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 4]: `` I see .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 3]: Proceed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 9]: `` Here I hit upon a slight clue .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 27]: It was a gentleman who ordered the new furniture , and directed the transfer of the articles replaced from No. 61 to No. 12 Raleigh Mansions .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 48]: He did this early in the morning of November 7 , and the foreman in charge of the job remembered that there was some bother about it , as neither Mrs. Hillmer nor Mr. Corbett , as Mensmore used to be called , knew anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 11]: But the gentleman came the same morning and explained matters .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 41]: It struck the foreman as funny that there should be such a fearful hurry about refurnishing a drawing-room , for the gentleman did not care what the cost was so long as the job was carried out at express speed .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 26]: Another odd thing was that Mrs. Hillmer paid for the articles , though she had not ordered them nor did she appear to want them .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 43]: The man was quite sure that Mensmore 's first knowledge of the affair came with the arrival of the first batch of articles from Mrs. Hillmer 's flat , but he could only describe the mysterious agent as being a regular swell .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 26]: He afterwards identified a portrait of Sir Charles Dyke as being exactly like the man he had seen , if not the man himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 17]: `` How did you come to have a portrait of Sir Charles in your possession ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 35]: `` That appears later , '' said the detective , full of professional pride at the undoubtedly smart manner in which he had manipulated his facts once they were placed in order before him .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 23]: `` Of course , '' he went on , `` I jumped at the conclusion that the stranger was this Colonel Montgomery .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 29]: Then , while closely questioning the maid about the events of November 7 , she suddenly remembered that she lost an old skirt and coat about that time .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 17]: They had vanished from her room , and she had never laid eyes on them since .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 5]: This set me thinking .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 36]: I confronted her with the clothes worn by Lady Dyke when she was found in the river , and I 'm jiggered if Dobson did n't recognize them at once as being her missing property .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 10]: Now , was n't that a rum go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 29]: `` It certainly was , '' said Bruce , who was piecing together the story of the murder in his mind as each additional detail came to light .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 10]: `` Naturally I thought harder than ever after that .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 28]: It then occurred to me that Jane Harding must have had some powerful reasons for so suddenly shutting up about the identification of her mistress 's underclothing .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 38]: She was right enough , as we know , in regard to the skirt and coat , but she admitted to me that the linen on the dead body was just the same as Lady Dyke 's .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 42]: Curiously enough , it was not marked by initials , crest , or laundry-mark , and I ascertained months ago that owing to some fad of her ladyship 's , all the family washing was done on the estate in Yorkshire .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 11]: This explained the absence of the otherwise inevitable laundry-mark . ''
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 9]: `` Thus far you are coherence itself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 57]: `` Well , '' said Mr. White complacently , `` I was a long time getting to work , Mr. Bruce , and had it not been for your help I should probably never have got at the truth , but I flatter myself that , once on the right track , I seldom leave it .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 36]: However , as I was saying , I felt that Jane Harding knew a good deal more than she would tell , except under pressure , so I decided to put that pressure on . ''
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 6]: `` In what way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 5]: `` I frightened her .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 16]: Played off on her a bit of the stage business she is so fond of .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 41]: This afternoon I placed a pair of handcuffs in my pocket and went to her place at Bloomsbury , having previously prepared a bogus warrant for her arrest on a charge of complicity in the murder of Lady Dyke . ''
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 8]: `` It was a dangerous game ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 3]: `` Very .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 26]: If it had gone wrong and reached the ears of the Commissioner or got into the papers , I should have been reduced or dismissed .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 11]: But what is a policeman to do in such cases ?
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 23]: I was losing my temper over this infernal inquiry and never obtaining any real light , though always coming across startling developments .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 12]: It had to end somehow , and I took the chance .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 35]: The make-believe warrant and the production of handcuffs for a woman -- they are never used , you know , in reality -- have often been trump-cards for us when everything else failed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 25]: `` This time , then , the ` properties ' made up the ` show , ' as Miss Harding would put it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 8]: `` They did , and no mistake .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 10]: I gave her no time to think or act .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 18]: I found her sitting with her mother , admiring a new carpet she had just laid down .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 37]: I said , ` Is your name Jane Harding , now engaged at the Jollity Theatre , under the alias of Marie le Marchant , but formerly a maid in the service of Lady Dyke ? '
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 21]: She grew very white , and said ` Yes , ' while her mother clutched hold of her , terrified .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 10]: Then I whipped out the warrant and the cuffs .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 15]: My , but you should have heard them squeal when the bracelets clinked together .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 8]: ` What has my child done ? '
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 4]: screamed the mother .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 34]: ` Perhaps nothing , madam , ' I answered ; ` but she is guilty in the eyes of the law just the same if she persists in screening the guilty parties . '
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 19]: Jane Harding was trembling and blubbering , but she said , ` It is very hard on me .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 6]: I have done nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 30]: I trembled myself then , as I feared that she might offer to come with me to the police station , in which case I should have been dished .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 9]: But the mother fixed the affair splendidly . '
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 37]: I am sure my daughter will not conceal anything , ' she said , ` and it is a shame to disgrace her in this way without telling what it is you want to know . '
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 9]: I took the cue in an instant . '
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 32]: I am empowered , ' I said , ` to suspend this warrant , and perhaps do away with it altogether , if she answers my questions fully and truthfully . '
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 25]: ` Why , of course she will , ' said the mother , and the girl , though desperately upset , whimpered her agreement .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 9]: With that I got the whole story . ''
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 12]: `` Sir Charles Dyke inspired her actions , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 7]: `` From the very beginning almost .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 47]: At first Jane Harding herself believed , when she gave evidence at the inquest , that the body she saw was not that of Lady Dyke ; but afterwards she changed her opinion , especially when she recalled the exact pattern and materials of the underclothing .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 9]: Then my inquiries put her on the scent .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 23]: Being rather a sharp girl , she jumped to the conclusion that Sir Charles knew more about the matter than he professed .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 33]: In any case , her place was gone , and she would soon be dismissed , so she resolved on a plan even bolder than mine in threatening to lock her up .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 34]: She watched her opportunity , found Sir Charles alone one day , and told him that from certain things within her knowledge , she thought it her duty to go to the police-station .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 15]: He was startled , she could see , and asked her to explain herself .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 23]: She said that her mistress had been killed , and she might be able to put the police on the right track .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 46]: He hesitated , not knowing what to say ; so she hinted that it would mean a lot of trouble for her , and she would prefer , if she had # 500 , to go to America , and let the matter drop altogether .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 19]: He told her that he did not desire to have Lady Dyke 's name brought into public notoriety .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 16]: Sooner than to allow such a thing to occur he would give her the money .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 11]: An hour later he handed her fifty ten-pound notes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 11]: `` What a wretched mistake , '' cried Bruce involuntarily .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 18]: This unmasking of his unfortunate friend 's duplicity was the most painful feature of all to him .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 22]: `` Perhaps it was , '' replied the detective , `` but the thing is not yet quite clear to me .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 7]: That is why I am here .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 4]: But to continue .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 11]: The girl admitted that she lost her head a bit .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 29]: Instead of leaving the house openly , without attracting comment , she simply bolted , thus giving rise to the second sensational element attending Lady Dyke 's disappearance .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 10]: But she resolved to be faithful to her promise .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 29]: When you found her she held her tongue , and even wrote to Sir Charles to assure him that she had not spoken a word to a soul .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 29]: He sent for her , and pitched into her about not going to America , but took her address in case he wished to see her again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 11]: `` He recognized her letter-writing powers , no doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 3]: `` Evidently .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 19]: She was surprised last Thursday week to receive a telegram asking her to meet him at York Station .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 25]: When she arrived there he asked her to write the letter he handed to you and to post it in London on Saturday evening .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 28]: He explained that his action was due to his keen anxiety to shield his wife 's name , and that this letter would settle the affair altogether .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 30]: As he handed her another bundle of notes , and promised to settle # 100 a year on her for life , she was willing enough to help him .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 19]: During your interview with her you guessed the reason why she wrote Lady Dyke 's hand so perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 9]: She had copied it for three years . ''
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 10]: `` All this must have astonished you considerably ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 10]: `` Mr. Bruce , astonished is n't the word .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 4]: I was flabbergasted !
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 20]: Once she started talking I let her alone , only rattling the handcuffs when she seemed inclined to stop .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 19]: But all the time I felt as if the top of my head had been blown off . ''
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 13]: `` I imagine she had not much more to tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 39]: `` She pitched into you as the cause of all the mischief , and went so far as to say that she was sure it was not Sir Charles who killed Lady Dyke , but you yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 8]: Bruce winced at Jane Harding 's logic .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 23]: Were he able to retrieve the past three months the mystery of Lady Dyke 's death would have remained a mystery forever .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 11]: `` Now about the photograph , '' said the detective .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 40]: `` After I had left Jane Harding with a solemn warning to speak to no one until I saw her again , I made a round of the fashionable photographers and soon obtained an excellent likeness of Sir Charles .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 17]: I showed it to Dobson , and she said : ` That is Colonel Montgomery . '
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 31]: I showed it to the foreman of the furniture warehouse , and he said : ` That is the image of the man who ordered Mrs. Hillmer 's suite . '
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 14]: Now , what on earth is the upshot of this business to be ?
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 16]: I called at Wensley House , but was told Sir Charles was not in town .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 20]: Had he been in , I would not have seen him until I had discussed matters with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 11]: `` That is very good of you , Mr. White .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 12]: May I ask your reason for showing him this consideration ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 32]: The policeman , who was very earnest and very excited , banged his hand on the table as he cried : `` Do n't you see what all this amounts to ?
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 18]: I have no option but to arrest Sir Charles Dyke for the murder of his wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 8]: `` That is a sad conclusion . ''
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 10]: `` And do you believe he killed her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 14]: `` Strange as it may seem to you , I do not . ''
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 11]: `` And I 'm jiggered if I do either . ''
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 13]: `` I -- I am greatly obliged to you , White . ''
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 18]: Claude bent his head almost to his knees , and for some minutes there was complete silence .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 14]: When he again looked at the detective there were tears in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 16]: `` What can we do to unravel this tangled skein without creating untold mischief ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 3]: he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 13]: `` It beats me , sir , '' was the perplexed answer .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 20]: `` But when I came in I imagined that Jane Harding or some one had been to see you .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 14]: Surely , you had learned something of all this before my arrival ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 5]: `` Yes , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 12]: I had reached your goal , but by a different route .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 11]: Unfortunately , my discovery only goes to confirm yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 17]: Bruce then told him of his visit to the lawyer 's office , and its result .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 10]: Mr. White listened to the recital with knitted brows .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 76]: `` It is very clear , '' he said , when the barrister had ended , `` that Lady Dyke was killed in Mrs. Hillmer 's flat , that Sir Charles knew of her death , that he himself conveyed the body to the river bank at Putney , and that ever since he has tried to throw dust in our eyes and prevent any knowledge of the true state of affairs reaching us . ''
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 13]: `` Your summary can not be disputed in the least particular . ''
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 13]: `` Well , Mr. Bruce , we must do _ something _ .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 15]: If you do n't like to interfere , then _ I _ must . ''
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 18]: `` There is but one person in the world who can enlighten us as to the facts .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 10]: That person obviously is Sir Charles Dyke himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 4]: `` Unquestionably . ''
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 6]: Bruce looked at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 5]: It was 10.30 P.M. .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 3]: He rose .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 11]: `` Let us go to him , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 9]: `` But he is not in London . ''
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 4]: `` He is .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 34]: I expect you will find that he gave orders for no one to be admitted , and told the servants to say he had left town to make the denial more emphatic . ''
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 15]: `` It will be a terrible business , I fear , Mr. Bruce . ''
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 11]: `` I dread it -- on my soul I do .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 13]: But I can not shirk this final attempt to save my friend .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 13]: My presence may tend to help forward a final and full explanation .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 13]: No matter what the pain to myself , I must be present .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 8]: Come , it is late already ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 27]: CHAPTER XXVIII SIR CHARLES DYKE 'S JOURNEY The streets were comparatively deserted as they drove quickly up Whitehall and crossed the south side of Trafalgar Square .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 33]: It is a common belief , even among Londoners themselves , that the traffic is dense in the main thoroughfares at all hours of the night until twelve o'clock has long past .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 17]: But to the experienced eye there is a marked hiatus between half-past nine and eleven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 62]: At such a time Charing Cross is negotiable , Piccadilly Circus loses much of its terror , and a hansom may turn out of Regent Street into Oxford Street without the fare being impelled to clutch convulsively at the brass window-slide in a make-believe effort to save the vehicle from being crushed like a walnut shell between two heavy ` buses .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 15]: Such considerations did not appeal to the barrister and his companion on this occasion .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 15]: For some inexplicable cause they both felt that they were in a desperate hurry .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 18]: A momentary stoppage at the turn into Orchard Street caused each man to swear , quite unconsciously .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 19]: Now that the supreme moment in this most painful investigation was at hand they resented the slightest delay .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 24]: Though they were barely fifteen minutes in the cab , it seemed an hour before they alighted at Wensley House , Portman Square .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 10]: In response to an imperative ring a footman appeared .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 34]: Instead of answering the barrister 's question as to whether Sir Charles was at home or not , he said : `` You are Mr. Bruce , sir , are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 16]: `` Sir Charles is at home , but he retired to his room before dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 26]: He is not well , and he may have gone to bed , but he said that if you came you were to be admitted .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 7]: I will ask Mr. Thompson . ''
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 23]: `` Better send Thompson to me , '' said Bruce decisively ; and in a minute the old butler stood before him .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 16]: `` I hear that Sir Charles has retired for the night , '' said Claude .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 12]: Thompson had caught sight of the detective standing on the steps .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 17]: A few hours earlier he had himself told him that the baronet was out of town .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 20]: It was an awkward dilemma , and he coughed doubtingly while he racked his brains for a judicious answer .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 6]: But Bruce grasped his difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 8]: `` It is all right , Thompson .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 7]: Mr. White quite understands the position .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 10]: Do you think Sir Charles is in bed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 9]: `` I will go and see , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 14]: He was very anxious that you should be sent upstairs if you called .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 11]: But that was when he was in the library . ''
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 46]: Bruce and the detective entered the hall , the butler closed the door behind them , and then solemnly ascended the stairs to Sir Charles Dyke 's bedroom , which was situated on the first floor along a corridor towards the back of the house .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 23]: They distinctly heard the polite knock at the door and Thompson 's query , `` Are you asleep , Sir Charles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 19]: After a pause , there was another knock , and the same question in a slightly louder key .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 25]: Then the butler returned , saying as he came down the stairs : `` Sir Charles seems to be sound asleep , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 7]: Bruce and the detective exchanged glances .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 22]: The barrister was disappointed , almost perturbed , but he said : `` In that case we will not disturb him .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 10]: Sir Charles does not often retire so early . ''
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 14]: I have never known him to go to his room so early before .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 14]: He told me not to serve dinner , as he was n't well .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 10]: He would not let me get anything for him .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 15]: He just took some wine , and I have not seen him since . ''
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 5]: `` Since when ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 7]: `` About 7.30 , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 47]: Bruce turned to depart , but Thompson , with the privilege of an old servant when talking to one whom he knew to be on familiar terms with his master , whispered : `` That there blessed maid turned up again this afternoon , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 5]: The barrister started violently .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 8]: `` Not Jane Harding , surely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 17]: She came at four o'clock and asked for Sir Charles , as bold as brass . ''
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 7]: `` Did he see her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 7]: `` Oh yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 9]: `` Do you hear that , White ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 4]: The detective nodded .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 20]: `` She must have reached the house about half-an-hour before me , '' he said , addressing the butler .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 9]: `` That 's about right , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 23]: `` But I understood , '' went on Bruce , `` that Sir Charles was not at home to ordinary callers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 6]: Thompson shuffled about somewhat uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 9]: He wished now he had held his tongue .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 20]: `` I had my orders , sir , '' he murmured , in extenuation of his apparently diverse actions .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 12]: `` Tell me what your orders were , '' persisted Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 29]: The man hesitated , not wishful to offend his master 's friend , but too well trained to reveal the explicit instructions given him by Sir Charles Dyke .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 6]: `` Do not be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 9]: I will explain everything to Sir Charles personally .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 28]: We can not best judge what to do -- whether to wake him or not -- unless we know the position , '' went on the barrister .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 17]: Thus absolved from blame , Thompson took from his waistcoat pocket a folded sheet of notepaper .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 36]: `` I do n't pretend to understand the reason , sir , '' he said , `` but Sir Charles wrote this himself , and told me to be careful to obey him exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 29]: The barrister eagerly grasped the note and read : `` If Mr. Bruce , Jane Harding , or Mrs. Hillmer should call , admit any of them immediately .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 19]: To all others say that I have left town -- some days ago , should they ask you .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 19]: `` C. D. '' White , round-eyed and bullet-headed , gazed with goggle orbs over Bruce 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 12]: `` That settles it , Mr. Bruce , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 9]: `` We _ must _ see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 17]: `` Thompson , '' said Bruce , `` does Sir Charles usually lock his door ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 6]: `` Never , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 9]: Knock again , and then try the door .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 7]: We will go with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 21]: Something in the barrister 's manner rather than his words sent a cold shiver down the old butler 's spine .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 24]: `` I do hope there 's nothing wrong , sir , '' he commenced ; but Bruce was already half-way up the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 9]: Both he and White guessed what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 36]: They knew that poor Thompson 's repeated summons at the bedroom door would remain forever unanswered -- that the unfortunate baronet had quitted the dread certainties of this world for the uncertainties of the next .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 5]: They were not mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 40]: A few minutes later they found him listlessly drooping over the side of the chair in which he was seated , partly undressed , and seemingly overcome at the moment when he was about to take off his boots .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 17]: On a table near him were two bottles , both half-emptied , and an empty wineglass .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 12]: Each of the bottles bore the label of a well-known chemist .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 18]: One was endorsed `` Sleeping-draught , '' the other `` Poison , '' and `` Chloral . ''
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 21]: The three men were pale as the limp , inanimate form in the chair while they silently noted these details .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 18]: Bruce raised the head of his friend in the hope that life might not yet be extinct .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 10]: But Sir Charles Dyke had taken his measures effectually .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 19]: Though the _ rigor mortis _ had not set in , he had evidently been dead some time .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 18]: Thompson , quite beside himself with grief , dropped to his knees by his master 's side .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 5]: `` Sir Charles ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 3]: he wailed .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 4]: `` Sir Charles !
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 10]: For the love of Heaven , speak to us .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 6]: You ca n't be dead .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 6]: Oh , you ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 5]: It ai n't fair .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 7]: You 're too young to die .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 13]: What curse has come upon the house that both should go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 13]: Bruce leaned over and shook the old butler firmly by the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 27]: `` Thompson , '' he said impressively , for now that the crisis he feared had come and gone , he exercised full control over himself .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 20]: `` Thompson , if you ever wished to serve Sir Charles you must do so now by remaining calm .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 16]: For his sake , help us , and do not create an unnecessary scene . ''
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 15]: Governed by the more powerful nature , the affrighted man struggled to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 7]: `` What shall I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 3]: he whimpered .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 9]: `` Shall I send for a doctor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 10]: `` Yes ; say Sir Charles is very ill .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 19]: Not a word to a soul about what has happened until we have carefully examined the room . ''
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 30]: At that instant Mr. White caught sight of a large and bulky envelope , which had fallen to the floor near the chair on which Sir Charles was seated .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 16]: Picking it up , he found it was addressed , `` Claude Bruce , Esq. .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 11]: To be delivered to him _ at once _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 14]: `` This will explain matters , I expect , '' said the detective .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 15]: `` Whatever could have come to my master to do such a thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 9]: groaned Thompson , turning to reach the door .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 9]: `` Come back , '' cried Bruce sharply .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 41]: `` Now , look here , Thompson , '' he went on , placing both his hands on the butler 's shoulders and looking him straight in the eyes , `` it is imperative that you should pull yourself together .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 8]: That sort of remark will never do .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 11]: Sir Charles has simply taken an over-dose of chloral accidentally .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 24]: He has slept badly ever since Lady Dyke 's death , you understand , and has been in the habit of taking sleeping-draughts .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 20]: Now , before you leave the room tell me exactly what has happened , in your own language . ''
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 20]: `` I ca n't put it together now , sir , but I wo n't say anything to anybody .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 7]: You can trust me for that .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 14]: Why , I loved him as my own son , I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 8]: `` Yes , I know that well .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 3]: But remember .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 3]: An over-dose .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 3]: An accident .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 3]: Nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 6]: Do you follow me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 5]: `` Quite , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 6]: Heaven help us all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 14]: Now send for the doctor , without needlessly alarming the other servants . ''
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 25]: Bruce placed the envelope in the pocket of his overcoat , saying to the detective : `` We will examine this later , White .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 13]: Just now we must do what we can to avoid a scandal .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 22]: The case between Lady Dyke and her husband will be settled by a higher tribunal than we had counted upon . ''
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 30]: `` It certainly _ looks _ like an accident , Mr. Bruce , '' was the answer , `` but it all depends upon the view the doctor takes .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 21]: And you know , of course , that I shall have to report the actual facts to my superiors . ''
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 5]: `` That is obvious .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 21]: Yet no harm is done at this early stage in taking such steps as may finally render undue publicity needless .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 44]: It may be impossible ; but on the other hand , until we have heard Sir Charles 's version , contained , I suppose , in this letter to me , it is advisable to sustain the theory of an accidental death . ''
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 17]: `` Anything I can do to help you will be done , '' replied the detective .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 14]: With that they dropped the subject , and more carefully scrutinized the room .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 19]: To all intents and purposes Sir Charles Dyke might , indeed , have brought about the catastrophe inadvertently .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 37]: The sleeping-draught bore the ledger number of its prescription , and there is nothing unusual in a patient striving to help the cautious dose ordered by a physician by the addition of a more powerful nostrum .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 26]: His partly dressed state , too , argued that he had taken the fatal mixture at a time when he contemplated retiring to rest forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 8]: A fire still burned in the grate .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 32]: On the mantelpiece -- in a position where the baronet must see it until the moment when all things faded from his vision -- was a beautiful miniature of his wife .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 11]: The detective , with professional nonchalance , soon sat down .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 23]: There was nothing to do but await the arrival of the doctor , and , having heard his report , go home .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 24]: In the quietude of the room , with the strain relaxed , Bruce was profoundly moved by the spectacle of his dead friend .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 17]: Whatever his logical faculties might argue , he could not regard this man as a murderer .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 34]: If Lady Dyke met her death at his hand then it must have been the result of some terrible mistake -- of some momentary outburst of passion which never contemplated such a sequel .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 19]: Poisons which kill by stupefaction do not distort their victims as in cases where violent irritants are used .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 36]: Sir Charles Dyke seemed to live in a deep sleep , exhausted by toil or pain -- sleep the counterfeit of death -- while the bright colors and speaking eyes of the miniature counterfeited life .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 32]: Standing between these two -- both the mere images of the man and the woman he had known so well -- the barrister insensibly felt that at last they had peace .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 16]: It was his first experience of the tremendous change in the relationship established by death .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 5]: It utterly overpowered him .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 8]: No mere words could express his emotions .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 15]: Between him and those that had been was imposed the impenetrable wall of eternity .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 25]: A bustle in the hall beneath aroused him from his grief-stricken stupor , and Mr. White 's commonplace tones sounded strange to his ears .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 7]: `` Here 's the doctor . ''
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 8]: A well-known physician hastened to the room .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 6]: Thompson had carefully followed instructions .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 19]: The doctor was not prepared for the condition of affairs that a glance revealed to his practised eye .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 8]: `` Surely he is not dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 15]: he cried , looking from the form in the chair to the two men .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 29]: Bruce answered him : `` Yes , for some hours , I fear , but we wanted to avoid spreading unnecessary rumors until -- '' `` I understand .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 4]: My poor friend !
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 7]: How came this to happen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 24]: The skilled practitioner merely lifted one of the dead man 's eyelids , and then turned to examine the bottles on the table .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 17]: `` My own prescription , '' he said , after tasting the contents of one phial .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 15]: `` Ah , this was bad ; why did he not consult me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 16]: and he sadly shook his head as he tasted the remaining liquid in the second .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 9]: `` What do you make of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 3]: said Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 18]: He looked the other steadily in the face and the doctor interpreted the cause of his anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 12]: `` A clear case of accidental poisoning , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 19]: `` Sir Charles has consulted me several times during the past week on account of his extreme insomnia .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 9]: I specifically warned him against overdoing my treatment .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 31]: Change of air , exercise , and diet are the true specifics for sleeplessness , especially when induced , as his was , by a morbid state of mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 21]: `` You mean -- '' `` That Sir Charles has never recovered from the shock of his wife 's death .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 29]: I did not know of it myself until it was announced recently , and I gathered from him that the manner of her demise was partly unaccounted for .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 20]: Altogether , it is a sad business that such a couple should be taken in such a manner . ''
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 19]: Mr. White was industriously taking notes the while , and the doctor regarded him with a questioning look .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 12]: `` This gentleman is in the police , '' explained Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 7]: We came here by mere accident .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 36]: Mr. White and I were engaged in an important inquiry -- the cause of Lady Dyke 's disappearance , in fact -- and we hurried here at a late hour to consult with Sir Charles .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 8]: Hence our presence and this discovery . ''
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 5]: `` How strange ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 23]: `` There is no reason now , '' broke in the detective , `` why the body should not be moved ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 6]: Claude shuddered at the phrase .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 5]: It suggested the inevitable .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 6]: `` Not in the least .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 12]: I am quite satisfied as to the cause of death . ''
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 16]: The despatch of telegrams and other necessary details kept Bruce busily employed until two o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 36]: Not until he reached the privacy of his own library was he able to break the seal of the packet left for him as the final act and word of the late Sir Charles Dyke .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 73]: CHAPTER XXIX HOW LADY DYKE DISAPPEARED -LRB- _ Being the Manuscript left by Sir Charles Dyke , Bart. , and addressed to Claude Bruce , Esq. , Barrister-at-law _ -RRB- It is customary , I believe , for poor wretches who are sentenced to undergo the last punishment of the law to be allowed a three weeks ' respite between the date of their sentence and that on which they are executed .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 10]: I am in the position of such a one .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 23]: The difference between me and the convicted felon lies merely in environment ; in most respects I am worse situated than he .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 53]: My period of agony is longer drawn out , I am condemned to die by my own hand , I am mocked by the surroundings of luxury , taunted by the knowledge that though life and even a sort of happiness are within my reach I must not avail myself of them .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 25]: There may come a time in the affairs of any man when he is compelled to choose between a dishonored existence and voluntary death .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 8]: These unpleasant alternatives are now before me .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 26]: You , who know me , would never doubt which of them I should adopt , nor will you upbraid me because our judgments coincide .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 56]: There is nothing for it , Bruce , but quiet death -- death in the least obtrusive form , and so disposed that it may be possible for you , chief among my friends and the only person I can trust to fulfil my wishes , to arrange that my memory may be speedily forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 32]: My virtues , I fear , will not secure me immortality ; my faults , I hope , will not be spread broadcast to cram the maws of the gaping crowd .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 14]: I do not shirk this final issue , nor do I crave pity .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 29]: In setting forth plainly the history of my wife 's death and its results , I am actuated solely by a desire to protect others from needless suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 17]: Having resolved to pay forfeit for my own errors , I claim to have expiated them .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 10]: This document is an explanation , not a confession .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 23]: I have not much time left wherein fittingly to shape my story so as to be just to all , myself included .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 30]: If I am not mistaken , the officers of the law are in hot chase of me , but my statement shall not be made to an earthly judge .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 21]: The words of a man about to die may not be well chosen ; they should at least be true .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 15]: I will tell of events as nearly as possible in their sequence of time .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 33]: If I leave gaps through haste or forgetfulness you will , from your own knowledge of the facts , readily fill them up once you are in possession of the salient features .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 12]: Mensmore and his sister were the friends of my early years .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 6]: We played together as children .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 23]: Gwendoline Mensmore was two years younger than I , and I well remember making love to her at the age of eleven .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 27]: Her mother died when she was quite a baby , and her father married again , so her step-brother Albert is her junior by four years .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 12]: I taught him how to ride and swim and play cricket .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 34]: My father 's place in Surrey -- we did not acquire the Yorkshire property until the death of my grandfather -- adjoined the estate General Mensmore occupied after his retirement from the army .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 43]: We children always called Gwendoline `` Dick , '' to avoid the difficulty of her long-sounding name , I suppose , and I honestly believe that our respective parents entertained the idea that a marriage between us was quite a natural thing .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 24]: I went to school at Brighton , and Mensmore , being a somewhat precocious lad , joined the same school before I left .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 65]: The headmaster , the Rev. Septimus Childe , was an old friend of my father 's , and when he wished to purchase a house at Putney -- the terrible house which has figured in my dreams for the past three months as a Place of Skulls -- my parents put pressure on my mother 's trustees to make the transaction an easy one .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 8]: Of course , I knew it well .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 20]: We regarded it in those early days as a town house , and always lived there during the season .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 13]: My father 's succession to the title and estates changed all that .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 30]: We quitted Surrey for Yorkshire , and Wensley House , Portman Square , was a step upwards from the barrack-like building which so admirably suited Mr. Childe 's requirements .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 11]: When I was at Sandhurst General Mensmore got into difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 15]: He quitted Surrey , and we gradually lost sight of him and his children .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 39]: Afterwards I knew that he struggled on for a few years , placed his son in the army , and then came a complete collapse , ending in his death and the boy 's resignation of his commission .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 9]: Of Gwendoline Mensmore 's whereabouts I knew nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 16]: Her memory never quitted me , but the new interests in my life dulled it .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 11]: I imagined that I could laugh at a childish infatuation .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 4]: Then I married .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 34]: I did so in obedience to my father 's wishes , and Alice was , I suppose , an ideal wife -- far too ideal for a youngster of my lower intellectual plane .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 13]: I know now that I never had any real affection for her .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 10]: I was always somewhat awed by her loftier aspirations .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 23]: My interests lay in racing , hunting , sports generally , and having what I defined as `` a good time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 50]: She , though an excellent horsewoman , and in every sense an admirable hostess , thought Newmarket vulgar , treated Ascot as a social necessity , and turned up her eyebrows at me when I failed to see any utility in schemes for the reclamation of the submerged tenth .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 12]: Thus , though we never quarrelled , we gradually drifted apart .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 35]: She knew she bored me if she asked me to inspect a model dwelling ; I knew she hated the people who were the companions of a coaching tour or a week at Goodwood .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 9]: Unfortunately , we were not blessed with offspring .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 18]: Had it been otherwise , we might have found a common object of interest in our children .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 9]: Insensibly , we agreed to a separate existence .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 12]: We lived together as friends rather than as husband and wife .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 9]: We parted without regret and met without cordiality .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 7]: Do not think we were unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 13]: If our marriage was not bliss , it was at least comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 39]: I think my wife was proud of my successes on the turf in a quiet kind of way , and I certainly was proud of her and of the high reputation she enjoyed among all classes of society .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 35]: I even reverenced her for it , and I well knew that the enthusiastic receptions given us by our Yorkshire tenantry were not due to my efforts in their behalf , but to hers .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 29]: So we lived for nearly six years , and so we might have continued for sixty had I not met Gwendoline Mensmore again , under vastly changed circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 17]: She was a chorus-girl in a variety theatre , earning a poor living under wretched conditions .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 8]: I discovered the fact by mere chance .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 39]: I met her , and she told me her story -- how she had married a man named Hillmer , whom her father had trusted , and whom she believed to be able to save them from ruin .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 5]: Then the crash came .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 29]: Her father died ; her husband also broke down financially , took to drink and ill-treated her ; her brother was swallowed up somewhere in the Far West .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 33]: She had no alternative but to live apart from her husband and try to support herself by the first career that suggests itself to a young , talented , and beautiful woman .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 13]: But she was already weary of the stage and its distasteful surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 13]: Her nature was too delicate for the rude friendships of the dressing-room .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 21]: She shuddered at the thought of a mild carousal in a bar when the labors of the night were ended .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 33]: In a word , were I differently constituted , were she cast in more common mould , there was apparently ready to hand all the material for a vulgar _ liaison _ .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 24]: My respect for my wife , however , no less than Mrs. Hillmer 's fine disposition , saved both of us from folly .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 21]: Yet I could not leave her exposed to the exigencies of a life in which she was rapidly becoming disillusioned .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 25]: Away in the depths of my heart I knew that this sweet woman was my true mate , separated from me by adverse chance .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 10]: There was nothing unfair to Alice in the thought .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 33]: Were she questioned at any time , I suppose , she must have admitted that we were , in some respects , as ill-matched a couple as we were well-matched in others .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 20]: You will say that I understood but little of feminine nature -- nothing at all of my wife 's .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 12]: How best to help Mrs. Hillmer -- that was the question .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 25]: It was at this stage I made the initial mistake to which I can , too late , trace a host of succeeding misfortunes .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 7]: I did not consult my wife .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 55]: Trying now to analyze my reasons for this lamentable error of judgment I imagined that it arose from some absurd disinclination on my part to admit that I went to the stage-door of a theatre to inquire about the identity of a young woman whom I had recognized from the front of the house .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 23]: Do n't you see , my dear Bruce , it is almost as bad to fear your wife as to suspect her .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 47]: As , at that time , my own life was free from the slightest cloud of sorrow , I took keen interest in the troubles of Mrs. Hillmer , and I amused myself by playing , in her behalf , the part of a modern magician .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 42]: I felt intuitively that she would resent any direct attempt on my part to place funds at her disposal , and I found a great deal of harmless fun in helping her with her consent , but without her actual knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 11]: I am , as you know , a rich man .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 16]: At this hour I can not sum up my available assets to within # 100,000 .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 27]: Altogether I must be worth nearly a million sterling -- yet my money can not purchase me another day 's existence such as I would tolerate .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 6]: Strange , is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 60]: Well , the close of the year before last was a period of unexampled activity on the Stock Exchange , and , by way of a joke , I made some purchases on Mrs. Hillmer 's account , with the intention of pretending to pay myself out of the profits , while handing her such balances as might accrue .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 22]: She is a shrewd woman , and quick at figures , so I might have experienced some difficulty in deceiving her .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 18]: But the mad record of the past twelve months was in no wise belied by its inception .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 14]: My purchases were those of a man inspired by the Goddess of Fortune .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 9]: Stocks which I bought commenced suddenly to inflate .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 38]: I astounded my brokers by the manner in which I ferreted out neglected bonds , mines which struck the mother lode next week , railway companies whose directors were even then secretly conspiring to water the stock .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 10]: Mrs. Hillmer became infected with the craze like myself .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 12]: Twice we plunged heavily in American Rails and came out triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 56]: To end this part of my story , after five months of excitement I had contrived not only to swell my own deposits to a large extent , but I had secured on Mrs. Hillmer 's account a sufficient quantity of reliable stock to bring her in an average income of # 1,500 per annum .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 21]: My greatest difficulty was to persuade Mrs. Hillmer to break off the habit of speculation once she had contracted it .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 30]: I found that she perused the late editions of the evening papers with the same eagerness that a bookmaker looks for the starting prices of the day 's races .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 17]: By the exercise of firmness and tact I was able to stop her from further dealings .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 16]: At the close of this period I need hardly say that two things had happened .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 31]: Mrs. Hillmer and I were fast friends , with common objects and interests in life ; and , concurrently , the ties between Alice and myself had loosened still more .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 7]: I also carelessly made another blunder .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 28]: Under the pretence that secrecy was requisite for Stock Exchange transactions , I persuaded Mrs. Hillmer to allow me to pass under the name of Colonel Montgomery .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 15]: Mrs. Hillmer , of course , was now able to live in comparative luxury .
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 12]: I came to regard her house as an abode of rest .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 14]: I was more at home in her drawing-room than in my own house .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 24]: She often spoke to me of my wife , and obviously wished to see her , but here I did a cowardly thing .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 24]: I represented my married existence as far less comfortable than it really was , and gradually Mrs. Hillmer ceased all allusion to Alice .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 5]: She misunderstood our relations .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 9]: I knew it , and did not explain .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 22]: Not a very worthy proceeding for a man whose sense of honor is so keen that he prefers death to disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 11]: But one can deceive no other so easily as oneself .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 11]: Occasionally , when opportunities offered , we went out together .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 14]: It was foolish , you will say , and I agree with you .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 12]: If folly were not pleasant it would not be so fashionable .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 17]: But , to this hour , the relations between us are those only of close friendship .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 28]: Never in my life have I addressed her by other than her married name , never have I touched her arm save by way of casual politeness .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 11]: I really think I flattered myself upon my superior virtues .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 15]: I could see all the excellence but none of the stupidity of my behavior .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 10]: About this time , Mrs. Hillmer 's husband died .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 8]: Thenceforth she became slightly reserved in manner .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 15]: When life was a defiance she fought convention , but with safety came prudence .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 22]: In fact , she told me that my frequent visits to her house would certainly be ill-construed if they became known .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 22]: I was seeking for a pretext to introduce her to her own set in society , when a double catastrophe occurred .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 26]: My wife discovered , as she imagined , that I was clandestinely occupied with another woman , and Mrs. Hillmer 's brother returned from America .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 28]: It will best serve my hurried narrative if I relate events exactly as they happened , and not as they look in the light of subsequent knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 27]: Mensmore was naturally astounded to find his sister so well provided for , and gratefully accepted the help she gave him towards resuscitating his own fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 49]: But it did not occur to either of us that he would take the ordinary view of the bond existing between us , and I shall never forget his rage when he found out that I was not known to his sister 's servants by my right name .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 9]: It was an awkward position for all three .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 16]: He was loth to allege that which we did not feel called upon to deny .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 40]: But between him and me there was a marked coolness , arising from suspicion on his part and resentment on mine , coupled , I must add , with an unquiet consciousness that his attitude was not wholly unreasonable .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 10]: Mrs. Hillmer and he discussed the matter several times .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 10]: He urged that this compromising friendship should be discontinued .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 42]: She -- a determined woman when her mind was made up -- fought the suggestion on the ground of unfairness , though , like myself , she would have been glad of any accident which would alter the position of affairs .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 8]: He interpreted her opposition to different motives .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 43]: Finally , as his financial position was a dangerous one , as we afterwards learned , and he despaired of setting things straight in Raleigh Mansions -- judging them from his own point of view -- he resolved to leave England again .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 11]: And now I come to the night of November 6 .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 14]: It was , as you will remember , a foggy and unpleasant day .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 15]: I had some business in the city which detained me until darkness set in .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 35]: I had not seen Mrs. Hillmer for two days , so I resolved to drive to Sloane Square -- travelling by the Underground was intolerable in such weather -- and have tea with her .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 21]: I did not know then that she had gone with her maid to Brighton -- intending to return that evening .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 24]: It was a sudden whim , she told me subsequently , and she had not even informed the other servants of her intention .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 34]: The pavements in the City were slimy with the dampness of the fog , and as an empty four-wheeler passed through Cornhill I hailed it , a most unusual choice on my part .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 34]: The cabman , I noticed , was fairly elevated , but as these fellows often drive better when drunk than sober , I simply told him to be careful , and jumped in .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 21]: I reached Sloane Square all right , and detained the cab for my intended journey home in time for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 37]: At the door of Mrs. Hillmer 's flat I met the cook and housemaid , both going out to do some shopping , probably , in the spare hour before it was time to prepare dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 30]: They knew me well , of course , and admitted me to the drawing-room , telling me that Mrs. Hillmer was out , but would surely return very soon .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 56]: I had not been in the room a minute before the sharp double knock of a telegraph messenger brought the coachman , whom the girls left in charge of the house , to the door , and I startled the man by appearing in the hall , as he did not know of my presence .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 8]: `` What is it , Simmonds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 15]: I said , as I correctly guessed the message to be from Mrs. Hillmer .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 13]: `` The missus is in Brighton , sir , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 14]: `` She wants the carriage to meet her at Victoria at seven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 26]: It 's six now , and I ought to go around to the stables at once , but both these blessed girls have gone out .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 8]: I 'm in a fair fix . ''
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 10]: `` No fix at all , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 30]: `` I want to see Mrs. Hillmer , so I will wait here until she arrives -- or , at all events , till the servants come back . ''
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 43]: The man scratched his head , but he could think of no better plan , so he , too , went off , and I was left alone , for the first time in my life , in Mrs. Hillmer 's abode .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 19]: It is the small events that govern our lives , Claude , not those that stand out prominently .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 51]: The shopping expedition of a couple of servant girls , intent on securing a new cap or a few yards of calico , brought about my wife 's death , caused misery to many people , and ends , I sincerely hope , in my own speedy leap into oblivion .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 51]: I picked up a novel , `` Tess of the D'Urbervilles , '' hit upon the terrible episode that culminates on Salisbury Plain , and was soon deeply interested , when another knock -- this time an imperative summons long drawn out -- caused me to hasten to the door .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 26]: I opened it , and in the dim light of the staircase landing , for a second did not recognize the lady who stood outside .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 9]: Heaven help me , I was soon enlightened .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 30]: My wife 's voice was bitterly contemptuous as she said : `` You do n't keep a footman , it appears , in your new establishment , Charles . ''
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 24]: Had I been suddenly struck blind , or paralyzed , I could not have been more dumfounded than by Alice 's unexpected appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 16]: A thorough scoundrel might , perhaps , have thought of the best thing to say .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 6]: I blurted out the worst .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 10]: `` What are you doing _ here _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 9]: I stammered when my tongue recovered its use .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 35]: `` No doubt you resent my appearance , '' she cried , in a high , shrill tone I had never before heard from her , `` but I shall not trouble you further .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 16]: I merely came to confirm with my own eyes what my ears refused to entertain .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 7]: Now , I am satisfied . ''
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 42]: She half turned with the intention of reaching the street , but , rendered desperate by the absurdity of my position , I gripped her arm and pulled her forcibly into the entrance-hall , closing and bolting the door behind us .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 15]: `` You have seen too much not to see more , '' I cried .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 17]: `` I will not allow you to ruin both our lives by a mere suspicion . ''
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 36]: She was in a furious temper , but her sense of propriety -- for she did not know that the servants ' quarters were empty -- restrained her until we had both entered the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 11]: Then she burst upon me with a torrent of words .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 16]: CHAPTER XXX SIR CHARLES DYKE ENDS HIS NARRATIVE `` A mere suspicion , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 42]: she said , and there was that in her voice which warned me that I had better try unarmed to control a tigress than a wife who deemed herself wronged ; `` these are pretty _ suspicions _ that surround you .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 12]: A house tenanted by another woman where you are evidently master !
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 25]: A mistress who left the ranks of the ballet , or something of the sort , living in luxury on means supplied by you !
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 20]: A married woman who casts off her husband with her poverty , to take up a paramour and riches !
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 10]: Do you think you can blind my eyes further ?
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 10]: I have the most convincing proofs of your infamy .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 14]: Do not imagine that on any specious pretext I will condone your conduct .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 10]: I despise you from the depths of my heart .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 11]: Henceforth I will strive to forget your very existence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 33]: `` Alice , '' I said , and if she had not been blinded by passion she must have been affected by my earnestness , `` will you listen to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 5]: `` Why should I ?
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 19]: What respect have you shown to me that I should now seem even to accept your excuses ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 12]: `` I appeal to you not to do anything in anger .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 10]: You have good reason to be enraged with me .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 10]: I only ask you to suspend your final judgment .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 28]: Hear what I have to say , take time for deliberation , for further inquiry , and then condemn me to any punishment you think fit . ''
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 6]: She did not answer me .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 21]: Her eyes were roving round the room and taking stock of every indication of poor Mrs. Hillmer 's artistic aptitude .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 28]: The place was eminently home-like , much more so than our elegant mansion in Portman Square , and my wife noted the fact with momentarily increasing bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 17]: Yet I essayed my desperate task with failing nerve and terrible consciousness of a bad cause .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 27]: `` Notwithstanding all that you have seen and heard , '' I said , `` I am not guilty of the crime you accuse me of .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 26]: Mrs. Hillmer is an old friend of mine , whom I have helped from a state of misery to one of comfort and comparative happiness .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 17]: She is as pure-minded in thought , as spotless in character , as you are yourself .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 16]: You are doing her a grievous injustice by doubting the relations between her and me .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 12]: If you only knew her -- '' My wife laughed scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 7]: `` Pray spare yourself , Charles .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 17]: I have never seen you so interested before , but you lie badly , nevertheless . ''
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 6]: `` I do not lie .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 10]: Before heaven I am telling you the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 15]: `` You are even willing to perjure yourself , _ Colonel Montgomery _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 9]: My poor armor was ill-fitted for this stroke .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 22]: I suppose I must have flinched before it , for she went on : `` You see I am well posted .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 8]: My detectives have done their work well .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 18]: Oh , Heaven , that I should ever have learned to love a vile wretch like you .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 9]: I thought you respected me , at least .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 21]: I tried hard to bend my own wishes to sympathy with yours , and I dreamt even of ultimate success .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 28]: I knew you did n't care much for me , but the devotion of a slave has at times been rewarded by the affection of her master .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 9]: Fortunately , I am a slave by choice .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 17]: It only required experience to break my bonds , and you have supplied the experience . ''
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 34]: For the first time in my life did it dawn on me that my self-contained and haughty wife harbored other thoughts than a sentiment of respect for an indulgent and easily controlled husband .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 15]: It was a shock to me , a deeper humiliation than she dreamed of .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 36]: How could I expiate the past , wipe out this record of error and folly , but not of ill-doing , and live happily with her so long as Providence was pleased to spare us ?
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 13]: While these things ran through my brain she suddenly turned on me .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 9]: `` You fear exposure in the law courts !
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 10]: You dread your name figuring in a society scandal !
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 6]: How little you know me .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 10]: You naturally compare me by your own contemptible standard .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 31]: I left your house to-night determined never to return to it should I find you here , as in all probability , I was told , would be the case .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 15]: I will go to my sister until I have determined upon my future life .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 19]: You , at least , will never , by my desire , see or hear from me again .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 15]: Thus far , I presume , I will fall in with your views . ''
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 17]: She would have passed me , but I held fast to the inside of the door .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 19]: If once she got away from me I might never be able to set affairs even tolerably right .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 42]: Better , I deemed , have one trying scene in the hope that she would calm down in the face of facts , than allow her to carry the quarrel to her relatives and strengthen her attitude by their natural support .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 14]: `` Alice , '' I said , `` you shall not go . ''
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 10]: `` How can you dare to detain me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 17]: she shrieked , and the glint in her eyes showed how thoroughly her passions were aroused .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 10]: `` You can separate from me if you will .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 8]: I shall not venture to hinder you .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 13]: But I swear you shall not do this rash act without knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 8]: I tell you you must remain here .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 13]: When you leave this house you do so in my company . ''
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 12]: `` And why am I to be kept a prisoner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 11]: `` Mrs. Hillmer will return in less than an hour .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 7]: You have sought this meeting yourself .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 5]: You shall have it .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 51]: When your charges have been thoroughly thrashed out in the presence of Mrs. Hillmer and myself I will then accompany you where you will , and leave you under the protection of your sister , or any one else you choose , should you still persist in leaving me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 11]: Of course my action was unwise to the last degree .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 29]: But remember , Claude , that during these last awful five minutes I had seen a side of my wife 's nature hidden from me six long years .
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 19]: And I was a man suddenly plunged into a raging sea , drifting helplessly I knew not whither .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 16]: All that consumed me was a wild desire for such scant justice as I deserved .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 16]: I had erred , but my faults were not those my wife alleged against me .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 11]: If she was angry before she was now absolutely uncontrollable .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 3]: she screamed .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 9]: `` Remain to meet your -- your mistress ?
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 8]: Never , while I have life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 16]: She flung herself upon me so suddenly that she tore me away from the door .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 40]: She was a strong and athletic woman , and I suppose she expected some resistance , for she used such force as to drag me forward into the middle of the room , overturning a chair in the effort .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 19]: I was so utterly taken by surprise that I yielded to her violence more completely than she expected .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 19]: She staggered , let go her hold , and fell heavily backwards , tripping over the fallen chair .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 28]: I made a desperate attempt to save her , but only caught the end of a fur necklet , and it tore like a spider 's web .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 32]: Her body crashed against a Venetian fender , and her head came with awful force against a sort of support for the fire-irons that stood up a foot from the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 24]: Then she rolled over , her eyes and face undergoing a ghastly change , and instantly became , as I thought , unconscious .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 32]: I knelt beside her , raising her head with my right hand , and brokenly besought her to speak to me , when I would at once do anything she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 8]: But she gave no sign of animation .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 42]: In a frenzy of despair , I forced myself to examine her injuries , and my heart nearly stopped beating when I discovered that a large piece of iron had been driven into her brain through the back of her head .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 10]: I knew in a moment that she was dead .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 74]: Although I have not had much experience of that terrible epoch in the human being , I have seen far too much of death in animal life not to know that she who had been my honored and respected wife now lay before me a mere soulless entity -- a symbol only of the splendid vital creature who , a minute earlier , was angrily protesting against the supposed faithlessness of her mate .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 40]: Looking back now upon the events of that fateful night , I marvel at the appalling coolness which came to my aid as soon as I realized the extent of the misfortune which had befallen both Alice and myself .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 28]: I can fully understand what is meant by the callousness of a certain class of criminals , or the indifference to inevitable death betrayed by Eastern races .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 34]: No sooner was I quite assured that my wife was dead -- dead beyond hope or doubt -- than I regained the use of my reasoning faculties in the most marvellously cold-blooded degree .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 9]: The actual difficulties of my position were enormous .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 39]: I arraigned myself before the judge and jury , and saw clearly that every circumstance which contributed to Alice 's suspicions in the first instance were now magnified a hundred-fold by the manner and scene of her death .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 65]: Before me , in ghostly panorama , moved the dread crowd of witnesses against me , the degradation of my family , the bitter and vengeful feelings of my wife 's relatives , the suffering of poor , unconscious Mrs. Hillmer , the whole avalanche of horror and misery which this unfortunate accident had precipitated upon every person who claimed my relationship or friendship .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 7]: My mental attitude was quite altruistic .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 19]: Could I have undone the past , I would cheerfully have undergone a painful and protracted death forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 13]: But no possible atonement on my part would restore Alice to life .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 25]: I knew it was quite improbable that I should be convicted of murdering her , strong as the circumstantial testimony against me must be .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 16]: The mere legal consequences did not , however , weigh with me for a second .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 12]: From that awful hour I felt that I was doomed personally .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 23]: My only thought was to seek oblivion , not only for myself , but for all whom Alice 's death might affect .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 24]: Reasoning in this way , I rapidly resolved to make a bold effort to conceal forever the time and place of the fatality .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 30]: If I failed , I could tell the truth ; if I succeeded , I might , at my own expense , save a vast amount of unnecessary sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 39]: The desperate expedient came to me of carrying off the body to the untenanted house at Putney where my old master had resided until his death , utilizing the four-wheeled cab with its half-drunken driver for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 34]: If I reached Putney unhindered , I could dispose of my terrible burden easily , for the river flowed past the grounds , and every inch of the locality was known to me .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 14]: It occurred to me that perhaps the body might be found and recognized .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 45]: Our personal linen was never marked , by reason of the fact that our laundry work was done upon our Yorkshire estate , but as a temporary safeguard I resolved to take some different and less valuable outer clothes from Mrs. Hillmer 's residence .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 39]: Her maid was of a similar build to my wife , so I hastened to the girl 's room , and laid hands upon a soiled coat and skirt which were relegated to the recesses of the wardrobe .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 12]: I glanced at my watch as I came along the corridor .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 21]: It was 6.15 P.M. All the incidents I have related to you had happened within a quarter of an hour .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 4]: Oh , heaven !
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 12]: it seemed longer than all the preceding years of my life .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 29]: Having resolved upon a line of conduct , I pursued it with the _ sang-froid _ and accuracy of one of the superior scoundrels delineated by Du Boisgobey .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 8]: The door of the flat was locked .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 28]: If the servants , hardly due yet , returned unexpectedly , I would send them off to Victoria Station on some imaginary errand of their mistress 's .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 28]: I knelt beside my poor wife 's body once more , and with great difficulty took off her costume and loosely fastened on the maid 's garments .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 38]: In her purse there were some bulky documents , which I afterwards discovered to be the reports furnished by a firm of private detectives , detailing all my movements with reference to Raleigh Mansions with surprising accuracy .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 7]: But she had concealed her name .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 12]: These men themselves only knew me as `` Colonel Montgomery . ''
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 12]: How Alice first came to suspect me I can only guess .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 47]: Perhaps my indifference , my absence from home at definite hours , a chance meeting in the street unknown to me -- any of these may have supplied the initial cause , and led her to verify her doubts before taxing me with my supposed iniquity .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 22]: Indeed , her final act in coming alone to Mrs. Hillmer 's abode , revealed her fearless spirit and independent methods .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 7]: She wanted no divorce court revelations .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 13]: She would simply have spurned me as an unworthy and dishonorable wretch .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 23]: Her small belongings I put in my pockets ; the clothes I made into a parcel and stuffed temporarily beneath my overcoat .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 17]: Then I unlocked the door , and went down the few steps to the main entrance .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 22]: There was no one about , the fog and sleet having cleared the street -- a quiet thoroughfare at all times .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 20]: I took the risk of the maids coming back , and I ran to the square for my conveyance .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 15]: The driver had been improving the occasion , and was more inebriated than before .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 27]: He brought his cab to the door , and I knew , by the appearance of things , that no one had entered during my absence .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 34]: With some difficulty I lifted Alice 's body into my arms in as natural a position as possible , and carried her to the cab , leaving the door of the flat ajar .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 5]: Luck still favored me .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 12]: The cabman supposed that she , like himself , was intoxicated .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 34]: A man came down the opposite side of the street , but he paid not the slightest heed to me , and , indeed , we were but dimly visible to each other .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 23]: Exerting all my strength unobtrusively , I placed my wife on the rear seat , and then calmly gave the driver instructions .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 16]: He grumbled at the distance , but I told him I would pay him handsomely .
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 40]: Searching in my pockets and Alice 's purse , I could only find twelve shillings , so , although it was risky , to avoid a quarrel with the man , I determined to give him a five-pound note .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 8]: Thus far , all had gone well .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 41]: The notion possessed me that , to all intents and purposes , I had murdered my wife , and that I was now disposing of the visible signs of my guilt in the most approved manner of a daring criminal .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 18]: Whether I did right or wrong I can not , even at this late hour , decide .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 19]: Should my death induce forgetfulness , I am still inclined to think that I acted for the best .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 9]: My wife was dead ; I was self-condemned .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 17]: Why , then , allow others , wholly innocent , to be dragged into the vortex ?
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 7]: This was my line of thought .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 32]: If you , reading this ghastly narrative , shudder at my deeds , I pray you nevertheless to weigh in the balance the good and ill that resulted from my actions .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 29]: At last we reached Putney , and drew up at the end of the disused lane which runs down by the side of the house to the river .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 9]: Here , again , the road was deserted .
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 21]: I lifted my wife out , carried her to the postern-gate , and returned to give the driver his note .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 24]: The man was so amazed at the amount that he whipped up his horse instantly , fearing lest I should change my mind .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 47]: I was about to force open the old and rickety door into the garden when I remembered the drain-pipe jutting into the Thames -- a place where , as a child , I often caused much alarm by surreptitious visits for the purpose of catching minnows .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 24]: I quickly took off my coat and boots , turned up my trousers and shirt-sleeves , and examined the pipe with my hands .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 6]: It exactly suited my purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 15]: In half a minute I had firmly wedged my wife 's body beneath it .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 10]: This was the most horrible portion of my task .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 38]: The chill water , the desolation of the river bank , the mud and trailing weeds -- all these things seemed so vile and loathsome when placed in contact with the mortal remains of my ill-fated Alice .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 5]: She had loved me .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 34]: I believe I loved her , as I assuredly do now when her presence is but a memory , yet I was condemned to commit her to the contaminating beastliness of such surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 31]: It was a small matter , in the face of death , but it has weighed on me since more than any other feature of that cruel night 's history .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 26]: Before leaving Putney I tied her clothes , hat , and furs to a couple of heavy stones and threw the parcel into deep water .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 15]: By train and cab I reached home but a few minutes late for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 26]: It was not difficult for me to act my part with the servants , nor keep up the farce during the weary days that followed .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 24]: My consciousness was so seared by what I had gone through that the mere make-believe of my position was a relief to me .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 38]: That night , in the privacy of my room , I recollected the broken fender , and feared lest the ironwork would supply a clue should the body be discovered , a thing I deemed practically impossible .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 13]: But , for Mrs. Hillmer 's sake , I took no risk .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 41]: Next morning , before I saw you at Tattersall 's , I made arrangements for the whole contents of her drawing-room to be transferred to her brother 's flat , where , to my knowledge , the articles were needed .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 16]: Mrs. Hillmer had gone out early , so the thing was done in her absence .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 45]: Her amazement was so great that she wired me , using as a signature the pet name of her childhood , and this was the first message you heard the groom refer to when he came a second time with the telegram from Richmond .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 55]: I wrote her a hurried note , explaining that I intended the transfer as a sop to her offended brother , but she had telegraphed again , and I had to go to see her , to learn that Mensmore resented the gift , and had gone off in a huff to Monte Carlo .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 15]: A little later , I took the supreme step of writing a farewell letter .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 15]: Since my wife 's death I could not bear to meet any other woman .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 13]: I communed with my poor Alice more when dead than when alive .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 12]: I do not think I have anything else to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 16]: Step by step I watched you and the police tearing aside my barrier of deceit .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 12]: At times I thought I would baffle you in the end .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 17]: Were it not for my folly in bribing Jane Harding I think I must have succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 43]: That poor girl was the undoing of me in the first instance , and she now has brought me my final sentence , for she came to-day and told me , with tears , all that happened between the detective and herself .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 9]: White , too , put in an appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 24]: To-morrow , I suppose , he will bring a warrant , if you do not see him first and tell him the truth .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 5]: Do not misunderstand me .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 7]: I am glad of this release .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 41]: When you strove to arouse me from my despair I did , for a little while , cherish the hope that I might be able to devote my declining years to the work which Alice herself took an interest in .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 57]: But the web of testimony woven round my old friend , Mensmore ; the self-effacing spirit of his sister , who , to shield me , was willing to sacrifice herself ; the possibility that I might involve these two , and perhaps others , in my own ruin -- every circumstance conspired to overwhelm me .
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 10]: I can endure no more , my dear Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 4]: It is ended .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 13]: The past is already a dream to me -- the future void .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 12]: My poor nature was not designed to withstand such a strain .
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 21]: The cord of existence has snapped , and I can not bring myself to believe it will be mended again .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 9]: In bidding you farewell I ask one thing .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 38]: If you take a charitable view of my deeds , if you consider that my penalty is commensurate with my faults , then you might take my dead hand and say , `` This was my friend .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 4]: I pity him .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 21]: May the spirit of his wife be merciful unto him should they meet in the regions beyond the grave . ''
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 14]: And so , for the last time , I sign myself CHARLES DYKE .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 28]: CHAPTER XXXI VALEDICTORY Much as Bruce would have wished to inter his dead friend 's secret with his mortal remains in the tomb , it was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 43]: Sir Charles Dyke 's sacrifice must not be made in vain , and the strange chain of events encircled other actors in the drama too strongly to enable the barrister to adopt the course which would otherwise have commended itself to him .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 33]: An early visit to Scotland Yard , where , in company with Mr. White , he interviewed the Deputy Commissioner , and a conference with the district coroner settled two important questions .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 38]: The police were satisfied as to the cause of Lady Dyke 's death , and the coroner agreed to keep the evidence as to the baronet 's sudden collapse strictly within the limits of the medical evidence .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 9]: A wholly unnecessary public scandal was thus avoided .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 11]: With Lady Dyke 's relatives his task required considerable tact .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 41]: Without taking them fully into his confidence , he explained that Sir Charles had all along known the exact facts bearing upon her death and burial-place , but for family reasons he thought it best not to disclose his knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 20]: Bruce needed their co-operation in getting the home office to give the requisite permission for Lady Dyke 's reburial .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 48]: The circumstance that the deceased baronet had left his estates to his wife 's nephew , joined to the important position Bruce occupied as one of the trustees and joint guardian , with the boy 's mother , of the young heir , smoothed over many difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 31]: After a harassing and anxious week Bruce had the melancholy satisfaction of seeing the remains of the unfortunate couple laid to rest in the stately gloom of the family vault .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 22]: The newspapers , of course , scented a mystery in the proceedings , but definite inquiry was barred in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 30]: Even the exhumation order gave no clue to the reasons of the authorities for granting it , and in less than the proverbial nine days the incident was forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 58]: Sir Charles had made it a condition precedent to the succession that his heir should bear his name , and should live with his widowed mother on the Yorkshire estate , or in the town house , for a certain number of months in each year , until the boy was old enough to go to school .
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 18]: The stipulation was intended to have the effect of more rapidly burying his own memory in oblivion .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 24]: Bruce , too , was given a sum of # 5,000 , `` to be expended in bequests as he thought fit . ''
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 6]: Claude understood his motive thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 29]: Jane Harding had been loyal to her master in her way , so he arranged that she should receive an annual income sufficient to secure her from want .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 36]: Thompson , too , was provided for when the time came that he was too feeble for further employment at Portman Square , and Mr. White received a handsome _ douceur _ for his services .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 17]: Mrs. Hillmer did not even know of Sir Charles Dyke 's death until weeks had passed .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 34]: Acting on Bruce 's advice her brother simply told her that everything had been settled , and that the authorities concurred with the barrister in the opinion that Lady Dyke was accidently killed .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 30]: When she had completely recovered from the shock of the belief that her loyal friend had murdered his wife , Mensmore one day told her the whole sad story .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 8]: But he would allow no more weeping .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 19]: `` It is time , '' he said , `` that the misery of this episode should cease .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 35]: When the chief actor in the tragedy gave his life to end the suffering , we would but ill meet his wishes by allowing it to occupy our thoughts unduly in the future . ''
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 50]: Mensmore 's marriage with Phyllis Browne was now definitely fixed for the following autumn , so he carried his sister off with him on a hasty trip to Wyoming in company with Corbett -- a journey required for the protection and development of their joint interests in that State .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 26]: Not only did their property turn out to be of great and lasting value , but during their absence the Springbok Mine began to boom .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 34]: Even the cautious barrister one day found himself hesitating whether or not to sell at half over par , so excellent were the reports and so extensive the dividends from that auriferous locality .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 67]: The two young people were married , a scion of the house had become a lusty two-year-old , Mr. White had become Chief Inspector , and Miss Marie le Marchant had , by strenuous effort , risen to the dignity of double crown posters as a `` dashing comedienne '' -- when Bruce 's memories of his lost friends were suddenly revived in an unexpected manner .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 18]: Mr. Sydney H. Corbett came to him with measured questionings and brooding thought stamped on his brows .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 26]: `` It 's like this , '' he said , when they were settled down to details , `` I want to get married . ''
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 5]: `` To whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 15]: inquired Claude , wondering at the savage tone in which the announcement was made .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 6]: `` To Mrs. Hillmer . ''
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 12]: `` That 's what everybody yells the moment I mention it .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 6]: She screams ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 9]: and runs off with tears in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 7]: Her brother says ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 11]: and looks uncomfortable , but refuses to discuss the proposition .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 7]: Now you say ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 12]: and gaze at me like an owl at the bare statement .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 13]: What the dickens does it all mean , I want to know ?
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 10]: I 'm not worrying about what happened years ago .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 30]: Mrs. Hillmer is just the sort of woman I require as a wife , and I 'll marry her yet if the whole British nation says ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 13]: loud enough to be heard and answered by the U-nited States . ''
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 17]: `` That 's the proper sort of spirit in which to set about the business . ''
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 13]: `` Yes , sir ; but I ca n't get any forrarder .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 19]: There 's a kind of rock below water which holds me up every time I shoot the rapids .
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 9]: She likes me well enough , I know .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 38]: She calls me ` Syd ' as slick as butter , and I call her ` Gwen ' ; but there you are -- if I want to go ahead a bit she pulls up and weeps .
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 12]: Now , why the -- '' `` Steady , Mr. Corbett .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 6]: Women weep for many reasons .
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 7]: Do you know her history ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 11]: `` No , and I do n't want to . ''
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 11]: `` But perhaps that is exactly what she does want .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 13]: Remember that she has been married before , with somewhat bitter experience .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 16]: She probably believes that a husband and wife should have no secrets from each other .
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 16]: Above all else , there should be no cloud between them as to bygone events .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 6]: Mrs. Hillmer is highly sensitive .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 47]: If she imagined you were under any misapprehension as to the circumstances under which Sir Charles and Lady Dyke met their deaths -- do not forget that you were personally mixed up in the affair -- she would neither entertain your proposal nor explain her motives .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 14]: She would just do as you say -- run away and cry . ''
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 14]: `` Well , now , that beats everything , '' said Corbett admiringly .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 8]: `` That never struck me before . ''
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 13]: `` It is the probable explanation of her attitude , nevertheless . ''
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 9]: `` Then what am I to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 5]: `` Write to her .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 10]: Ask her permission to learn the facts from me .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 36]: Tell her you believe you understand the reasons for her reticence , and that your only excuse for the request is that you want to go to her on an equal plane of absolute confidence .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 27]: It seems to me -- '' `` That I 'd better get quick and do it , '' shouted Corbett , vanishing with the utmost celerity .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 10]: Bruce still occupied his old chambers in Victoria Street .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 14]: He did not expect to see Corbett again for a couple of days .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 12]: To the barrister 's utter amazement he returned within ten minutes .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 5]: `` Fire away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 4]: he cried excitedly .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 7]: `` You struck it first time .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 13]: I just rang her up -- '' `` Rang her up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 21]: `` Yes ; she 's staying at the Savoy for a few days , so I telephoned from the Windsor .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 14]: I could never fix up a letter in your words , you know .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 17]: But switch me on the end of a wire and I know where I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 9]: `` What on earth did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 26]: `` As soon as I got her in the box at the other end , I said , ` Is that you , Gwen ? '
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' said she .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 17]: ` Well , ' said I , ' I guess you know who 's talking ? '
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 8]: ` Quite well , ' said she .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 31]: ` Then , ' said I , ` I 've just been telling Mr. Bruce I wanted to marry you , and that you would n't even discuss the proposition .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 25]: He said you probably wished me to know the whole story of Sir Charles Dyke , but felt kinder shy of telling me yourself .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 26]: He will get it off his chest if you give him permission , and then I can come along in a hansom and fix things .
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 6]: What do you say ? '
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 15]: There was no answer , so I shouted , ` Are you there ? '
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 10]: and she said , ` Yes , ' faint-like .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 33]: ` Do n't let me hurry you , ' said I , ` but if you agree straight-away I can catch Bruce at home , for I 've just left him . '
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 9]: With that she said , ` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 7]: You can see Mr. Bruce . '
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 6]: And here I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 9]: `` Having accomplished the whole thing satisfactorily . ''
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 5]: `` As how ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 17]: `` Do n't you see you have proposed to the lady and practically been accepted ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 3]: `` Jehosh !
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 7]: It does look something like it .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 6]: Say , I 'm off !
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 10]: This story of yours will keep until to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 11]: He would have gone , but Bruce jumped after him .
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 8]: `` Not so fast , Mr. Corbett .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 12]: You must not sail into the Savoy flying a false flag .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 12]: Kindly oblige me with your attention for the next half-hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 20]: With that , he unlocked a safe and took from its recesses Sir Charles Dyke 's `` confession . ''
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 22]: He read the whole of its opening passages , explaining the relations between Mrs. Hillmer and her unfortunate but abiding friend .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 14]: The straightforward , honest sentences sounded strangely familiar at this distance of time .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 11]: Bruce was glad of the opportunity of reading them aloud .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 19]: It seemed a fitting thing that this testimony should come , as it were , from the tomb .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 18]: Corbett listened intently to the recital and to the barrister 's summary of the events that followed .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 5]: `` Poor chap ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 10]: he said , when the sad tale had ended .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 16]: `` I hope you shook hands with him as he asked you to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 4]: `` I did .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 16]: Would that my grasp had the power to reassure him of my heartfelt sympathy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 8]: For a little while they were silent .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 29]: `` So , '' said Corbett at last , `` Gwen thought I would make the same mistake as the poor lady , and suspect her wrongfully . ''
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 6]: `` No , not that .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 28]: But naturally she wished the man whom she could trust as a husband to be wholly cognizant of events in which already he had participated slightly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 5]: `` She was right .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 9]: I like her all the better for it .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 18]: But , tell me , is there any necessity for that wonderful document to be preserved ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 5]: `` Not the slightest .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 8]: It has served its last use . ''
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 9]: `` Then put it in the fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 12]: Bruce did not hesitate a moment to comply with the wish .
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 19]: The flames devoured the record with avidity , and the two men watched the manuscript crumbling into nothingness .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 14]: Then Corbett said : `` I must be off to the Savoy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 10]: `` Good-bye , old chap , '' said Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 9]: `` And good luck to you , too .
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 9]: I congratulate both Mrs. Hillmer and yourself . ''
