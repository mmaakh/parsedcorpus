Parsing [sent. 1 len. 17]: The Old Curiosity Shop by Charles Dickens Chapter 1 Night is generally my time for walking .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 72]: In the summer I often leave home early in the morning , and roam about fields and lanes all day , or even escape for days or weeks together ; but , saving in the country , I seldom go out until after dark , though , Heaven be thanked , I love its light and feel the cheerfulness it sheds upon the earth , as much as any creature living .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 35]: I have fallen insensibly into this habit , both because it favours my infirmity and because it affords me greater opportunity of speculating on the characters and occupations of those who fill the streets .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 85]: The glare and hurry of broad noon are not adapted to idle pursuits like mine ; a glimpse of passing faces caught by the light of a street-lamp or a shop window is often better for my purpose than their full revelation in the daylight ; and , if I must add the truth , night is kinder in this respect than day , which too often destroys an air-built castle at the moment of its completion , without the least ceremony or remorse .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 41]: That constant pacing to and fro , that never-ending restlessness , that incessant tread of feet wearing the rough stones smooth and glossy -- is it not a wonder how the dwellers in narrows ways can bear to hear it !
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 149]: Think of a sick man in such a place as Saint Martin 's Court , listening to the footsteps , and in the midst of pain and weariness obliged , despite himself -LRB- as though it were a task he must perform -RRB- to detect the child 's step from the man 's , the slipshod beggar from the booted exquisite , the lounging from the busy , the dull heel of the sauntering outcast from the quick tread of an expectant pleasure-seeker -- think of the hum and noise always being present to his sense , and of the stream of life that will not stop , pouring on , on , on , through all his restless dreams , as if he were condemned to lie , dead but conscious , in a noisy churchyard , and had no hope of rest for centuries to come .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 160]: Then , the crowds for ever passing and repassing on the bridges -LRB- on those which are free of toil at last -RRB- , where many stop on fine evenings looking listlessly down upon the water with some vague idea that by and by it runs between green banks which grow wider and wider until at last it joins the broad vast sea -- where some halt to rest from heavy loads and think as they look over the parapet that to smoke and lounge away one 's life , and lie sleeping in the sun upon a hot tarpaulin , in a dull , slow , sluggish barge , must be happiness unalloyed -- and where some , and a very different class , pause with heaver loads than they , remembering to have heard or read in old time that drowning was not a hard death , but of all means of suicide the easiest and best .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 58]: Covent Garden Market at sunrise too , in the spring or summer , when the fragrance of sweet flowers is in the air , over-powering even the unwholesome streams of last night 's debauchery , and driving the dusky thrust , whose cage has hung outside a garret window all night long , half mad with joy !
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 3]: Poor bird !
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 83]: the only neighbouring thing at all akin to the other little captives , some of whom , shrinking from the hot hands of drunken purchasers , lie drooping on the path already , while others , soddened by close contact , await the time when they shall be watered and freshened up to please more sober company , and make old clerks who pass them on their road to business , wonder what has filled their breasts with visions of the country .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 12]: But my present purpose is not to expatiate upon my walks .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 40]: The story I am about to relate , and to which I shall recur at intervals , arose out of one of these rambles ; and thus I have been led to speak of them by way of preface .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 66]: One night I had roamed into the City , and was walking slowly on in my usual way , musing upon a great many things , when I was arrested by an inquiry , the purport of which did not reach me , but which seemed to be addressed to myself , and was preferred in a soft sweet voice that struck me very pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 38]: I turned hastily round and found at my elbow a pretty little girl , who begged to be directed to a certain street at a considerable distance , and indeed in quite another quarter of the town .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 19]: It is a very long way from here , ' said I , ` my child . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 12]: I know that , sir , ' she replied timidly . '
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 18]: I am afraid it is a very long way , for I came from there to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 4]: ` Alone ? '
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 7]: said I , in some surprise .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 27]: ` Oh , yes , I do n't mind that , but I am a little frightened now , for I had lost my road . '
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 10]: ` And what made you ask it of me ?
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 9]: Suppose I should tell you wrong ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 31]: I am sure you will not do that , ' said the little creature , ' you are such a very old gentleman , and walk so slow yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 46]: I can not describe how much I was impressed by this appeal and the energy with which it was made , which brought a tear into the child 's clear eye , and made her slight figure tremble as she looked up into my face .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 15]: ` Come , ' said I , ` I 'll take you there . '
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 50]: She put her hand in mind as confidingly as if she had known me from her cradle , and we trudged away together ; the little creature accommodating her pace to mine , and rather seeming to lead and take care of me than I to be protecting her .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 51]: I observed that every now and then she stole a curious look at my face , as if to make quite sure that I was not deceiving her , and that these glances -LRB- very sharp and keen they were too -RRB- seemed to increase her confidence at every repetition .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 50]: For my part , my curiosity and interest were at least equal to the child 's , for child she certainly was , although I thought it probably from what I could make out , that her very small and delicate frame imparted a peculiar youthfulness to her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 25]: Though more scantily attired than she might have been she was dressed with perfect neatness , and betrayed no marks of poverty or neglect .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 11]: ` Who has sent you so far by yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 14]: said I. ` Someone who is very kind to me , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 9]: ` And what have you been doing ? '
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 14]: ` That , I must not tell , ' said the child firmly .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 44]: There was something in the manner of this reply which caused me to look at the little creature with an involuntary expression of surprise ; for I wondered what kind of errand it might be that occasioned her to be prepared for questioning .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 45]: Her quick eye seemed to read my thoughts , for as it met mine she added that there was no harm in what she had been doing , but it was a great secret -- a secret which she did not even know herself .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 23]: This was said with no appearance of cunning or deceit , but with an unsuspicious frankness that bore the impress of truth .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 49]: She walked on as before , growing more familiar with me as we proceeded and talking cheerfully by the way , but she said no more about her home , beyond remarking that we were going quite a new road and asking if it were a short one .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 24]: While we were thus engaged , I revolved in my mind a hundred different explanations of the riddle and rejected them every one .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 24]: I really felt ashamed to take advantage of the ingenuousness or grateful feeling of the child for the purpose of gratifying my curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 26]: I love these little people ; and it is not a slight thing when they , who are so fresh from God , love us .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 33]: As I had felt pleased at first by her confidence I determined to deserve it , and to do credit to the nature which had prompted her to repose it in me .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 87]: There was no reason , however , why I should refrain from seeing the person who had inconsiderately sent her to so great a distance by night and alone , and as it was not improbable that if she found herself near home she might take farewell of me and deprive me of the opportunity , I avoided the most frequented ways and took the most intricate , and thus it was not until we arrived in the street itself that she knew where we were .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 39]: Clapping her hands with pleasure and running on before me for a short distance , my little acquaintance stopped at a door and remaining on the step till I came up knocked at it when I joined her .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 49]: A part of this door was of glass unprotected by any shutter , which I did not observe at first , for all was very dark and silent within , and I was anxious -LRB- as indeed the child was also -RRB- for an answer to our summons .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 76]: When she had knocked twice or thrice there was a noise as if some person were moving inside , and at length a faint light appeared through the glass which , as it approached very slowly , the bearer having to make his way through a great many scattered articles , enabled me to see both what kind of person it was who advanced and what kind of place it was through which he came .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 35]: It was an old man with long grey hair , whose face and figure as he held the light above his head and looked before him as he approached , I could plainly see .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 30]: Though much altered by age , I fancied I could recognize in his spare and slender form something of that delicate mould which I had noticed in a child .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 28]: Their bright blue eyes were certainly alike , but his face was so deeply furrowed and so very full of care , that here all resemblance ceased .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 45]: The place through which he made his way at leisure was one of those receptacles for old and curious things which seem to crouch in odd corners of this town and to hide their musty treasures from the public eye in jealousy and distrust .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 50]: There were suits of mail standing like ghosts in armour here and there , fantastic carvings brought from monkish cloisters , rusty weapons of various kinds , distorted figures in china and wood and iron and ivory : tapestry and strange furniture that might have been designed in dreams .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 37]: The haggard aspect of the little old man was wonderfully suited to the place ; he might have groped among old churches and tombs and deserted houses and gathered all the spoils with his own hands .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 23]: There was nothing in the whole collection but was in keeping with himself nothing that looked older or more worn than he .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 28]: As he turned the key in the lock , he surveyed me with some astonishment which was not diminished when he looked from me to my companion .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 22]: The door being opened , the child addressed him as grandfather , and told him the little story of our companionship .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 28]: ` Why , bless thee , child , ' said the old man , patting her on the head , ` how couldst thou miss thy way ?
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 11]: What if I had lost thee , Nell ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 23]: I would have found my way back to YOU , grandfather , ' said the child boldly ; ` never fear . '
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 21]: The old man kissed her , then turning to me and begging me to walk in , I did so .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 7]: The door was closed and locked .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 62]: Preceding me with the light , he led me through the place I had already seen from without , into a small sitting-room behind , in which was another door opening into a kind of closet , where I saw a little bed that a fairy might have slept in , it looked so very small and was so prettily arranged .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 20]: The child took a candle and tripped into this little room , leaving the old man and me together .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 28]: ` You must be tired , sir , ' said he as he placed a chair near the fire , ` how can I thank you ? '
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 19]: ` By taking more care of your grandchild another time , my good friend , ' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 5]: ` More care ! '
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 15]: said the old man in a shrill voice , ` more care of Nelly !
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 13]: Why , who ever loved a child as I love Nell ? '
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 70]: He said this with such evident surprise that I was perplexed what answer to make , and the more so because coupled with something feeble and wandering in his manner , there were in his face marks of deep and anxious thought which convinced me that he could not be , as I had been at first inclined to suppose , in a state of dotage or imbecility . '
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 12]: I do n't think you consider -- ' I began . '
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 6]: I do n't consider ! '
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 14]: cried the old man interrupting me , ' I do n't consider her !
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 10]: Ah , how little you know of the truth !
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 7]: Little Nelly , little Nelly ! '
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 35]: It would be impossible for any man , I care not what his form of speech might be , to express more affection than the dealer in curiosities did , in these four words .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 30]: I waited for him to speak again , but he rested his chin upon his hand and shaking his head twice or thrice fixed his eyes upon the fire .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 44]: While we were sitting thus in silence , the door of the closet opened , and the child returned , her light brown hair hanging loose about her neck , and her face flushed with the haste she had made to rejoin us .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 34]: She busied herself immediately in preparing supper , and while she was thus engaged I remarked that the old man took an opportunity of observing me more closely than he had done yet .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 31]: I was surprised to see that all this time everything was done by the child , and that there appeared to be no other persons but ourselves in the house .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 38]: I took advantage of a moment when she was absent to venture a hint on this point , to which the old man replied that there were few grown persons as trustworthy or as careful as she .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 45]: ` It always grieves me , ' I observed , roused by what I took to be his selfishness , ` it always grieves me to contemplate the initiation of children into the ways of life , when they are scarcely more than infants .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 35]: It checks their confidence and simplicity -- two of the best qualities that Heaven gives them -- and demands that they share our sorrows before they are capable of entering into our enjoyments . '
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 24]: ` It will never check hers , ' said the old man looking steadily at me , ` the springs are too deep .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 12]: Besides , the children of the poor know but few pleasures .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 13]: Even the cheap delights of childhood must be bought and paid for .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 35]: ` But -- forgive me for saying this -- you are surely not so very poor ' -- said I. ` She is not my child , sir , ' returned the old man .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 10]: ` Her mother was , and she was poor .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 46]: I save nothing -- not a penny -- though I live as you see , but ' -- he laid his hand upon my arm and leant forward to whisper -- ` she shall be rich one of these days , and a fine lady .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 13]: Do n't you think ill of me because I use her help .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 33]: She gives it cheerfully as you see , and it would break her heart if she knew that I suffered anybody else to do for me what her little hands could undertake .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 6]: I do n't consider ! '
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 37]: -- he cried with sudden querulousness , ` why , God knows that this one child is there thought and object of my life , and yet he never prospers me -- no , never ! '
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 32]: At this juncture , the subject of our conversation again returned , and the old men motioning to me to approach the table , broke off , and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 57]: We had scarcely begun our repast when there was a knock at the door by which I had entered , and Nell bursting into a hearty laugh , which I was rejoiced to hear , for it was childlike and full of hilarity , said it was no doubt dear old Kit coming back at last .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 5]: ` Foolish Nell ! '
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 9]: said the old man fondling with her hair .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 9]: ` She always laughs at poor Kit . '
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 18]: The child laughed again more heartily than before , I could not help smiling from pure sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 15]: The little old man took up a candle and went to open the door .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 11]: When he came back , Kit was at his heels .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 35]: Kit was a shock-headed , shambling , awkward lad with an uncommonly wide mouth , very red cheeks , a turned-up nose , and certainly the most comical expression of face I ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 62]: He stopped short at the door on seeing a stranger , twirled in his hand a perfectly round old hat without any vestige of a brim , and resting himself now on one leg and now on the other and changing them constantly , stood in the doorway , looking into the parlour with the most extraordinary leer I ever beheld .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 27]: I entertained a grateful feeling towards the boy from that minute , for I felt that he was the comedy of the child 's life . '
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 11]: A long way , was n't it , Kit ? '
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 6]: said the little old man .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 17]: ` Why , then , it was a goodish stretch , master , ' returned Kit .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 10]: ` Of course you have come back hungry ? '
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 19]: ` Why , then , I do consider myself rather so , master , ' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 36]: The lad had a remarkable manner of standing sideways as he spoke , and thrusting his head forward over his shoulder , as if he could not get at his voice without that accompanying action .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 48]: I think he would have amused one anywhere , but the child 's exquisite enjoyment of his oddity , and the relief it was to find that there was something she associated with merriment in a place that appeared so unsuited to her , were quite irresistible .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 49]: It was a great point too that Kit himself was flattered by the sensation he created , and after several efforts to preserve his gravity , burst into a loud roar , and so stood with his mouth wide open and his eyes nearly shut , laughing violently .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 60]: The old man had again relapsed into his former abstraction and took no notice of what passed , but I remarked that when her laugh was over , the child 's bright eyes were dimmed with tears , called forth by the fullness of heart with which she welcomed her uncouth favourite after the little anxiety of the night .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 54]: As for Kit himself -LRB- whose laugh had been all the time one of that sort which very little would change into a cry -RRB- he carried a large slice of bread and meat and a mug of beer into a corner , and applied himself to disposing of them with great voracity .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 42]: said the old man turning to me with a sigh , as if I had spoken to him but that moment , ` you do n't know what you say when you tell me that I do n't consider her . '
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 35]: ` You must not attach too great weight to a remark founded on first appearances , my friend , ' said I. ` No , ' returned the old man thoughtfully , ` no .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 6]: Come hither , Nell . '
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 16]: The little girl hastened from her seat , and put her arm about his neck .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 9]: ` Do I love thee , Nell ? '
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 14]: ` Say -- do I love thee , Nell , or no ? '
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 16]: The child only answered by her caresses , and laid her head upon his breast .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 7]: ` Why dost thou sob ? '
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 14]: said the grandfather , pressing her closer to him and glancing towards me .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 27]: ` Is it because thou know ` st I love thee , and dost not like that I should seem to doubt it by my question ?
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 14]: Well , well -- then let us say I love thee dearly . '
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 22]: ` Indeed , indeed you do , ' replied the child with great earnestness , ` Kit knows you do . '
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 72]: Kit , who in despatching his bread and meat had been swallowing two-thirds of his knife at every mouthful with the coolness of a juggler , stopped short in his operations on being thus appealed to , and bawled ` Nobody is n't such a fool as to say he doos n't , ' after which he incapacitated himself for further conversation by taking a most prodigious sandwich at one bite .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 34]: ` She is poor now ' -- said the old men , patting the child 's cheek , ` but I say again that the time is coming when she shall be rich .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 26]: It has been a long time coming , but it must come at last ; a very long time , but it surely must come .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 14]: It has come to other men who do nothing but waste and riot .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 9]: When WILL it come to me ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 15]: I am very happy as I am , grandfather , ' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 6]: ` Tush , tush ! '
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 18]: returned the old man , ` thou dost not know -- how should ` st thou ! '
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 21]: then he muttered again between his teeth , ` The time must come , I am very sure it must .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 40]: It will be all the better for coming late ' ; and then he sighed and fell into his former musing state , and still holding the child between his knees appeared to be insensible to everything around him .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 23]: By this time it wanted but a few minutes of midnight and I rose to go , which recalled him to himself .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 25]: ` One moment , sir , ' he said , ` Now , Kit -- near midnight , boy , and you still here !
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 23]: Get home , get home , and be true to your time in the morning , for there 's work to do .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 3]: Good night !
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 16]: There , bid him good night , Nell , and let him be gone ! '
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 21]: ` Good night , Kit , ' said the child , her eyes lighting up with merriment and kindness . '
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 12]: ` Good night , Miss Nell , ' returned the boy .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 27]: ` And thank this gentleman , ' interposed the old man , ` but for whose care I might have lost my little girl to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 22]: ` No , no , master , ' said Kit , ` that wo n't do , that wo n't . '
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 5]: cried the old man .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 20]: ` I 'd have found her , master , ' said Kit , ` I 'd have found her .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 24]: I 'll bet that I 'd find her if she was above ground , I would , as quick as anybody , master .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 7]: Ha , ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 28]: Once more opening his mouth and shutting his eyes , and laughing like a stentor , Kit gradually backed to the door , and roared himself out .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 76]: Free of the room , the boy was not slow in taking his departure ; when he had gone , and the child was occupied in clearing the table , the old man said : ' I have n't seemed to thank you , sir , for what you have done to-night , but I do thank you humbly and heartily , and so does she , and her thanks are better worth than mine .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 29]: I should be sorry that you went away , and thought I was unmindful of your goodness , or careless of her -- I am not indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 15]: I was sure of that , I said , from what I had seen .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 16]: ` But , ' I added , ` may I ask you a question ? '
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 17]: ` Ay , sir , ' replied the old man , ` What is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 27]: ` This delicate child , ' said I , ` with so much beauty and intelligence -- has she nobody to care for her but you ?
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 9]: Has she no other companion or advisor ? '
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 23]: ` No , ' he returned , looking anxiously in my face , ` no , and she wants no other . '
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 21]: ` But are you not fearful , ' said I , ` that you may misunderstand a charge so tender ?
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 24]: I am sure you mean well , but are you quite certain that you know how to execute such a trust as this ?
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 27]: I am an old man , like you , and I am actuated by an old man 's concern in all that is young and promising .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 27]: Do you not think that what I have seen of you and this little creature to-night must have an interest not wholly free from pain ? '
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 15]: ` Sir , ' rejoined the old man after a moment 's silence . '
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 12]: I have no right to feel hurt at what you say .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 24]: It is true that in many respects I am the child , and she the grown person -- that you have seen already .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 46]: But waking or sleeping , by night or day , in sickness or health , she is the one object of my care , and if you knew of how much care , you would look on me with different eyes , you would indeed .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 32]: It 's a weary life for an old man -- a weary , weary life -- but there is a great end to gain and that I keep before me . '
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 36]: Seeing that he was in a state of excitement and impatience , I turned to put on an outer coat which I had thrown off on entering the room , purposing to say no more .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 27]: I was surprised to see the child standing patiently by with a cloak upon her arm , and in her hand a hat , and stick .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 27]: ` Those are not mine , my dear , ' said I. ` No , ' returned the child , ` they are grandfather 's . '
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 10]: ` But he is not going out to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 17]: ` Oh , yes , he is , ' said the child , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 12]: ` And what becomes of you , my pretty one ? '
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 3]: ` Me !
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 6]: I stay here of course .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 5]: I always do . '
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 26]: I looked in astonishment towards the old man , but he was , or feigned to be , busied in the arrangement of his dress .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 14]: From him I looked back to the slight gentle figure of the child .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 2]: Alone !
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 11]: In that gloomy place all the long , dreary night .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 31]: She evinced no consciousness of my surprise , but cheerfully helped the old man with his cloak , and when he was ready took a candle to light us out .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 21]: Finding that we did not follow as she expected , she looked back with a smile and waited for us .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 42]: The old man showed by his face that he plainly understood the cause of my hesitation , but he merely signed to me with an inclination of the head to pass out of the room before him , and remained silent .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 8]: I had no resource but to comply .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 26]: When we reached the door , the child setting down the candle , turned to say good night and raised her face to kiss me .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 20]: Then she ran to the old man , who folded her in his arms and bade God bless her .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 21]: ` Sleep soundly , Nell , ' he said in a low voice , ` and angels guard thy bed !
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 10]: Do not forget thy prayers , my sweet . '
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 20]: ` No , indeed , ' answered the child fervently , ` they make me feel so happy ! '
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 19]: ` That 's well ; I know they do ; they should , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 7]: ` Bless thee a hundred times !
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 10]: Early in the morning I shall be home . '
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 12]: ` You 'll not ring twice , ' returned the child .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 15]: ` The bell wakes me , even in the middle of a dream . '
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 6]: With this , they separated .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 49]: The child opened the door -LRB- now guarded by a shutter which I had heard the boy put up before he left the house -RRB- and with another farewell whose clear and tender note I have recalled a thousand times , held it until we had passed out .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 31]: The old man paused a moment while it was gently closed and fastened on the inside , and satisfied that this was done , walked on at a slow pace .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 28]: At the street-corner he stopped , and regarding me with a troubled countenance said that our ways were widely different and that he must take his leave .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 25]: I would have spoken , but summoning up more alacrity than might have been expected in one of his appearance , he hurried away .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 35]: I could see that twice or thrice he looked back as if to ascertain if I were still watching him , or perhaps to assure himself that I was not following at a distance .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 18]: The obscurity of the night favoured his disappearance , and his figure was soon beyond my sight .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 25]: I remained standing on the spot where he had left me , unwilling to depart , and yet unknowing why I should loiter there .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 21]: I looked wistfully into the street we had lately quitted , and after a time directed my steps that way .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 25]: I passed and repassed the house , and stopped and listened at the door ; all was dark , and silent as the grave .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 49]: Yet I lingered about , and could not tear myself away , thinking of all possible harm that might happen to the child -- of fires and robberies and even murder -- and feeling as if some evil must ensure if I turned my back upon the place .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 41]: The closing of a door or window in the street brought me before the curiosity-dealer 's once more ; I crossed the road and looked up at the house to assure myself that the noise had not come from there .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 13]: No , it was black , cold , and lifeless as before .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 19]: There were few passengers astir ; the street was sad and dismal , and pretty well my own .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 36]: A few stragglers from the theatres hurried by , and now and then I turned aside to avoid some noisy drunkard as he reeled homewards , but these interruptions were not frequent and soon ceased .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 5]: The clocks struck one .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 33]: Still I paced up and down , promising myself that every time should be the last , and breaking faith with myself on some new plea as often as I did so .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 32]: The more I thought of what the old man had said , and of his looks and bearing , the less I could account for what I had seen and heard .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 15]: I had a strong misgiving that his nightly absence was for no good purpose .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 48]: I had only come to know the fact through the innocence of the child , and though the old man was by at the time , and saw my undisguised surprise , he had preserved a strange mystery upon the subject and offered no word of explanation .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 22]: These reflections naturally recalled again more strongly than before his haggard face , his wandering manner , his restless anxious looks .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 35]: His affection for the child might not be inconsistent with villany of the worst kind ; even that very affection was in itself an extraordinary contradiction , or how could he leave her thus ?
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 21]: Disposed as I was to think badly of him , I never doubted that his love for her was real .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 29]: I could not admit the thought , remembering what had passed between us , and the tone of voice in which he had called her by her name .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 23]: ` Stay here of course , ' the child had said in answer to my question , ' I always do ! '
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 13]: What could take him from home by night , and every night !
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 64]: I called up all the strange tales I had ever heard of dark and secret deeds committed in great towns and escaping detection for a long series of years ; wild as many of these stories were , I could not find one adapted to this mystery , which only became the more impenetrable , in proportion as I sought to solve it .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 65]: Occupied with such thoughts as these , and a crowd of others all tending to the same point , I continued to pace the street for two long hours ; at length the rain began to descend heavily , and then over-powered by fatigue though no less interested than I had been at first , I engaged the nearest coach and so got home .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 45]: A cheerful fire was blazing on the hearth , the lamp burnt brightly , my clock received me with its old familiar welcome ; everything was quiet , warm and cheering , and in happy contrast to the gloom and darkness I had quitted .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 25]: But all that night , waking or in my sleep , the same thoughts recurred and the same images retained possession of my brain .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 75]: I had ever before me the old dark murky rooms -- the gaunt suits of mail with their ghostly silent air -- the faces all awry , grinning from wood and stone -- the dust and rust and worm that lives in wood -- and alone in the midst of all this lumber and decay and ugly age , the beautiful child in her gentle slumber , smiling through her light and sunny dreams .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 59]: Chapter 2 After combating , for nearly a week , the feeling which impelled me to revisit the place I had quitted under the circumstances already detailed , I yielded to it at length ; and determining that this time I would present myself by the light of day , bent my steps thither early in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 46]: I walked past the house , and took several turns in the street , with that kind of hesitation which is natural to a man who is conscious that the visit he is about to pay is unexpected , and may not be very acceptable .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 54]: However , as the door of the shop was shut , and it did not appear likely that I should be recognized by those within , if I continued merely to pass up and down before it , I soon conquered this irresolution , and found myself in the Curiosity Dealer 's warehouse .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 64]: The old man and another person were together in the back part , and there seemed to have been high words between them , for their voices which were raised to a very high pitch suddenly stopped on my entering , and the old man advancing hastily towards me , said in a tremulous tone that he was very glad I had come .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 37]: ` You interrupted us at a critical moment , ' said he , pointing to the man whom I had found in company with him ; ` this fellow will murder me one of these days .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 15]: He would have done so , long ago , if he had dared . '
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 3]: ` Bah !
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 33]: You would swear away my life if you could , ' returned the other , after bestowing a stare and a frown on me ; ` we all know that ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 17]: I almost think I could , ' cried the old man , turning feebly upon him .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 19]: ` If oaths , or prayers , or words , could rid me of you , they should .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 18]: I would be quit of you , and would be relieved if you were dead . ' '
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 10]: I know it , ' returned the other . '
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 8]: I said so , did n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 25]: But neither oaths , or prayers , nor words , WILL kill me , and therefore I live , and mean to live . '
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 7]: ` And his mother died ! '
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 22]: cried the old man , passionately clasping his hands and looking upward ; ` and this is Heaven 's justice ! '
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 19]: The other stood lunging with his foot upon a chair , and regarded him with a contemptuous sneer .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 48]: He was a young man of one-and-twenty or thereabouts ; well made , and certainly handsome , though the expression of his face was far from prepossessing , having in common with his manner and even his dress , a dissipated , insolent air which repelled one .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 50]: ` Justice or no justice , ' said the young fellow , ` here I am and here I shall stop till such time as I think fit to go , unless you send for assistance to put me out -- which you wo n't do , I know .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 13]: I tell you again that I want to see my sister . '
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 5]: ` YOUR sister ! '
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 6]: said the old man bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 12]: You ca n't change the relationship , ' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 13]: ` If you could , you 'd have done it long ago .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 51]: I want to see my sister , that you keep cooped up here , poisoning her mind with your sly secrets and pretending an affection for her that you may work her to death , and add a few scraped shillings every week to the money you can hardly count .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 11]: I want to see her ; and I will . '
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 11]: ` Here 's a moralist to talk of poisoned minds !
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 11]: Here 's a generous spirit to scorn scraped-up shillings ! '
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 12]: cried the old man , turning from him to me . '
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 36]: A profligate , sir , who has forfeited every claim not only upon those who have the misfortune to be of his blood , but upon society which knows nothing of him but his misdeeds .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 45]: A liar too , ' he added , in a lower voice as he drew closer to me , ` who knows how dear she is to me , and seeks to wound me even there , because there is a stranger nearby . '
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 28]: ` Strangers are nothing to me , grandfather , ' said the young fellow catching at the word , ` nor I to them , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 20]: The best they can do , is to keep an eye to their business and leave me to mind .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 33]: There 's a friend of mine waiting outside , and as it seems that I may have to wait some time , I 'll call him in , with your leave . '
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 50]: Saying this , he stepped to the door , and looking down the street beckoned several times to some unseen person , who , to judge from the air of impatience with which these signals were accompanied , required a great quantity of persuasion to induce him to advance .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 60]: At length there sauntered up , on the opposite side of the way -- with a bad pretense of passing by accident -- a figure conspicuous for its dirty smartness , which after a great many frowns and jerks of the head , in resistence of the invitation , ultimately crossed the road and was brought into the shop .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 3]: ` There .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 15]: It 's Dick Swiveller , ' said the young fellow , pushing him in .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 7]: ` Sit down , Swiveller . '
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 9]: ` But is the old min agreeable ? '
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 7]: said Mr Swiveller in an undertone .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 88]: Mr Swiveller complied , and looking about him with a propritiatory smile , observed that last week was a fine week for the ducks , and this week was a fine week for the dust ; he also observed that whilst standing by the post at the street-corner , he had observed a pig with a straw in his mouth issuing out of the tobacco-shop , from which appearance he augured that another fine week for the ducks was approaching , and that rain would certainly ensue .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 63]: He furthermore took occasion to apologize for any negligence that might be perceptible in his dress , on the ground that last night he had had ` the sun very strong in his eyes ' ; by which expression he was understood to convey to his hearers in the most delicate manner possible , the information that he had been extremely drunk .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 42]: ` But what , ' said Mr Swiveller with a sigh , ` what is the odds so long as the fire of soul is kindled at the taper of conwiviality , and the wing of friendship never moults a feather !
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 30]: What is the odds so long as the spirit is expanded by means of rosy wine , and the present moment is the least happiest of our existence ! '
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 17]: ` You need n't act the chairman here , ' said his friend , half aside .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 4]: ` Fred ! '
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 30]: cried Mr Swiveller , tapping his nose , ' a word to the wise is sufficient for them -- we may be good and happy without riches , Fred .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 5]: Say not another syllable .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 10]: I know my cue ; smart is the word .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 14]: Only one little whisper , Fred -- is the old min friendly ? '
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 10]: ` Never you mind , ' repled his friend .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 25]: ` Right again , quite right , ' said Mr Swiveller , ` caution is the word , and caution is the act . '
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 34]: with that , he winked as if in preservation of some deep secret , and folding his arms and leaning back in his chair , looked up at the ceiling with profound gravity .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 66]: It was perhaps not very unreasonable to suspect from what had already passed , that Mr Swiveller was not quite recovered from the effects of the powerful sunlight to which he had made allusion ; but if no such suspicion had been awakened by his speech , his wiry hair , dull eyes , and sallow face would still have been strong witnesses against him .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 38]: His attire was not , as he had himself hinted , remarkable for the nicest arrangement , but was in a state of disorder which strongly induced the idea that he had gone to bed in it .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 54]: It consisted of a brown body-coat with a great many brass buttons up the front and only one behind , a bright check neckerchief , a plaid waistcoat , soiled white trousers , and a very limp hat , worn with the wrong side foremost , to hide a hole in the brim .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 81]: The breast of his coat was ornamented with an outside pocket from which there peeped forth the cleanest end of a very large and very ill-favoured handkerchief ; his dirty wristbands were pulled on as far as possible and ostentatiously folded back over his cuffs ; he displayed no gloves , and carried a yellow cane having at the top a bone hand with the semblance of a ring on its little finger and a black ball in its grasp .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 78]: With all these personal advantages -LRB- to which may be added a strong savour of tobacco-smoke , and a prevailing greasiness of appearance -RRB- Mr Swiveller leant back in his chair with his eyes fixed on the ceiling , and occasionally pitching his voice to the needful key , obliged the company with a few bars of an intensely dismal air , and then , in the middle of a note , relapsed into his former silence .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 47]: The old man sat himself down in a chair , and with folded hands , looked sometimes at his grandson and sometimes at his strange companion , as if he were utterly powerless and had no resource but to leave them to do as they pleased .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 83]: The young man reclined against a table at no great distance from his friend , in apparent indifference to everything that had passed ; and I -- who felt the difficulty of any interference , notwithstanding that the old man had appealed to me , both by words and looks -- made the best feint I could of being occupied in examining some of the goods that were disposed for sale , and paying very little attention to a person before me .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 61]: The silence was not of long duration , for Mr Swiveller , after favouring us with several melodious assurances that his heart was in the Highlands , and that he wanted but his Arab steed as a preliminary to the achievement of great feats of valour and loyalty , removed his eyes from the ceiling and subsided into prose again .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 38]: ` Fred , ' said Mr Swiveller stopping short , as if the idea had suddenly occurred to him , and speaking in the same audible whisper as before , ` is the old min friendly ? '
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 7]: ` What does it matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 5]: returned his friend peevishly .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 8]: ` No , but IS he ? '
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 6]: ` Yes , of course .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 11]: What do I care whether he is or not ? '
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 26]: Emboldened as it seemed by this reply to enter into a more general conversation , Mr Swiveller plainly laid himself out to captivate our attention .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 55]: He began by remarking that soda-water , though a good thing in the abstract , was apt to lie cold upon the stomach unless qualified with ginger , or a small infusion of brandy , which latter article he held to be preferable in all cases , saving for the one consideration of expense .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 106]: Nobody venturing to dispute these positions , he proceeded to observe that the human hair was a great retainer of tobacco-smoke , and that the young gentlemen of Westminster and Eton , after eating vast quantities of apples to conceal any scent of cigars from their anxious friends , were usually detected in consequence of their heads possessing this remarkable property ; when he concluded that if the Royal Society would turn their attention to the circumstance , and endeavour to find in the resources of science a means of preventing such untoward revelations , they might indeed be looked upon as benefactors to mankind .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 69]: These opinions being equally incontrovertible with those he had already pronounced , he went on to inform us that Jamaica rum , though unquestionably an agreeable spirit of great richness and flavour , had the drawback of remaining constantly present to the taste next day ; and nobody being venturous enough to argue this point either , he increased in confidence and became yet more companionable and communicative .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 24]: ` It 's a devil of a thing , gentlemen , ' said Mr Swiveller , ` when relations fall out and disagree .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 27]: If the wing of friendship should never moult a feather , the wing of relationship should never be clipped , but be always expanded and serene .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 22]: Why should a grandson and grandfather peg away at each other with mutual wiolence when all might be bliss and concord .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 9]: Why not jine hands and forgit it ? '
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 10]: ` Hold your tongue , ' said his friend .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 16]: ` Sir , ' replied Mr Swiveller , ` do n't you interrupt the chair .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 13]: Gentlemen , how does the case stand , upon the present occasion ?
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 24]: Here is a jolly old grandfather -- I say it with the utmost respect -- and here is a wild , young grandson .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 68]: The jolly old grandfather says to the wild young grandson , ' I have brought you up and educated you , Fred ; I have put you in the way of getting on in life ; you have bolted a little out of course , as young fellows often do ; and you shall never have another chance , nor the ghost of half a one . '
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 77]: The wild young grandson makes answer to this and says , ` You 're as rich as rich can be ; you have been at no uncommon expense on my account , you 're saving up piles of money for my little sister that lives with you in a secret , stealthy , hugger-muggering kind of way and with no manner of enjoyment -- why ca n't you stand a trifle for your grown-up relation ? '
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 55]: The jolly old grandfather unto this , retorts , not only that he declines to fork out with that cheerful readiness which is always so agreeable and pleasant in a gentleman of his time of life , but that he will bow up , and call names , and make reflections whenever they meet .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 47]: Then the plain question is , a n't it a pity that this state of things should continue , and how much better would it be for the gentleman to hand over a reasonable amount of tin , and make it all right and comfortable ? '
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 45]: Having delivered this oration with a great many waves and flourishes of the hand , Mr Swiveller abruptly thrust the head of his cane into his mouth as if to prevent himself from impairing the effect of his speech by adding one other word .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 14]: ` Why do you hunt and persecute me , God help me ! '
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 9]: said the old man turning to his grandson .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 10]: ` Why do you bring your prolifigate companions here ?
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 24]: How often am I to tell you that my life is one of care and self-denial , and that I am poor ? '
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 26]: ` How often am I to tell you , ' returned the other , looking coldly at him , ` that I know better ? '
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 14]: ` You have chosen your own path , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 4]: ` Follow it .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 10]: Leave Nell and me to toil and work . '
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 33]: ` Nell will be a woman soon , ' returned the other , ` and , bred in your faith , she 'll forget her brother unless he shows himself sometimes . '
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 28]: ` Take care , ' said the old man with sparkling eyes , ` that she does not forget you when you would have her memory keenest .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 29]: Take care that the day do n't come when you walk barefoot in the streets , and she rides by in a gay carriage of her own . '
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 10]: ` You mean when she has your money ? '
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 4]: retorted the other .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 10]: ` How like a poor man he talks ! '
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 33]: ` And yet , ' said the old man dropping his voice and speaking like one who thinks aloud , ` how poor we are , and what a life it is !
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 21]: The cause is a young child 's guiltless of all harm or wrong , but nothing goes well with it !
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 9]: Hope and patience , hope and patience ! '
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 18]: These words were uttered in too low a tone to reach the ears of the young men .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 51]: Mr Swiveller appeared to think the they implied some mental struggle consequent upon the powerful effect of his address , for he poked his friend with his cane and whispered his conviction that he had administered ' a clincher , ' and that he expected a commission on the profits .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 40]: Discovering his mistake after a while , he appeared to grow rather sleeply and discontented , and had more than once suggested the proprieity of an immediate departure , when the door opened , and the child herself appeared .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 46]: Chapter 3 The child was closely followed by an elderly man of remarkably hard features and forbidding aspect , and so low in stature as to be quite a dwarf , though his head and face were large enough for the body of a giant .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 41]: His black eyes were restless , sly , and cunning ; his mouth and chin , bristly with the stubble of a coarse hard beard ; and his complexion was one of that kind which never looks clean or wholesome .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 62]: But what added most to the grotesque expression of his face was a ghastly smile , which , appearing to be the mere result of habit and to have no connection with any mirthful or complacent feeling , constantly revealed the few discoloured fangs that were yet scattered in his mouth , and gave him the aspect of a panting dog .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 39]: His dress consisted of a large high-crowned hat , a worn dark suit , a pair of capacious shoes , and a dirty white neckerchief sufficiently limp and crumpled to disclose the greater portion of his wiry throat .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 29]: Such hair as he had was of a grizzled black , cut short and straight upon his temples , and hanging in a frowzy fringe about his ears .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 26]: His hands , which were of a rough , coarse grain , were very dirty ; his fingernails were crooked , long , and yellow .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 30]: There was ample time to note these particulars , for besides that they were sufficiently obvious without very close observation , some moments elapsed before any one broke silence .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 48]: The child advanced timidly towards her brother and put her hand in his , the dwarf -LRB- if we may call him so -RRB- glanced keenly at all present , and the curiosity-dealer , who plainly had not expected his uncouth visitor , seemed disconcerted and embarrassed .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 31]: said the dwarf , who with his hand stretched out above his eyes had been surveying the young man attentively , ` that should be your grandson , neighbour ! '
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 15]: ` Say rather that he should not be , ' replied the old man .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 6]: ` But he is . '
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 5]: ` And that ? '
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 9]: said the dwarf , pointing to Dick Swiveller .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 18]: ` Some friend of his , as welcome here as he , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 5]: ` And that ? '
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 13]: inquired the dwarf , wheeling round and pointing straight at me . '
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 26]: A gentleman who was so good as to bring Nell home the other night when she lost her way , coming from your house . '
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 38]: The little man turned to the child as if to chide her or express his wonder , but as she was talking to the young man , held his peace , and bent his head to listen .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 12]: ` Well , Nelly , ' said the young fellow aloud .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 12]: ` Do they teach you to hate me , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 5]: ` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 3]: For shame .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 5]: Oh , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 4]: cried the child .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 8]: ` To love me , perhaps ? '
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 7]: pursued her brother with a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 9]: ` To do neither , ' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 9]: ` They never speak to me about you .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 7]: Indeed they never do . ' '
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 20]: I dare be bound for that , ' he said , darting a bitter look at the grandfather . '
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 8]: I dare be bound for that Nell .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 6]: I believe you there ! '
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 14]: ` But I love you dearly , Fred , ' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 6]: ` No doubt ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 20]: I do indeed , and always will , ' the child repeated with great emotion , ` but oh !
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 21]: If you would leave off vexing him and making him unhappy , then I could love you more . ' '
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 4]: I see ! '
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 36]: said the young man , as he stooped carelessly over the child , and having kissed her , pushed her from him : ` There -- get you away now you have said your lesson .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 5]: You need n't whimper .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 13]: We part good friends enough , if that 's the matter . '
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 43]: He remained silent , following her with his eyes , until she had gained her little room and closed the door ; and then turning to the dwarf , said abruptly , ` Harkee , Mr -- ' ` Meaning me ? '
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 4]: returned the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 6]: ` Quilp is my name .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 4]: You might remember .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 11]: It 's not a long one -- Daniel Quilp . '
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 24]: ` Harkee , Mr Quilp , then , ' pursued the other , ` You have some influence with my grandfather there . '
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 9]: ` Some , ' said Mr Quilp emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 14]: ` And are in a few of his mysteries and secrets . ' '
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 11]: A few , ' replied Quilp , with equal dryness .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 57]: ` Then let me tell him once for all , through you , that I will come into and go out of this place as often as I like , so long as he keeps Nell here ; and that if he wants to be quit of me , he must first be quit of her .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 24]: What have I done to be made a bugbear of , and to be shunned and dreaded as if I brought the plague ?
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 31]: He 'll tell you that I have no natural affection ; and that I care no more for Nell , for her own sake , than I do for him .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 5]: Let him say so .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 20]: I care for the whim , then , of coming to and fro and reminding her of my existence .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 8]: I WILL see her when I please .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 5]: That 's my point .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 27]: I came here to-day to maintain it , and I 'll come here again fifty times with the same object and always with the same success .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 11]: I said I would stop till I had gained it .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 12]: I have done so , and now my visit 's ended .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 4]: Come Dick . '
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 4]: ` Stop ! '
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 12]: cried Mr Swiveller , as his companion turned toward the door .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 4]: ` Sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 21]: ` Sir , I am your humble servant , ' said Mr Quilp , to whom the monosyllable was addressed .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 35]: ` Before I leave the gay and festive scene , and halls of dazzling light , sir , ' said Mr Swiveller , ' I will with your permission , attempt a slight remark .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 20]: I came here , sir , this day , under the impression that the old min was friendly . '
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 19]: ` Proceed , sir , ' said Daniel Quilp ; for the orator had made a sudden stop .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 68]: ` Inspired by this idea and the sentiments it awakened , sir , and feeling as a mutual friend that badgering , baiting , and bullying , was not the sort of thing calculated to expand the souls and promote the social harmony of the contending parties , I took upon myself to suggest a course which is THE course to be adopted to the present occasion .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 13]: Will you allow me to whisper half a syllable , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 54]: Without waiting for the permission he sought , Mr Swiveller stepped up to the dwarf , and leaning on his shoulder and stooping down to get at his ear , said in a voice which was perfectly audible to all present , ` The watch-word to the old min is -- fork . '
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 5]: ` Is what ? '
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 3]: demanded Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 16]: ` Is fork , sir , fork , ' replied Mr Swiveller slapping his picket .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 8]: ` You are awake , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 4]: The dwarf nodded .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 22]: Mr Swiveller drew back and nodded likewise , then drew a little further back and nodded again , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 40]: By these means he in time reached the door , where he gave a great cough to attract the dwarf 's attention and gain an opportunity of expressing in dumb show , the closest confidence and most inviolable secrecy .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 28]: Having performed the serious pantomime that was necessary for the due conveyance of these idea , he cast himself upon his friend 's track , and vanished .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 4]: ` Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 21]: said the dwarf with a sour look and a shrug of his shoulders , ` so much for dear relations .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 6]: Thank God I acknowledge none !
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 32]: Nor need you either , ' he added , turning to the old man , ` if you were not as weak as a reed , and nearly as senseless . '
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 9]: ` What would you have me do ? '
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 9]: he retorted in a kind of helpless desperation .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 9]: ` It is easy to talk and sneer .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 8]: What would you have me do ? '
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 13]: ` What would I do if I was in your case ? '
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 4]: said the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 8]: ` Something violent , no doubt . '
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 38]: ` You 're right there , ' returned the little man , highly gratified by the compliment , for such he evidently considered it ; and grinning like a devil as he rubbed his dirty hands together .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 17]: ` Ask Mrs Quilp , pretty Mrs Quilp , obedient , timid , loving Mrs Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 28]: But that reminds me -- I have left her all alone , and she will be anxious and know not a moment 's peace till I return .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 43]: I know she 's always in that condition when I 'm away , thought she does n't dare to say so , unless I lead her on and tell her she may speak freely and I wo n't be angry with her .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 4]: well-trained Mrs Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 74]: The creature appeared quite horrible with his monstrous head and little body , as he rubbed his hands slowly round , and round , and round again -- with something fantastic even in his manner of performing this slight action -- and , dropping his shaggy brows and cocking his chin in the air , glanced upward with a stealthy look of exultation that an imp might have copied and appropriated to himself .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 54]: ` Here , ' he said , putting his hand into his breast and sidling up to the old man as he spoke ; ' I brought it myself for fear of accidents , as , being in gold , it was something large and heavy for Nell to carry in her bag .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 23]: She need be accustomed to such loads betimes thought , neighbor , for she will carry weight when you are dead . '
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 6]: ` Heaven send she may !
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 16]: I hope so , ' said the old man with something like a groan . '
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 5]: ` Hope so ! '
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 27]: echoed the dwarf , approaching close to his ear ; ` neighbour , I would I knew in what good investment all these supplies are sunk .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 14]: But you are a deep man , and keep your secret close . '
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 5]: ` My secret ! '
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 8]: said the other with a haggard look .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 19]: ` Yes , you 're right -- I -- I -- keep it close -- very close . '
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 32]: He said no more , but taking the money turned away with a slow , uncertain step , and pressed his hand upon his head like a weary and dejected man .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 57]: the dwarf watched him sharply , while he passed into the little sitting-room and locked it in an iron safe above the chimney-piece ; and after musing for a short space , prepared to take his leave , observing that unless he made good haste , Mrs Quilp would certainly be in fits on his return .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 48]: ` And so , neighbour , ' he added , ` I 'll turn my face homewards , leaving my love for Nelly and hoping she may never lose her way again , though her doing so HAS procured me an honour I did n't expect . '
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 37]: With that he bowed and leered at me , and with a keen glance around which seemed to comprehend every object within his range of vision , however , small or trivial , went his way .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 23]: I had several times essayed to go myself , but the old man had always opposed it and entreated me to remain .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 53]: As he renewed his entreaties on our being left along , and adverted with many thanks to the former occasion of our being together , I willingly yielded to his persuasions , and sat down , pretending to examine some curious miniatures and a few old medals which he placed before me .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 33]: It needed no great pressing to induce me to stay , for if my curiosity has been excited on the occasion of my first visit , it certainly was not diminished now .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 22]: Nell joined us before long , and bringing some needle-work to the table , sat by the old man 's side .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 45]: It was pleasant to observe the fresh flowers in the room , the pet bird with a green bough shading his little cage , the breath of freshness and youth which seemed to rustle through the old dull house and hover round the child .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 36]: It was curious , but not so pleasant , to turn from the beauty and grace of the girl , to the stooping figure , care-worn face , and jaded aspect of the old man .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 36]: As he grew weaker and more feeble , what would become of this lonely litle creature ; poor protector as he was , say that he died -- what we be her fate , then ?
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 20]: The old man almost answered my thoughts , as he laid his hand on hers , and spoke aloud .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 36]: ` I 'll be of better cheer , Nell , ' he said ; ` there must be good fortune in store for thee -- I do not ask it for myself , but thee .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 29]: Such miseries must fall on thy innocent head without it , that I can not believe but that , being tempted , it will come at last ! '
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 12]: She looked cheerfully into his face , but made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 89]: ` When I think , ' said he , ` of the many years -- many in thy short life -- that thou has lived with me ; of my monotonous existence , knowing no companions of thy own age nor any childish pleasures ; of the solitutde in which thou has grown to be what thou art , and in which thou hast lived apart from nearly all thy kind but one old man ; I sometimes fear I have dealt hardly by thee , Nell . '
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 4]: ` Grandfather ! '
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 7]: cried the child in unfeigned surprise .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 13]: ` Not in intention -- no no , ' said he . '
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 28]: I have ever looked forward to the time that should enable thee to mix among the gayest and prettiest , and take thy station with the best .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 36]: But I still look forward , Nell , I still look forward , and if I should be forced to leave thee , meanwhile , how have I fitted thee for struggles with the world ?
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 22]: The poor bird yonder is as well qualified to encounter it , and be turned adrift upon its mercies -- Hark !
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 5]: I hear Kit outside .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 11]: Go to him , Nell , go to him . '
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 43]: She rose , and hurrying away , stopped , turned back , and put her arms about the old man 's neck , then left him and hurried away again -- but faster this time , to hide her falling tears . '
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 19]: A word in your ear , sir , ' said the old man in a hurried whisper . '
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 52]: I have been rendered uneasy by what you said the other night , and can only plead that I have done all for the best -- that it is too late to retract , if I could -LRB- though I can not -RRB- -- and that I hope to triumph yet .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 6]: All is for her sake .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 19]: I have borne great poverty myself , and would spare her the sufferings that poverty carries with it .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 21]: I would spare her the miseries that brought her mother , my own dear child , to an early grave .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 31]: I would leave her -- not with resources which could be easily spent or squandered away , but with what would place her beyond the reach of want for ever .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 5]: you mark me sir ?
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 12]: She shall have no pittance , but a fortune -- Hush !
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 22]: I can say no more than that , now or at any other time , and she is here again ! '
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 48]: The eagerness with which all this was poured into my ear , the trembling of the hand with which he clasped my arm , the strained and starting eyes he fixed upon me , the wild vehemence and agitation of his manner , filled me with amazement .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 30]: All that I had heard and seen , and a great part of what he had said himself , led me to suppose that he was a wealthy man .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 56]: I could form no comprehension of his character , unless he were one of those miserable wretches who , having made gain the sole end and object of their lives and having succeeded in amassing great riches , are constantly tortured by the dread of poverty , and best by fears of loss and ruin .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 43]: Many things he had said which I had been at a loss to understand , were quite reconcilable with the idea thus presented to me , and at length I concluded that beyond all doubt he was one of this unhappy race .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 71]: The opinion was not the result of hasty consideration , for which indeed there was no opportunity at that time , as the child came directly , and soon occupied herself in preparations for giving Kit a writing lesson , of which it seemed he had a couple every week , and one regularly on that evening , to the great mirth and enjoyment both of himself and his instructress .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 208]: To relate how it was a long time before his modesty could be so far prevailed upon as it admit of his sitting down in the parlour , in the presence of an unknown gentleman -- how , when he did set down , he tucked up his sleeves and squared his elbows and put his face close to the copy-book and squinted horribly at the lines -- how , from the very first moment of having the pen in his hand , he began to wallow in blots , and to daub himself with ink up to the very roots of his hair -- how , if he did by accident form a letter properly , he immediately smeared it out again with his arm in his preparations to make another -- how , at every fresh mistake , there was a fresh burst of merriment from the child and louder and not less hearty laugh from poor Kit himself -- and how there was all the way through , notwithstanding , a gentle wish on her part to teach , and an anxious desire on his to learn -- to relate all these particulars would no doubt occupy more space and time than they deserve .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 57]: It will be sufficient to say that the lesson was given -- that evening passed and night came on -- that the old man again grew restless and impatient -- that he quitted the house secretly at the same hour as before -- and that the child was once more left alone within its gloomy walls .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 55]: And now that I have carried this history so far in my own character and introduced these personages to the reader , I shall for the convenience of the narrative detach myself from its further course , and leave those who have prominent and necessary parts in it to speak and act for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 19]: Chapter 4 Mr and Mrs Quilp resided on Tower Hill ; and in her bower on Tower Hill .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 27]: Mrs Quilp was left to pine the absence of her lord , when he quitted her on the business which he had already seen to transact .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 25]: Mr Quilp could scarcely be said to be of any particular trade or calling , though his pursuits were diversified and his occupations numerous .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 73]: He collected the rents of whole colonies of filthy streets and alleys by the waterside , advanced money to the seamen and petty officers of merchant vessels , had a share in the ventures of divers mates of East Indiamen , smoked his smuggled cigars under the very nose of the Custom House , and made appointments on ` Change with men in glazed hats and round jackets pretty well every day .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 82]: On the Surrey side of the river was a small rat-infested dreary yard called ` Quilp 's Wharf , ' in which were a little wooden counting-house burrowing all awry in the dust as if it had fallen from the clouds and ploughed into the ground ; a few fragments of rusty anchors ; several large iron rings ; some piles of rotten wood ; and two or three heaps of old sheet copper , crumpled , cracked , and battered .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 40]: On Quilp 's Wharf , Daniel Quilp was a ship-breaker , yet to judge from these appearances he must either have been a ship-breaker on a very small scale , or have broken his ships up very small indeed .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 76]: Neither did the place present any extraordinary aspect of life or activity , as its only human occupant was an amphibious boy in a canvas suit , whose sole change of occupation was from sitting on the head of a pile and throwing stones into the mud when the tide was out , to standing with his hands in his pockets gazing listlessly on the motion and on the bustle of the river at high-water .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 52]: The dwarf 's lodging on Tower hill comprised , besides the needful accommodation for himself and Mrs Quilp , a small sleeping-closet for that lady 's mother , who resided with the couple and waged perpetual war with Daniel ; of whom , notwithstanding , she stood in no slight dread .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 52]: Indeed , the ugly creature contrived by some means or other -- whether by his ugliness or his ferocity or his natural cunning is no great matter -- to impress with a wholesome fear of his anger , most of those with whom he was brought into daily contact and communication .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 60]: Over nobody had he such complete ascendance as Mrs Quilp herself -- a pretty little , mild-spoken , blue-eyed woman , who having allied herself in wedlock to the dwarf in one of those strange infatuations of which examples are by no means scarce , performed a sound practical penance for her folly , every day of her life .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 13]: It has been said that Mrs Quilp was pining in her bower .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 62]: In her bower she was , but not alone , for besides the old lady her mother of whom mention has recently been made , there were present some half-dozen ladies of the neighborhood who had happened by a strange accident -LRB- and also by a little understanding among themselves -RRB- to drop in one after another , just about tea-time .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 86]: This being a season favourable to conversation , and the room being a cool , shady , lazy kind of place , with some plants at the open window shutting out the dust , and interposing pleasantly enough between the tea table within and the old Tower without , it is no wonder that the ladies felt an inclination to talk and linger , especially when there are taken into account the additional inducements of fresh butter , new bread , shrimps , and watercresses .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 51]: Now , the ladies being together under these circumstances , it was extremely natural that the discourse should turn upon the propensity of mankind to tyrannize over the weaker sex , and the duty that developed upon the weaker sex to resist that tyranny and assert their rights and dignity .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 124]: It was natural for four reasons : firstly , because Mrs Quilp being a young woman and notoriously under the dominion of her husband ought to be excited to rebel ; secondly , because Mrs Quilp 's parent was known to be laudably shrewish in her disposition and inclined to resist male authority ; thirdly , because each visitor wished to show for herself how superior she was in this respect to the generality of her sex ; and forthly , because the company being accustomed to acandalise each other in pairs , were deprived of their usual subject of conversation now that they were all assembled in close friendship , and had consequently no better employment than to attack the common enemy .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 41]: Moved by these considerations , a stout lady opened the proceedings by inquiring , with an air of great concern and sympathy , how Mr Quilp was ; whereunto Mr Quilp 's wife 's mother replied sharply , ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 23]: He was well enough -- nothing much was every the matter with him -- and ill weeds were sure to thrive . '
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 22]: All the ladies then sighed in concert , shook their heads gravely , and looked at Mrs Quilp as a martyr .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 50]: said the spokeswoman , ' I wish you 'd give her a little of your advice , Mrs Jiniwin ' -- Mrs Quilp had been a Miss Jiniwin it should be observed -- ` nobody knows better than you , ma'am , what us women owe to ourselves . '
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 7]: ` Owe indeed , ma'am ! '
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 4]: replied Mrs Jiniwin .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 68]: ` When my poor husband , her dear father , was alive , if he had ever venture 'd a cross word to me , I 'd have -- ' The good old lady did not finish the sentence , but she twisted off the head of a shrimp with a vindictiveness which seemed to imply that the action was in some degree a substitute for words .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 40]: In this light it was clearly understood by the other party , who immediately replied with great approbation , ` You quite enter into my feelings , ma'am , and it 's jist what I 'd do myself . '
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 15]: ` But you have no call to do it , ' said Mrs Jiniwin .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 18]: ` Luckily for you , you have no more occasion to do it than I had . '
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 19]: ` No woman need have , if she was true to herself , ' rejoined the stout lady .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 9]: ` Do you hear that , Betsy ? '
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 9]: said Mrs Jiniwin , in a warning voice .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 24]: ` How often have I said the same words to you , and almost gone down my knees when I spoke 'em ! '
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 30]: Poor Mrs Quilp , who had looked in a state of helplessness from one face of condolence to another , coloured , smiled , and shook her head doubtfully .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 160]: This was the signal for a general clamour , which beginning in a low murmur gradually swelled into a great noise in which everybody spoke at once , and all said that she being a young woman had no right to set up her opinions against the experiences of those who knew so much better ; that it was very wrong of her not to take the advice of people who had nothing at heart but her good ; that it was next door to being downright ungrateful to conduct herself in that manner ; that if she had no respect for herself she ought to have some for other women , all of whom she compromised by her meekness ; and that if she had no respect for other women , the time would come when other women would have no respect for her ; and she would be very sorry for that , they could tell her .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 63]: Having dealt out these admonitions , the ladies fell to a more powerful assault than they had yet made upon the mixed tea , new bread , fresh butter , shrimps , and watercresses , and said that their vexation was so great to see her going on like that , that they could hardly bring themselves to eat a single morsel .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 44]: It 's all very fine to talk , ' said Mrs Quilp with much simplicity , ` but I know that if I was to die to-morrow , Quilp could marry anybody he pleased -- now that he could , I know ! '
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 11]: There was quite a scream of indignation at this idea .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 5]: Marry whom he pleased !
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 28]: They would like to see him dare to think of marrying any of them ; they would like to see the faintest approach to such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 19]: One lady -LRB- a widow -RRB- was quite certain she should stab him if he hinted at it .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 80]: ` Very well , ' said Mrs Quilp , nodding her head , ` as I said just now , it 's very easy to talk , but I say again that I know -- that I 'm sure -- Quilp has such a way with him when he likes , that the best looking woman here could n't refuse him if I was dead , and she was free , and he chose to make love to him .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 3]: Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 20]: Everybody bridled up at this remark , as much as to say , ' I know you mean me .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 9]: Let him try -- that 's all . '
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 45]: and yet for some hidden reason they were all angry with the widow , and each lady whispered in her neighbour 's ear that it was very plain that said widow thought herself the person referred to , and what a puss she was !
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 28]: ` Mother knows , ' said Mrs Quilp , ` that what I say is quite correct , for she often said so before we were married .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 9]: Did n't you say so , mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 54]: This inquiry involved the respected lady in rather a delicate position , for she certainly had been an active party in making her daughter Mrs Quilp , and , besides , it was not supporting the family credit to encourage the idea that she had married a man whom nobody else would have .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 31]: On the other hand , to exaggerate the captivating qualities of her son-in-law would be to weaken the cause of revolt , in which all her energies were deeply engaged .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 43]: Beset by these opposing considerations , Mrs Jiniwin admitted the powers of insinuation , but denied the right to govern , and with a timely compliment to the stout lady brought back the discussion to the point from which it had strayed .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 17]: It 's a sensible and proper thing indeed , what Mrs George has said , ! '
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 5]: exclaimed the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 9]: ` If women are only true to themselves !
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 15]: -- But Betsy is n't , and more 's the shame and pity . '
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 58]: ` Before I 'd let a man order me about as Quilp orders her , ' said Mrs George , ` before I 'd consent to stand in awe of a man as she does of him , I 'd -- I 'd kill myself , and write a letter first to say he did it ! '
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 71]: This remark being loudly commended and approved of , another lady -LRB- from the Minories -RRB- put in her word : ` Mr Quilp may be a very nice man , ' said this lady , ` and I supposed there 's no doubt he is , because Mrs Quilp says he is , and Mrs Jiniwin says he is , and they ought to know , or nobody does .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 59]: But still he is not quite a -- what one calls a handsome man , nor quite a young man neither , which might be a little excuse for him if anything could be ; whereas his wife is young , and is good-looking , and is a woman -- which is the greatest thing after all . '
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 48]: This last clause being delivered with extraordinary pathos , elicited a corresponding murmer from the hearers , stimulated by which the lady went on to remark that if such a husband was cross and unreasonable with such a wife , then -- ` If he is ! '
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 24]: interposed the mother , putting down her tea-cup and brushing the crumbs out of her lap , preparatory to making a solemn declaration .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 5]: ` If he is !
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 58]: He is the greatest tyrant that every lived , she dare n't call her soul her own , he makes her tremble with a word and even with a look , he frightens her to death , and she has n't the spirit to give him a word back , no , not a single word . '
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 58]: Notwithstanding that the fact had been notorious beforehand to all the tea-drinkers , and had been discussed and expatiated on at every tea-drinking in the neighbourhood for the last twelve months , this official communication was no sooner made than they all began to talk at once and to vie with each other in vehemence and volubility .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 67]: Mrs George remarked that people would talk , that people had often said this to her before , that Mrs Simmons then and there present had told her so twenty times , that she had always said , ` No , Henrietta Simmons , unless I see it with my own eyes and hear it with my own ears , I never will believe it . '
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 13]: Mrs Simmons corroborated this testimony and added strong evidence of her own .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 45]: The lady from the Minories recounted a successful course of treatment under which she had placed her own husband , who , from manifesting one month after marriage unequivocal symptoms of the tiger , had by this means become subdued into a perfect lamb .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 40]: Another lady recounted her own personal struggle and final triumph , in the course whereof she had found it necessary to call in her mother and two aunts , and to weep incessantly night and day for six weeks .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 80]: A third , who in the general confusion could secure no other listener , fastened herself upon a young woman still unmarried who happened to be amongst them , and conjured her , as she valued her own peace of mind and happiness to profit by this solemn occasion , to take example from the weakness of Mrs Quilp , and from that time forth to direct her whole thoughts to taming and subduing the rebellious spirit of man .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 51]: The noise was at its height , and half the company had elevated their voices into a perfect shriek in order to drown the voices of the other half , when Mrs Jiniwin was seen to change colour and shake her forefinger stealthily , as if exhorting them to silence .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 36]: Then , and not until then , Daniel Quilp himself , the cause and occasion of all this clamour , was observed to be in the room , looking on and listening with profound attention .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 13]: ` Go on , ladies , go on , ' said Daniel .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 26]: ` Mrs Quilp , pray ask the ladies to stop to supper , and have a couple of lobsters and something light and palatable . '
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 19]: ` I -- I -- did n't ask them to tea , Quilp , ' stammered his wife .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 7]: It 's quite an accident . '
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 50]: ` So much the better , Mrs Quilp ; these accidental parties are always the pleasantest , ' said the dwarf , rubbing his hands so hard that he seemed to be engaged in manufacturing , of the dirt with which they were encrusted , little charges for popguns .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 13]: Not going , ladies , you are not going , surely ! '
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 43]: His fair enemies tossed their heads slightly as they sought their respective bonnets and shawls , but left all verbal contention to Mrs Jiniwin , who finding herself in the position of champion , made a faint struggle to sustain the character .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 25]: ` And why not stop to supper , Quilp , ' said the old lady , ` if my daughter had a mind ? '
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 9]: ` To be sure , ' rejoined Daniel .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 5]: ` Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 15]: ` There 's nothing dishonest or wrong in a supper , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 4]: said Mrs Jiniwin .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 9]: ` Surely not , ' returned the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 6]: ` Why should there be ?
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 24]: Nor anything unwholesome , either , unless there 's lobster-salad or prawns , which I 'm told are not good for digestion . '
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 26]: ` And you would n't like your wife to be attacked with that , or anything else that would make her uneasy would you ? '
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 4]: said Mrs Jiniwin .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 16]: ` Not for a score of worlds , ' replied the dwarf with a grin .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 23]: ` Not even to have a score of mothers-in-law at the same time -- and what a blessing that would be ! '
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 43]: ` My daughter 's your wife , Mr Quilp , certainly , ' said the old lady with a giggle , meant for satirical and to imply that he needed to be reminded of the fact ; ` your wedded wife . '
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 7]: ` So she is , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 9]: So she is , ' observed the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 39]: ` And she has has a right to do as she likes , I hope , Quilp , ' said the old lady trembling , partly with anger and partly with a secret fear of her impish son-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 6]: ` Hope she has ! '
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 3]: he replied .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 7]: Do n't you know she has ?
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 11]: Do n't you know she has , Mrs Jiniwin ? '
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 23]: I know she ought to have , Quilp , and would have , if she was of my way of thiniking . '
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 17]: ` Why a n't you of your mother 's way of thinking , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 24]: said the dwarf , turing round and addressing his wife , ` why do n't you always imitate your mother , my dear ?
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 18]: She 's the ornament of her sex -- your father said so every day of his life .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 7]: I am sure he did . '
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 31]: ` Her father was a blessed creetur , Quilp , and worthy twenty thousand of some people , ' said Mrs Jiniwin ; ` twenty hundred million thousand . ' '
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 14]: I should like to have known him , ' remarked the dwarf . '
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 18]: I dare say he was a blessed creature then ; but I 'm sure he is now .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 6]: It was a happy release .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 10]: I believe he had suffered a long time ? '
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 32]: The old lady gave a gasp , but nothing came of it ; Quilp resumed , with the same malice in his eye and the same sarcastic politeness on his tongue .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 27]: ` You look ill , Mrs Jiniwin ; I know you have been exciting yourself too much -- talking perhaps , for it is your weakness .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 4]: Go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 7]: Do go to bed . ' '
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 14]: I shall go when I please , Quilp , and not before . '
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 7]: ` But please to do now .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 11]: Do please to go now , ' said the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 44]: The old woman looked angrily at him , but retreated as he advanced , and falling back before him , suffered him to shut the door upon her and bolt her out among the guests , who were by this time crowding downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 44]: Being left along with his wife , who sat trembling in a corner with her eyes fixed upon the ground , the little man planted himself before her , and folding his arms looked steadily at her for a long time without speaking .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 10]: ` Mrs Quilp , ' he said at last .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 10]: ` Yes , Quilp , ' she replead meekly .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 38]: Instead of pursing the theme he had in his mind , Quilp folded his arms again , and looked at her more sternly than before , while she averted her eyes and kept them on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 5]: ` Mrs Quilp . '
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 6]: ` Yes , Quilp . '
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 16]: ` If ever you listen to these beldames again , I 'll bite you . '
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 36]: With this laconic threat , which he accompanied with a snarl that gave him the appearance of being particularly in earnest , Mr Quilp bade her clear the teaboard away , and bring the rum .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 49]: The spirit being set before him in a huge case-bottle , which had originally come out of some ship 's locker , he settled himself in an arm-chair with his large head and face squeezed up against the back , and his little legs planted on the table .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 26]: ` Now , Mrs Quilp , ' he said ; ' I feel in a smoking humour , and shall probably blaze away all night .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 17]: But sit where you are , if you please , in case I want you . '
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 34]: His wife returned no other reply than the necessary ` Yes , Quilp , ' and the small lord of the creation took his first cigar and mixed his first glass of grog .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 94]: The sun went down and the stars peeped out , the Tower turned from its own proper colours to grey and from grey to black , the room became perfectly dark and the end of the cigar a deep fiery red , but still Mr Quilp went on smoking and drinking in the same position , and staring listlessly out of window with the doglike smile always on his face , save when Mrs Quilp made some involuntary movement of restlessness or fatigue ; and then it expanded into a grin of delight .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 64]: Chapter 5 Whether Mr Quilp took any sleep by snatches of a few winks at a time , or whether he sat with his eyes wide open all night long , certain it is that he kept his cigar alight , and kindled every fresh one from the ashes of that which was nearly consumed , without requiring the assistance of a candle .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 81]: Nor did the striking of the clocks , hour after hour , appear to inspire him with any sense of drowsiness or any natural desire to go to rest , but rather to increase his wakefulness , which he showed , at every such indication of the progress of the night , by a suppressed cackling in his throat , and a motion of his shoulders , like one who laughs heartily but the same time slyly and by stealth .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 74]: At length the day broke , and poor Mrs Quilp , shivering with cold of early morning and harassed by fatigue and want of sleep , was discovered sitting patiently on her chair , raising her eyes at intervals in mute appeal to the compassion and clemency of her lord , and gently reminding him by an occasion cough that she was still unpardoned and that her penance had been of long duration .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 55]: But her dwarfish spouse still smoked his cigar and drank his rum without heeding her ; and it was not until the sun had some time risen , and the activity and noise of city day were rife in the street , that he deigned to recognize her presence by any word or sign .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 34]: He might not have done so even then , but for certain impatient tapping at the door he seemed to denote that some pretty hard knuckles were actively engaged upon the other side .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 6]: ` Why dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 14]: he said looking round with a malicious grin , ` it 's day .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 9]: Open the door , sweet Mrs Quilp ! '
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 13]: His obedient wife withdrew the bolt , and her lady mother entered .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 41]: Now , Mrs Jiniwin bounced into the room with great impetuosity ; for , supposing her son-in-law to be still a-bed , she had come to relieve her feelings by pronouncing a strong opinion upon his general conduct and character .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 35]: Seeing that he was up and dressed , and that the room appeared to have been occupied ever since she quitted it on the previous evening , she stopped short , in some embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 47]: Nothing escaped the hawk 's eye of the ugly little man , who , perfectly understanding what passed in the old lady 's mind , turned uglier still in the fulness of his satisfaction , and bade her good morning , with a leer or triumph .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 36]: ` Why , Betsy , ' said the old woman , ` you have n't been -- you do n't mean to say you 've been a -- ' ` Sitting up all night ? '
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 10]: said Quilp , supplying the conclusion of the sentence .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 6]: ` Yes she has ! '
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 5]: ` All night ? '
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 4]: cried Mrs Jiniwin .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 6]: ` Ay , all night .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 8]: Is the dear old lady deaf ? '
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 13]: said Quilp , with a smile of which a frown was part .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 10]: ` Who says man and wife are bad company ?
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 3]: Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 6]: The time has flown . '
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 7]: ` You 're a brute ! '
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs Jiniwin .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 23]: ` Come come , ' said Quilp , wilfully misunderstanding her , of course , ` you must n't call her names .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 8]: She 's married now , you know .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 32]: And though she did beguile the time and keep me from my bed , you must not be so tenderly careful of me as to be out of humour with her .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 8]: Bless you for a dear old lady .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 8]: Here 's to your health ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 33]: I am much obliged to you , ' returned the old woman , testifying by a certain restlessness in her hands a vehement desire to shake her matronly fist at her son-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 9]: I 'm very much obliged to you ! '
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 5]: ` Grateful soul ! '
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 4]: cried the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 5]: ` Mrs Quilp . '
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 11]: ` Yes , Quilp , ' said the timid sufferer .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 11]: ` Help your mother to get breakfast , Mrs Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 19]: I am going to the wharf this morning -- the earlier the better , so be quick . '
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 31]: Mrs Jiniwin made a faint demonstration of rebellion by sitting down in a chair near the door and folding her arms as if in a resolute determination to do nothing .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 53]: But a few whispered words from her daughter , and a kind inquiry from her son-in-law whether she felt faint , with a hint that there was abundance of cold water in the next apartment , routed these symptoms effectually , and she applied herself to the prescribed preparations with sullen diligence .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 47]: While they were in progress , Mr Quilp withdrew to the adjoining room , and , turning back his coat-collar , proceeded to smear his countenance with a damp towel of very unwholesome appearance , which made his complexion rather more cloudy than it was before .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 57]: But , while he was thus engaged , his caution and inquisitiveness did not forsake him , for with a face as sharp and cunning as ever , he often stopped , even in this short process , and stood listening for any conversation in the next room , of which he might be the theme .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 25]: he said after a short effort of attention , ` it was not the towel over my ears , I thought it was n't .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 16]: I 'm a little hunchy villain and a monster , am I , Mrs Jiniwin ?
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 3]: Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 15]: The pleasure of this discovery called up the old doglike smile in full force .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 22]: When he had quite done with it , he shook himself in a very doglike manner , and rejoined the ladies .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 45]: Mr Quilp now walked up to front of a looking-glass , and was standing there putting on his neckerchief , when Mrs Jiniwin happening to be behind him , could not resist the inclination she felt to shake her fist at her tyrant son-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 37]: It was the gesture of an instant , but as she did so and accompanied the action with a menacing look , she met his eye in the glass , catching her in the very act .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 49]: The same glance at the mirror conveyed to her the reflection of a horribly grotesque and distorted face with the tongue lolling out ; and the next instant the dwarf , turning about with a perfectly bland and placid look , inquired in a tone of great affection .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 12]: ` How are you now , my dear old darling ? '
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 55]: Slight and ridiculous as the incident was , it made him appear such a little fiend , and withal such a keen and knowing one , that the old woman felt too much afraid of him to utter a single word , and suffered herself to be led with extraordinary politeness to the breakfast-table .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 95]: Here he by no means diminished the impression he had just produced , for he ate hard eggs , shell and all , devoured gigantic prawns with the heads and tails on , chewed tobacco and water-cresses at the same time and with extraordinary greediness , drank boiling tea without winking , bit his fork and spoon till they bent again , and in short performed so many horrifying and uncommon acts that the women were nearly frightened out of their wits , and began to doubt if he were really a human creature .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 56]: At last , having gone through these proceedings and many others which were equally a part of his system , Mr Quilp left them , reduced to a very obedient and humbled state , and betook himself to the river-side , where he took boat for the wharf on which he had bestowed his name .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 20]: It was flood tide when Daniel Quilp sat himself down in the ferry to cross to the opposite shore .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 91]: A fleet of barges were coming lazily on , some sideways , some head first , some stern first ; all in a wrong-headed , dogged , obstinate way , bumping up against the larger craft , running under the bows of steamboats , getting into every kind of nook and corner where they had no business , and being crunched on all sides like so many walnut-shells ; while each with its pair of long sweeps struggling and splashing in the water looked like some lumbering fish in pain .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 70]: In some of the vessels at anchor all hands were busily engaged in coiling ropes , spreading out sails to dry , taking in or discharging their cargoes ; in others no life was visible but two or three tarry boys , and perhaps a barking dog running to and fro upon the deck or scrambling up to look over the side and bark the louder for the view .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 49]: Coming slowly on through the forests of masts was a great steamship , beating the water in short impatient strokes with her heavy paddles as though she wanted room to breathe , and advancing in her huge bulk like a sea monster among the minnows of the Thames .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 37]: On either hand were long black tiers of colliers ; between them vessels slowly working out of harbour with sails glistening in the sun , and creaking noise on board , re-echoed from a hundred quarters .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 53]: The water and all upon it was in active motion , dancing and buoyant and bubbling up ; while the old grey Tower and piles of building on the shore , with many a church-spire shooting up between , looked coldly on , and seemed to disdain their chafing , restless neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 74]: Daniel Quilp , who was not much affected by a bright morning save in so far as it spared him the trouble of carrying an umbrella , caused himself to be put ashore hard by the wharf , and proceeded thither through a narrow lane which , partaking of the amphibious character of its frequenters , had as much water as mud in its composition , and a very liberal supply of both .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 72]: Arrived at his destination , the first object that presented itself to his view was a pair of very imperfectly shod feet elevated in the air with the soles upwards , which remarkable appearance was referable to the boy , who being of an eccentric spirit and having a natural taste for tumbling , was now standing on his head and contemplating the aspect of the river under these uncommon circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 49]: He was speedily brought on his heels by the sound of his master 's voice , and as soon as his head was in its right position , Mr Quilp , to speak expresively in the absence of a better verb , ` punched it ' for him .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 23]: ` Come , you let me alone , ' said the boy , parrying Quilp 's hand with both his elbows alternatively .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 20]: ` You 'll get something you wo n't like if you do n't and so I tell you . '
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 43]: ` You dog , ' snarled Quilp , ` I 'll beat you with an iron rod , I 'll scratch you with a rusty nail , I 'll pinch your eyes , if you talk to me -- I will . '
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 39]: With these threats he clenched his hand again , and dexterously diving in betwen the elbows and catching the boy 's head as it dodged from side to side , gave it three or four good hard knocks .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 14]: Having now carried his point and insisted on it , he left off .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 46]: ` You wo n't do it agin , ' said the boy , nodding his head and drawing back , with the elbows ready in case of the worst ; ` now -- ' ` Stand still , you dog , ' said Quilp . '
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 18]: I wo n't do it again , because I 've done it as often as I want .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 2]: Here .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 5]: Take the key . '
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 12]: ` Why do n't you hit one of your size ? '
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 7]: said the boy approaching very slowly .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 13]: ` Where is there one of my size , you dog ? '
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 3]: returned Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 28]: ` Take the key , or I 'll brain you with it ' -- indeed he gave him a smart tap with the handle as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 8]: ` Now , open the counting-house . '
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 27]: The boy sulkily complied , muttering at first , but desisting when he looked round and saw that Quilp was following him with a steady look .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 23]: And here it may be remarked , that between this boy and the dwarf that existed a strange kind of mutual liking .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 30]: How born or bred , and or nourished upon blows and threats on one side , and retorts and defiances on the other , is not to the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 44]: Quilp would certainly suffer nobody to contract him but the boy , and the boy would assuredly not have submitted to be so knocked about by anybody but Quilp , when he had the power to run away at any time he chose .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 19]: ` Now , ' said Quilp , passing into the wooden counting-house , ` you mind the wharf .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 17]: Stand upon your head agin , and I 'll cut one of your feet off . '
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 48]: The boy made no answer , but directly Quilp had shut himself in , stood on his head before the door , then walked on his hands to the back and stood on his head there , and then to the opposite side and repeated the performance .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 31]: There were indeed four sides to the counting-house , but he avoided that one where the window was , deeming it probable that Quilp would be looking out of it .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 57]: This was prudent , for in point of fact , the dwarf , knowing his disposition , was lying in wait at a little distance from the sash armed with a large piece of wood , which , being rough and jagged and studded in many parts with broken nails , might possibly have hurt him .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 70]: It was a dirty little box , this counting-house , with nothing in it but an old ricketty desk and two stools , a hat-peg , an ancient almanack , an inkstand with no ink , and the stump of one pen , and an eight-day clock which had n't gone for eighteen years at least , and of which the minute-hand had been twisted off for a tooth-pick .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 62]: Daniel Quilp pulled his hat over his brows , climbed on to the desk -LRB- which had a flat top -RRB- and stretching his short length upon it went to sleep with ease of an old pactitioner ; intending , no doubt , to compensate himself for the deprivation of last night 's rest , by a long and sound nap .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 44]: Sound it might have been , but long it was not , for he had not been asleep a quarter of an hour when the boy opened the door and thrust in his head , which was like a bundle of badly-picked oakum .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 10]: Quilp was a light sleeper and started up directly .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 12]: ` Here 's somebody for you , ' said the boy .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 5]: ` Who ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 6]: I do n't know . '
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 4]: ` Ask ! '
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 36]: said Quilp , seizing the trifle of wood before mentioned and throwing it at him with such dexterity that it was well the boy disappeared before it reached the spot on which he had stood .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 7]: ` Ask , you dog . '
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 33]: Not caring to venture within range of such missles again , the boy discreetly sent in his stead the first cause of the interruption , who now presented herself at the door .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 6]: ` What , Nelly ! '
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 3]: cried Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 51]: ` Yes , ' said the child , hesitating whether to enter or retreat , for the dwarf just roused , with his dishevelled hair hanging all about him and a yellow handkerchief over his head , was something fearful to behold ; it 's only me , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 14]: ` Come in , ' said Quilp , without getting off the desk .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 4]: ` Come in .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 2]: Stay .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 20]: Just look out into the yard , and see whether there 's a boy standing on his head . '
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 9]: ` No , sir , ' replied Nell .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 8]: ` He 's on his feet . '
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 8]: ` You 're sure he is ? '
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 3]: said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 3]: ` Well .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 9]: Now , come in and shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 8]: What 's your message , Nelly ? '
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 7]: The child handed him a letter .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 35]: Mr Quilp , without changing his position further than to turn over a little more on his side and rest his chin on his hand , proceeded to make himself acquainted with its contents .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 56]: Chapter 6 Little Nell stood timidly by , with her eyes raised to the countenance of Mr Quilp as he read the letter , plainly showing by her looks that while she entertained some fear and distrust of the little man , she was much inclined to laugh at his uncouth appearance and grotesque attitude .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 56]: And yet there was visible on the part of the child a painful anxiety for his reply , and consciousness of his power to render it disagreeable or distressing , which was strongly at variance with this impulse and restrained it more effectually than she could possibly have done by any efforts of her own .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 25]: That Mr Quilp was himself perplexed , and that in no small degree , by the contents of the letter , was sufficiently obvious .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 61]: Before he had got through the first two or three lines he began to open his eyes very wide and to frown most horribly , the next two or three caused him to scratch his head in an uncommonly vicious manner , and when he came to the conclusion he gave a long dismal whistle indicative of surprise and dismay .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 33]: After folding and laying it down beside him , he bit the nails of all of his ten fingers with extreme voracity ; and taking it up sharply , read it again .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 51]: The second perusal was to all appearance as unsatisfactory as the first , and plunged him into a profound reverie from which he awakened to another assault upon his nails and a long stare at the child , who with her eyes turned towards the ground awaited his further pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 5]: ` Halloa here ! '
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 31]: he said at length , in a voice , and with a suddenness , which made the child start as though a gun had been fired off at her ear .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 4]: ` Nelly ! '
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 6]: ` Yes , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 13]: ` Do you know what 's inside this letter , Nell ? '
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 6]: ` No , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 16]: ` Are you sure , quite sure , quite certain , upon your soul ? '
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 7]: ` Quite sure , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 15]: ` Do you wish you may die if you do know , hey ? '
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 4]: said the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 12]: ` Indeed I do n't know , ' returned the child .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 10]: muttered Quilp as he marked her earnest look . '
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 4]: I believe you .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 2]: Humph !
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 3]: Gone already ?
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 5]: Gone in four-and-twenty hours !
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 15]: What the devil has he done with it , that 's the mystery ! '
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 14]: This reflection set him scratching his head and biting his nails once more .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 53]: While he was thus employed his features gradually relaxed into what was with him a cheerful smile , but which in any other man would have been a ghastly grin of pain , and when the child looked up again she found that he was regarding her with extraordinary favour and complacency .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 12]: ` You look very pretty to-day , Nelly , charmingly pretty .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 7]: Are you tired , Nelly ? '
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 5]: ` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 20]: I 'm in a hurry to get back , for he will be anxious while I am away . '
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 18]: ` There 's no hurry , little Nell , no hurry at all , ' said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 14]: ` How should you like to be my number two , Nelly ? '
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 8]: ` To be what , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 19]: ` My number two , Nelly , my second , my Mrs Quilp , ' said the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 25]: The child looked frightened , but seemed not to understand him , which Mr Quilp observing , hastened to make his meaning more distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 50]: ` To be Mrs Quilp the second , when Mrs Quilp the first is dead , sweet Nell , ' said Quilp , wrinkling up his eyes and luring her towards him with his bent forefinger , ` to be my wife , my little cherry-cheeked , red-lipped wife .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 22]: Say that Mrs Quilp lives five year , or only four , you 'll be just the proper age for me .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 3]: Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 32]: Be a good girl , Nelly , a very good girl , and see if one of these days you do n't come to be Mrs Quilp of Tower Hill . '
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 25]: So far from being sustained and stimulated by this delightful prospect , the child shrank from him in great agitation , and trembled violently .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 74]: Mr Quilp , either because frightening anybody afforded him a constitutional delight , or because it was pleasant to contemplate the death of Mrs Quilp number one , and the elevation of Mrs Quilp number two to her post and title , or because he was determined from purposes of his own to be agreeable and good-humoured at that particular time , only laughed and feigned to take no heed of her alarm .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 23]: ` You shall home with me to Tower Hill and see Mrs Quilp that is , directly , ' said the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 18]: ` She 's very fond of you , Nell , though not so fond as I am .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 9]: You shall come home with me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 11]: I must go back indeed , ' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 13]: ` He told me to return directly I had the answer . '
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 48]: ` But you have n't it , Nelly , ' retorted the dwarf , ` and wo n't have it , and ca n't have it , until I have been home , so you see that to do your errand , you must go with me .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 15]: Reach me yonder hat , my dear , and we 'll go directly . '
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 84]: With that , Mr Quilp suffered himself to roll gradually off the desk until his short legs touched the ground , when he got upon them and led the way from the counting-house to the wharf outside , when the first objects that presented themselves were the boy who had stood on his head and another young gentleman of about his own stature , rolling in the mud together , locked in a tight embrace , and cuffing each other with mutual heartiness .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 6]: ` It 's Kit ! '
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 15]: cried Nelly , clasping her hand , ` poor Kit who came with me !
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 10]: Oh , pray stop them , Mr Quilp ! '
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 28]: ` I 'll stop 'em , ' cried Quilp , diving into the little counting-house and returning with a thick stick , ` I 'll stop 'em .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 8]: Now , my boys , fight away .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 6]: I 'll fight you both .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 14]: I 'll take bot of you , both together , both together ! '
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 68]: With which defiances the dwarf flourished his cudgel , and dancing round the combatants and treading upon them and skipping over them , in a kind of frenzy , laid about him , now on one and now on the other , in a most desperate manner , always aiming at their heads and dealing such blows as none but the veriest little savage would have inflicted .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 28]: This being warmer work than they had calculated upon , speedily cooled the courage of the belligerents , who scrambled to their feet and called for quarter .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 29]: ` I 'll beat you to a pulp , you dogs , ' said Quilp , vainly endeavoring to get near either of them for a parting blow .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 28]: ` I 'll bruise you until you 're copper-coloured , I 'll break your faces till you have n't a profile between you , I will . '
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 38]: ` Come , you drop that stick or it 'll be worse for you , ' said his boy , dodging round him and watching an opportunity to rush in ; ` you drop that stick . '
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 35]: ` Come a little nearer , and I 'll drop it on your skull , you dog , ' said Quilp , with gleaming eyes ; ' a little nearer -- nearer yet . '
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 33]: But the boy declined the invitation until his master was apparently a little off his guard , when he darted in and seizing the weapon tried to wrest it from his grasp .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 47]: Quilp , who was as strong as a lion , easily kept his hold until the boy was tugging at it with his utmost power , when he suddenly let it go and sent him reeling backwards , so that he fell violently upon his head .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 26]: the success of this manoeuvre tickled Mr Quilp beyond description , and he laughed and stamped upon the ground as at a most irresistible jest .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 53]: ` Never mind , ' said the boy , nodding his head and rubbing it at the same time ; ` you see if ever I offer to strike anybody again because they say you 're an uglier dwarf than can be seen anywheres for a penny , that 's all . '
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 15]: ` Do you mean to say , I 'm not , you dog ? '
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 3]: returned Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 4]: retorted the boy .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 15]: ` Then what do you fight on my wharf for , you villain ? '
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 3]: said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 23]: ` Because he said so , ' replied to boy , pointing to Kit , ` not because you a n't . '
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 33]: ` Then why did he say , ' bawled Kit , ` that Miss Nelly was ugly , and that she and my master was obliged to do whatever his master liked ?
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 7]: Why did he say that ? '
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 43]: ` He said what he did because he 's a fool , and you said what you did because you 're very wise and clever -- almost too clever to live , unless you 're very careful of yourself , Kit . '
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 22]: said Quilp , with great suavity in his manner , but still more of quiet malice about his eyes and mouth .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 9]: ` Here 's sixpence for you , Kit .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 5]: Always speak the truth .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 10]: At all times , Kit , speak the truth .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 14]: Lock the counting-house , you dog , and bring me the key . '
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 48]: The other boy , to whom this order was addresed , did as he was told , and was rewarded for his partizanship in behalf of his master , by a dexterous rap on the nose with the key , which brought the water into his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 42]: Then Mr Quilp departed with the child and Kit in a boat , and the boy revenged himself by dancing on his head at intervals on the extreme verge of the wharf , during the whole time they crossed the river .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 36]: There was only Mrs Quilp at home , and she , little expecting the return of her lord , was just composing herself for a refreshing slumber when the sound of his footsteps roused her .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 27]: She had barely time to seem to be occupied in some needle-work , when he entered , accompanied by the child ; having left Kit downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 16]: ` Here 's Nelly Trent , dear Mrs Quilp , ' said her husband . '
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 20]: A glass of wine , my dear , and a biscuit , for she has had a long walk .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 16]: She 'll sit with you , my soul , while I write a letter . '
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 36]: Mrs Quilp looked tremblingly in her spouse 's face to know what this unusual courtesy might portend , and obedient to the summons she saw in his gesture , followed him into the next room .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 12]: ` Mind what I say to you , ' whispered Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 30]: ` See if you can get out of her anything about her grandfather , or what they do , or how they live , or what he tells her .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 11]: I 've my reasons for knowing , if I can .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 30]: You women talk more freely to one another than you do to us , and you have a soft , mild way with you that 'll win upon her .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 5]: Do you hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 6]: ` Yes , Quilp . '
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 4]: ` Go then .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 7]: What 's the matter now ? '
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 10]: ` Dear Quilp , ' faltered his wife . '
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 40]: I love the child -- if you could do without making me deceive her -- ' The dwarf muttering a terrible oath looked round as if for some weapon with which to inflict condign punishment upon his disobedient wife .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 21]: the submissive little woman hurriedly entreated him not to be angry , and promised to do as he bade her .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 28]: ` Do you hear me , ' whispered Quilp , nipping and pinching her arm ; ` worm yourself into her secrets ; I know you can .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 6]: I 'm listening , recollect .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 25]: If you 're not sharp enough , I 'll creak the door , and woe betide you if I have to creak it much .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 3]: Go ! '
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 40]: Mrs Quilp departed according to order , and her amiable husband , ensconcing himself behind the partly opened door , and applying his ear close to it , began to listen with a face of great craftiness and attention .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 54]: Poor Mrs Quilp was thinking , however , in what manner to begin or what kind of inquiries she could make ; and it was not until the door , creaking in a very urgent manner , warned her to proceed without further consideration , that the sound of her voice was heard .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 20]: ` How very often you have come backwards and forwards lately to Mr Quilp , my dear . ' '
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 16]: I have said so to grandfather , a hundred times , ' returned Nell innocently .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 10]: ` And what has he said to that ? '
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 43]: ` Only sighed , and dropped his head , and seemed so sad and wretched that if you could have seen him I am sure you must have cried ; you could not have helped it more than I , I know .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 6]: How that door creaks ! '
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 6]: ` It often does . '
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 11]: returned Mrs Quilp , with an uneasy glance towards it .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 14]: ` But your grandfather -- he used not to be so wretched ? '
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 6]: ` Oh , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 9]: said the child eagerly , ` so different !
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 12]: We were once so happy and he so cheerful and contented !
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 16]: You can not think what a sad change has fallen on us since . ' '
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 18]: I am very , very sorry , to hear you speak like this , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 4]: said Mrs Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 6]: And she spoke the truth .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 31]: ` Thank you , ' returned the child , kissing her cheek , ` you are always kind to me , and it is a pleasure to talk to you .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 14]: I can speak to no one else about him , but poor Kit .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 33]: I am very happy still , I ought to feel happier perhaps than I do , but you can not think how it grieves me sometimes to see him alter so . '
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 22]: ` He 'll alter again , Nelly , ' said Mrs Quilp , ` and be what he was before . '
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 13]: ` Oh , if God would only let that come about ! '
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 31]: said the child with streaming eyes ; ` but it is a long time now , since he first began to -- I thought I saw that door moving ! '
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 13]: ` It 's the wind , ' said Mrs Quilp , fainly .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 35]: ` Began to -- -- ' ` To be so thoughtful and dejected , and to forget our old way of spending the time in the long evenings , ' said the child . '
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 49]: I used to read to him by the fireside , and he sat listening , and when I stopped and we began to talk , he told me about my mother , and how she once looked and spoke just like me when she was a little child .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 50]: Then he used to take me on his knee , and try to make me understand that she was not lying in her grave , but had flown to a beautiful country beyond the sky where nothing died or ever grew old -- we were very happy once ! '
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 6]: ` Nelly , Nelly ! '
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 20]: said the poor woman , ' I ca n't bear to see one as young as you so sorrowful .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 7]: Pray do n't cry . ' '
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 47]: I do so very seldom , ' said Nell , ' but I have kept this to myself a long time , and I am not quite well , I think , for the tears come into my eyes and I can not keep them back .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 23]: I do n't mind telling you my grief , for I know you will not tell it to any one again . '
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 11]: Mrs Quilp turned away her head and made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 46]: ` Then , ' said the child , ` we often walked in the fields and among the green trees , and when we came home at night , we liked it better for being tired , and said what a happy place it was .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 42]: And if it was dark and rather dull , we used to say , what did it matter to us , for it only made us remember our last walk with greater pleasure , and look forward to our next one .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 31]: But now we never have these walks , and though it is the same house it is darker and much more gloomy than it used to be , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 18]: She paused here , but though the door creaked more than once , Mrs Quilp said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 25]: ` Mind you do n't suppose , ' said the child earnestly , ` that grandfather is less kind to me than he was .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 22]: I think he loves me better every day , and is kinder and more afectionate than he was the day before .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 13]: You do not know how fond he is of me ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 13]: I am sure he loves you dearly , ' said Mrs Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 8]: ` Indeed , indeed he does ! '
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 11]: cried Nell , ` as dearly as I love him .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 23]: But I have not told you the greatest change of all , and this you must never breathe again to any one .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 34]: He has no sleep or rest , but that which he takes by day in his easy chair ; for every night and neary all night long he is away from home . '
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 4]: ` Nelly ! '
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 14]: said the child , laying her finger on her lip and looking round .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 21]: ` When he comes home in the morning , which is generally just before day , I let him in .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 13]: Last night he was very late , and it was quite light .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 24]: I saw that his face was deadly pale , that his eyes were bloodshot , and that his legs trembled as he walked .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 13]: When I had gone to bed again , I heard him groan .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 46]: I got up and ran back to him , and heard him say , before he knew that I was there , that he could not bear his life much longer , and if it was not for the child , would wish to die .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 5]: What shall I do !
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 6]: What shall I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 61]: The fountains of her heart were opened ; the child , overpowered by the weight of her sorrows and anxieties , by the first confidence she had ever shown , and the sympathy with which her little tale had been received , hid her face in the arms of her helpless friend , and burst into a passion of tears .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 54]: In a few minutes Mr Quilp returned , and expressed the utmost surprise to find her in this condtiion , which he did very naturally and with admirable effect , for that kind of acting had been rendered familiar to him by long practice , and he was quite at home in it .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 31]: ` She 's tired you see , Mrs Quilp , ' said the dwarf , squinting in a hideous manner to imply that his wife was to follow his lead .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 35]: ` It 's a long way from her home to the wharf , and then she was alrmed to see a couple of young scoundrels fighting , and was timorous on the water besides .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 10]: All this together has been too much for her .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 4]: Poor Nell ! '
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 27]: Mr Quilp unintentionally adopted the very best means he could have devised for the recovery of his young visitor , by patting her on the head .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 48]: Such an application from any other hand might not have produced a remarkable effect , but the child shrank so quickly from his touch and felt such an instinctive desire to get out of his reach , that she rose directly and declared herself ready to return .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 16]: ` But you 'd better wait , and dine with Mrs Quilp and me . '
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 5]: said the dwarf . '
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 19]: I have been away too long , sir , already , ' returned Nell , drying her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 19]: ` Well , ' said Mr Quilp , ` if you will go , you will , Nelly .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 5]: Here 's the note .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 30]: It 's only to say that I shall see him to-morrow or maybe next day , and that I could n't do that little business for him this morning .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 4]: Good-bye , Nelly .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 14]: Here , you sir ; take care of her , d'ye hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 85]: Kit , who appeared at the summons , deigned to make no reply to so needless an injunction , and after staring at Quilp in a threatening manner , as if he doubted whether he might not have been the cause of Nelly shedding tears , and felt more than half disposed to revenge the fact upon him on the mere suspicion , turned about and followed his young mistress , who had by this time taken her leave of Mrs Quilp and departed .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 15]: ` You 're a keen questioner , a n't you , Mrs Quilp ? '
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 15]: said the dwarf , turning upon her as soon as they were left alone .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 8]: ` What more could I do ? '
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 5]: returned his wife mildly ?
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 8]: ` What more could you do ! '
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 12]: sneered Quilp , ` could n't you have done something less ?
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 26]: Could n't you have done what you had to do , without appearing in your favourite part of the crocodile , you minx ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 15]: I am very sorry for the child , Quilp , ' said his wife .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 7]: ` Surely I 've done enough .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 25]: I 've led her on to tell her secret she supposed we were alone ; and you were by , God forgive me . '
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 6]: ` You led her on !
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 8]: You did a great deal truly ! '
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 3]: said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 13]: ` What did I tell you about making me creak the door ?
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 41]: It 's lucky for you that from what she let fall , I 've got the clue I want , for if I had n't , I 'd have visited the failure upon you , I can tell you . '
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 12]: Mrs Quilp being fully persuaded of this , made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 46]: Her husband added with some exultation , ` But you may thank your fortunate stars -- the same stars that made you Mrs Quilp -- you may thank them that I 'm upon the old gentleman 's track , and have got a new light .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 36]: So let me hear no more about this matter now or at any other time , and do n't get anything too nice for dinner , for I sha n't be home to it . '
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 100]: So saying , Mr Quilp put his hat on and took himself off , and Mrs Quilp , who was afflicted beyond measure by the recollection of the part she had just acted , shut herself up in her chamber , and smothering her head in the bed-clothes bemoaned her fault more bitterly than many less tender-hearted persons would have mourned a much greater offence ; for , in the majority of cases , conscience is an elastic and very flexible article , which will bear a deal of stretching and adapt itself to a great variety of circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 66]: Some people by prudent management and leaving it off piece by piece like a flannel waistcoat in warm weather , even contrive , in time , to dispense with it altogether ; but there be others who can assume the garment and throw it off at pleasure ; and this , being the greatest and most convenient improvement , is the one most in vogue .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 40]: Chapter 7 ` Fred , ' said Mr Swiveller , ` remember the once popular melody of Begone dull care ; fan the sinking flame of hilarity with the wing of friendship ; and pass the rosy wine . '
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 65]: Mr Richard Swiveller 's apartments were in the neighbourhood of Drury Lane , and in addition to this convenience of situation had the advantage of being over a tobacconist 's shop , so that he was enabled to procure a refreshing sneeze at any time by merely stepping out upon the staircase , and was saved the trouble and expense of maintaining a snuff-box .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 119]: It was in these apartments that Mr Swiveller made use of the expressions above recorded for the consolation and encouragement of his desponding friend ; and it may not be uninteresting or improper to remark that even these brief observations partook in a double sense of the figurative and poetical character of Mr Swiveller 's mind , as the rosy wine was in fact represented by one glass of cold gin-and-water , which was replenished as occasion required from a bottle and jug upon the table , and was passed from one to another , in a scarcity of tumblers which , as Mr Swiveller 's was a bachelor 's establishment , may be acknowledged without a blush .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 16]: By a like pleasant fiction his single chamber was always mentioned in a plural number .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 74]: In its disengaged times , the tobacconist had announced it in his window as ` apartments ' for a single gentleman , and Mr Swiveller , following up the hint , never failed to speak of it as his rooms , his lodgings , or his chambers , conveying to his hearers a notion of indefinite space , and leaving their imaginations to wander through long suites of lofty halls , at pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 45]: In this flight of fancy , Mr Swiveller was assisted by a deceptive piece of furniture , in reality a bedstead , but in semblance a bookcase , which occupied a prominent situation in his chamber and seemed to defy suspicion and challenge inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 47]: There is no doubt that by day Mr Swiveller firmly believed this secret convenience to be a bookcase and nothing more ; that he closed his eyes to the bed , resolutely denied the existence of the blankets , and spurned the bolster from his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 32]: No word of its real use , no hint of its nightly service , no allusion to its peculiar properties , had ever passed between him and his most intimate friends .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 13]: Implicit faith in the deception was the first article of his creed .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 30]: To be the friend of Swiveller you must reject all circumstantial evidence , all reason , observation , and experience , and repose a blind belief in the bookcase .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 11]: It was his pet weakness , and he cherished it .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 4]: ` Fred ! '
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 16]: said Mr Swiveller , finding that his former adjuration had been productive of no effect .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 6]: ` Pass the rosy . '
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 28]: Young Trent with an impatient gesture pushed the glass towards him , and fell again in the the moddy attitude from which he had been unwillingly roused .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 26]: ` I 'll give you , Fred , ' said his friend , stirring the mixture , ' a little sentiment appropriate to the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 11]: Here 's May the -- -- ' ` Pshaw ! '
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 4]: interposed the other .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 10]: ` You worry me to death with your chattering .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 9]: You can be merry under any circumstances . '
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 23]: ` Why , Mr Trent , ' returned Dick , ` there is a proverb which talks about being merry and wise .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 32]: There are some people who can be merry and ca n't be wise , and some who can be wise -LRB- or think they can -RRB- and ca n't be merry .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 8]: I 'm one of the first sort .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 48]: If the proverb 's a good ` un , I supose it 's better to keep to half of it than none ; at all events , I 'd rather be merry and not wise , than like you , neither one nor t ` other . '
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 4]: ` Bah ! '
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 6]: muttered his friend , peevishly .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 11]: ` With all my heart , ' said Mr Swiveller .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 28]: ` In the polite circles I believe this sort of thing is n't usually said to a gentleman in his own apartments , but never mind that .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 64]: Make yourself at home , ' adding to this retort an observation to the effect that his friend appeared to be rather ` cranky ' in point of temper , Richards Swiveller finished the rosy and applied himself to the composition of another glassful , in which , after tasting it with great relish , he proposed a toast to an imaginary company .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 55]: ` Gentlemen , I 'll give you , if you please , Success to the ancient family of the Swivellers , and good luck to Mr Richard in particular -- Mr Richard , gentlemen , ' said Dick with great emphasis , ` who spends all his money on his friends and is Bah !
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 5]: 'd for his pains .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 5]: Hear , hear ! '
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 4]: ` Dick ! '
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 42]: said the other , returning to his seat after having paced the room twice or thrice , ` will you talk seriously for two minutes , if I show you a way to make your fortune with very little trouble ? '
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 59]: ` You 've shown me so many , ' returned Dick ; ` and nothing has come of any one of 'em but empty pockets -- -- ' ` You 'll tell a different story of this one , before a very long time is over , ' said his companion , drawing his chair to the table .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 8]: ` You saw my sister Nell ? '
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 6]: ` What about her ? '
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 3]: returned Dick .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 12]: ` She has a pretty face , has she not ? '
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 10]: ` Why , certainly , ' replied Dick . '
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 20]: I must say for her that there 's not any very strong family likeness between her and you . '
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 13]: ` Has she a pretty face , ' repeated his friend impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 19]: ` Yes , ' said Dick , ` she has a pretty face , a very pretty face .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 5]: What of that ? '
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 11]: ` I 'll tell you , ' returned his friend .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 33]: ` It 's very plain that the old man and I will remain at daggers drawn to the end of our lives , and that I have nothing to expect from him .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 9]: You see that , I suppose ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 15]: A bat might see that , with the sun shining , ' said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 42]: ` It 's equally plain that the money which the old flint -- rot him -- first taught me to expect that I should share with her at his death , will all be hers , is it not ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 27]: I should said it was , ' replied Dick ; ` unless the way in which I put the case to him , made an impression .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 6]: It may have done so .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 6]: It was powerful , Fred .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 21]: ` Here is a jolly old grandfather ' -- that was strong , I thought -- very friendly and natural .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 9]: Did it strike you in that way ? '
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 19]: It did n't strike him , ' returned the other , ` so we need n't discuss it .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 4]: Now look here .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 6]: Nell is nearly fourteen . '
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 16]: ` Fine girl of her age , but small , ' observed Richard Swiveller parenthetically .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 32]: ` If I am to go on , be quiet for one minute , ' returned Trent , fretting at the slight interest the other appeared to take in the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 10]: ` Now I 'm coming to the point . '
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 9]: ` That 's right , ' said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 27]: ` The girl has strong affections , and brought up as she has been , may , at her age , be easily influenced and persuaded .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 25]: If I take her in hand , I will be bound by a very little coaxing and threatening to bend her to my will .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 29]: Not to beat about the bush -LRB- for the advantages of the scheme would take a week to tell -RRB- what 's to prevent your marrying her ? '
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 54]: Richard Swiveller , who had been looking over the rim of the tumbler while his companion addressed the foregoing remarks to him with great energy and earnestness of manner , no sooner heard these words than he evinced the utmost consternation , and with difficulty ejaculated the monosyllable : ` What ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 44]: I say , what 's to prevent , ' repeated the other with a steadiness of manner , of the effect of which upon his companion he was well assured by long experience , ` what 's to prevent your marrying her ? '
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 9]: ` And she ` nearly fourteen ' ! '
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 4]: cried Dick . '
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 28]: I do n't mean marrying her now ' -- returned the brother angrily ; ` say in two year 's time , in three , in four .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 10]: Does the old man look like a long-liver ? '
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 29]: ` He do n't look like it , ' said Dick shaking his head , ` but these old people -- there 's no trusting them , Fred .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 29]: There 's an aunt of mind down in Dorsetshire that was going to die when I was eight years old , and has n't kept her word yet .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 41]: They 're so aggravating , so unprincipled , so spiteful -- unless there 's apoplexy in the family , Fred , you ca n't calculate upon 'em , and even then they deceive you just as often as not . '
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 27]: ` Look at the worst side of the question then , ' said Trent as steadily as before , and keeping his eyes upon his friend .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 6]: ` Suppose he lives . '
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 9]: ` To be sure , ' said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 8]: ` There 's the rub . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 34]: I say , ' resumed his friend , ` suppose he lives , and I persuaded , or if the word sounds more feasible , forced Nell to a secret marriage with you .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 11]: What do you think would come of that ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 23]: A family and an annual income of nothing , to keep 'em on , ' said Richard Swiveller after some reflection . '
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 85]: I tell you , ' returned the other with an increased earnestness , which , whether it were real or assumed , had the same effect on his companion , ` that he lives for her , that his whole energies and thoughts are bound up in her , that he would no more disinherit her for an act of disobedience than he would take me into his favour again for any act of obedience or virtue that I could possibly be guilty of .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 6]: He could not do it .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 19]: You or any other man with eyes in his head may see that , if he chooses . '
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 12]: ` It seems improbable certainly , ' said Dick , musing .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 14]: ` It seems improbable because it is improbable , ' his friend returned .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 54]: ` If you would furnish him with an additional inducement to forgive you , let there be an irreconcilable breach , a most deadly quarrel , between you and me -- let there be a pretense of such a thing , I mean , of course -- and he 'll do fast enough .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 26]: As to Nell , constant dropping will wear away a stone ; you know you may trust to me as far as she is concerned .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 14]: So , whether he lives or dies , what does it come to ?
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 37]: That you become the sole inheritor of the wealth of this rich old hunks , that you and I spend it together , and that you get into the bargain a beautiful young wife . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 15]: I suppose there 's no doubt about his being rich ' -- said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 3]: ` Doubt !
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 15]: Did you hear what he left fall the other day when we were there ?
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 2]: Doubt !
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 9]: What will you doubt next , Dick ? '
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 30]: It would be tedious to pursue the conversation through all its artful windings , or to develope the gradual approaches by which the heart of Richard Swiveller was gained .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 54]: It is sufficient to know that vanity , interest , poverty , and every spendthrift consideration urged him to look upon the proposal with favour , and that where all other inducements were wanting , the habitual carelessness of his disposition stepped in and still weighed down the scale on the same side .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 63]: To these impulses must be added the complete ascendancy which his friend had long been accustomed to exercise over him -- an ascendancy exerted in the beginning sorely at the expense of his friend 's vices , and was in nine cases out of ten looked upon as his designing tempter when he was indeed nothing but his thoughtless , light-headed tool .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 32]: The motives on the other side were something deeper than any which Richard Swiveller entertained or understood , but these being left to their own development , require no present elucidation .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 68]: the negotiation was concluded very pleasantly , and Mr Swiveller was in the act of stating in flowery terms that he had no insurmountable objection to marrying anybody plentifully endowed with money or moveables , who could be induced to take him , when he was interrupted in his observations by a knock at the door , and the consequent necessity of crying ` Come in . '
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 20]: The door was opened , but nothing came in except a soapy arm and a strong gush of tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 75]: The gush of tobacco came from the shop downstairs , and the soapy arm proceeded from the body of a servant-girl , who being then and there engaged in cleaning the stars had just drawn it out of a warm pail to take in a letter , which letter she now held in her hand , proclaiming aloud with that quick perception of surnames peculiar to her class that it was for Mister Snivelling .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 62]: Dick looked rather pale and foolish when he glanced at the direction , and still more so when he came to look at the inside , observing that it was one of the inconveniences of being a lady 's man , and that it was very easy to talk as they had been talking , but he had quite forgotten her .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 3]: ` Her .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 3]: Who ? '
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 3]: demanded Trent .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 8]: ` Sophy Wackles , ' said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 6]: ` Who 's she ? '
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 38]: ` She 's all my fancy painted her , sir , that 's what she is , ' said Mr Swiveller , taking a long pull at ` the rosy ' and looking gravely at his friend .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 9]: ` She 's lovely , she 's divine .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 6]: You know her . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 9]: I remember , ' said his companion carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 6]: ` What of her ? '
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 44]: ` Why , sir , ' returned Dick , ` between Miss Sophia Wackles and the humble individual who has now the honor to address you , warm and tender sentiments have been engendered , sentiments of the most honourable and inspiring kind .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 31]: The Goddess Diana , sir , that calls aloud for the chase , is not more particular in her behavior than Sophia Wackles ; I can tell you that . '
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 15]: ` Am I to believe there 's anything real in what you say ? '
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 20]: demanded his friend ; ` you do n't mean to say that any love-making has been going on ? '
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 5]: ` Love-making , yes .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 8]: Promising , no , ' said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 14]: ` There can be no action for breach , that 's one comfort .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 11]: I 've never committed myself in writing , Fred . '
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 12]: ` And what 's in the letter , pray ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 34]: A reminder , Fred , for to-night -- a small party of twenty , making two hundred light fantastic toes in all , supposing every lady and gentleman to have the proper complement .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 26]: It must go , if it 's only to begin breaking off the affair -- I 'll do it , do n't you be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 11]: I should like to know whether she left this herself .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 19]: If she did , unconscious of any bar to her happiness , it 's affecting , Fred . '
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 75]: To solve this question , Mr Swiveller summoned the handmaid and ascertained that Miss Sophy Wackles had indeed left the letter with her own hands ; and that she had come accompanied , for decorum 's sake no doubt , by a younger Miss Wackles ; and that on learning that Mr Swiveller was at home and being requested to walk upstairs , she was extremely shocked and professed that she would rather die .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 77]: Mr Swiveller heard this account with a degree of admiration not altogether consistent with the project in which he had just concurred , but his friend attached very little importance to his behavior in this respect , probably because he knew that he had influence sufficient to control Richard Swiveller 's proceedings in this or any other matter , whenever he deemed it necessary , for the advancement of his own purposes , to exert it .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 51]: Chapter 8 Business disposed of , Mr Swiveller was inwardly reminded of its being nigh dinner-time , and to the intent that his health might not be endangered by longer abstinence , dispached a message to the nearest eating-house requiring an immediate supply of boiled beef and greens for two .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 69]: With this demand , however , the eating-house -LRB- having experience of its customer -RRB- declined to comply , churlishly sending back for answer that if Mr Swiveller stood in need of beef perhaps he would be so obliging as to come there and eat it , bringing with him , as grace before meat , the amount of a certin small account which had long been outstanding .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 94]: Not at all intimidated by this rebuff , but rather sharpened in wits and appetite , Mr Swiveller forwarded the same message to another and more distant eating-house , adding to it by way of rider that the gentleman was induced to send so far , not only by the great fame and popularity its beef had acquired , but in consequence of the extreme toughness of the beef retailed at the obdurant cook 's shop , which rendered it quite unfit not merely for gentlemanly food , but for any human consumption .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 74]: The good effect of this politic course was demonstrated by the speedy arrive of a small pewter pyramid , curously constructed of platters and covers , whereof the boiled-beef-plates formed the base , and a foaming quart-pot the apex ; the structure being resolved into its component parts afforded all things requisite and necessary for a hearty meal , to which Mr Swiveller and his friend applied themselves with great keenness and enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 27]: ` May the present moment , ' said Dick , sticking his fork into a large carbuncular potato , ` be the worst of our lives !
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 41]: I like the plan of sending 'em with the peel on ; there 's a charm in drawing a poato from its native element -LRB- if I may so express it -RRB- to which the rich and powerful are strangers .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 15]: ` Man wants but little here below , nor wants that little long ! '
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 5]: How true that it !
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 6]: -- after dinner . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 38]: I hope the eating-house keeper will want but little and that he may not want that little long , ' returned his companion ; but I suspect you 've no means of paying for this ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 20]: I shall be passing present , and I 'll call , ' said Dick , winking his eye significantly .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 7]: ` The waiter 's quite helpless .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 16]: The goods are gone , Fred , and there 's an end of it . '
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 123]: In point of fact , it would seem that the waiter felt this wholesome truth , for when he returned for the empty plates and dishes and was informed by Mr Swiveller with dignified carelessness that he would call and setle when he should be passing presently , he displayed some pertubation of spirit and muttered a few remarks about ` payment on delivery ' and ` no trust , ' and other unpleasant subjects , but was fain to content himself with inquiring at what hour it was likely that the gentleman would call , in order that being presently responsible for the beef , greens , and sundries , he might take to be in the way at the time .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 53]: Mr Swiveller , after mentally calculating his engagements to a nicety , replied that he should look in at from two minutes before six and seven minutes past ; and the man disappearing with this feeble consolation , Richards Swiveller took a greasy memorandum-book from his pocket and made an entry therein .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 15]: ` Is that a reminder , in case you should forget to call ? '
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 6]: said Trent with a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 21]: ` Not exactly , Fred , ' replied the imperturable Richard , continuing to write with a businesslike air . '
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 23]: I enter in this little book the names of the streets that I ca n't go down while the shops are open .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 7]: This dinner today closes Long Acre .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 20]: I bought a pair of boots in Great Queen Street last week , and made that no throughfare too .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 27]: There 's only one avenue to the Strand left often now , and I shall have to stop up that to-night with a pair of gloves .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 44]: The roads are closing so fast in every direction , that in a month 's time , unless my aunt sends me a remittance , I shall have to go three or four miles out of town to get over the way . '
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 13]: ` There 's no fear of failing , in the end ? '
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 3]: said Trent .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 43]: ` Why , I hope not , ' returned Mr Swiveller , ` but the average number of letters it take to soften her is six , and this time we have got as far as eight without any effect at all .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 7]: I 'll write another tom-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 24]: I mean to blot it a good deal and shake some water over it out of the pepper-castor to make it look penitent .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 64]: ` I 'm in such a state of mind that I hardly know what I write ' -- blot -- ' if you could see me at this minute shedding tears for my past misconduct ' -- pepper-castor -- my hand trembles when I think ' -- blot again -- if that do n't produce the effect , it 's all over . '
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 36]: By this time , Mr Swiveller had finished his entry , and he now replaced his pencil in its little sheath and closed the book , in a perfectly grave and serious frame of mind .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 38]: His friend discovered that it was time for him to fulfil some other engagement , and Richard Swiveller was accordingly left alone , in company with the rosy wine and his own meditations touching Miss Sophy Wackles .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 72]: ` It 's rather sudden , ' said Dick shaking his head with a look of infinite wisdom , and running on -LRB- as he was accustomed to do -RRB- with scraps of verse as if they were only prose in a hurry ; ` when the heart of a man is depressed with fears , the mist is dispelled when Miss Wackles appears ; she 's a very nice girl .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 33]: She 's like the red red rose that 's newly sprung in June -- there 's no denying that -- she 's also like a melody that 's sweetly played in tune .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 6]: It 's really very sudden .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 29]: Not that there 's any need , on account of Fred 's little sister , to turn cool directly , but its better not to go too far .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 17]: If I begin to cool at all I must begin at once , I see that .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 14]: There 's the chance of an action for breach , that 's another .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 28]: There 's the chance of -- no , there 's no chance of that , but it 's as well to be on the safe side . '
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 65]: This undeveloped was the possibility , which Richard Swiveller sought to conceal even from himself , of his not being proof against the charms of Miss Wackles , and in some unguarded moment , by linking his fortunes to hers forever , of putting it out of his own power to further their notable scheme to which he had so readily become a party .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 30]: For all these reasons , he decided to pick a quarrel with Miss Wackles without delay , and casting about for a pretext determined in favour of groundless jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 68]: Having made up his mind on this important point , he circulated the glass -LRB- from his right hand to left , and back again -RRB- pretty freely , to enable him to act his part with the greater discretion , and then , after making some slight improvements in his toilet , bent his steps towards the spot hallowed by the fair object of his meditations .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 121]: The spot was at Chesea , for there Miss Sophia Wackles resided with her widowed mother and two sisters , in conjunction with whom she maintained a very small day-school for young ladies of proportionate dimensions ; a circumstance which was made known to the neighbourhood by an oval board over the front first-floor windows , whereupon appeared in circumbmbient flourishes the words ` Ladies ' Seminary ' ; and which was further published and proclaimed at intervals between the hours of half-past nine and ten in the morning , by a straggling and solitrary young lady of tender years standing on the scraper on the tips of her toes and making futile attempts to reach the knocker with spelling-book .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 12]: The several duties of instruction in this establishment were this discharged .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 66]: English grammar , composition , geography , and the use of the dumb-bells , by Miss Melissa Wackles ; writing , arthmetic , dancing , music , and general fascination , by Miss Sophia Wackles ; the art of needle-work , marking , and samplery , by Miss Jane Wackles ; corporal punishment , fasting , and other tortures and terrors , by Mrs Wackles .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 19]: Miss Melissa Wackles was the eldest daughter , Miss Sophy the next , and Miss Jane the youngest .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 38]: Miss Melissa might have seen five-and-thirty summers or thereabouts , and verged on the autumnal ; Miss Sophy was a fresh , good humoured , busom girl of twenty ; and Miss Jane numbered scarcely sixteen years .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 13]: Mrs Wackles was an excellent but rather vemenous old lady of three-score .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 159]: To this Ladies ' Seminary , then , Richard Swiveller hied , with designs obnoxious to the peace of the fair Sophia , who , arrayed in virgin white , embelished by no ornament but one blushing rose , received him on his arrival , in the midst of very elegant not to say brilliant preparations ; such as the embellishment of the room with the little flower-pots which always stood on the window-sill outside , save in windy weather when they blew into the area ; the choice attire of the day-scholars who were allowed to grace the festival ; the unwonted curls of Miss Jane Wackles who had kept her head during the whole of the preceding day screwed up tight in a yellow play-bill ; and the solemn gentility and stately bearing of the old lady and her eldest daughter , which struck Mr Swiveller as being uncommon but made no further impression upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 87]: The truth is -- and , as there is no accounting for tastes , even a taste so strange as this may be recorded without being looked upon as a wilful and malicious invention -- the truth is that neither Mrs Wackles nor her eldest daughter had at any time greatly favoured the pretensions of Mr Swiveller , being accustomed to make slight mention of him as ' a gay young man ' and to sigh and shake their heads ominously whenever his name was mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 57]: Mr Swiveller 's conduct in respect to Miss Sophy having been of that vague and dilitory kind which is usuaully looked upon as betokening no fixed matrimonial intentions , the young lady herself began in course of time to deem it highly desirable , that it should be brought to an issue one way or other .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 67]: Hence she had at last consented to play off against Richard Swiveller a stricken market-gardner known to be ready with his offer on the smallest encouragement , and hence -- as this occasion had been specially assigned for the purpose -- that great anxiety on her part for Richard Swiveller 's presence which had occasioned her to leave the note he has ben seen to receive .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 38]: ` If he has any expectations at all or any means of keeping a wife well , ' said Mrs Wackles to her eldest daughter , ` he 'll state 'em to us now or never . '
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 24]: -- ` If he really cares about me , ' thought Miss Sophy , ` he must tell me so , to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 83]: But all these sayings and doings and thinkings being unknown to Mr Swiveller , affected him not in the least ; he was debating in his mind how he could best turn jealous , and wishing that Sophy were for that occasion only far less pretty than she was , or that she were her own sister , which would have served his turn as well , when the company came , and among them the market-gardener , whose name was Cheggs .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 55]: But Mr Cheggs came not alone or unsupported , for he prudently brought along with him his sister , Miss Cheggs , who making straight to Miss Sophy and taking her by both hands , and kissing her on both cheeks , hoped in an audible whisper that they had not come too early .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 7]: ` Too early , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 4]: replied Miss Sophy .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 43]: ` Oh , my dear , ' rejoined Miss Cheggs in the same whisper as before , ` I 've been so tormented , so worried , that it 's a mercy we were not here at four o'clock in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 12]: Alick has been in such a state of impatience to come !
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 23]: You 'd hardly believe that he was dressed before dinner-time and has been looking at the clock and teasing me ever since .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 11]: It 's all your fault , you naughty thing . '
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 51]: Hereupon Miss Sophy blushed , and Mr Cheggs -LRB- who was bashful before ladies -RRB- blushed too , and Miss Sophy 's mother and sisters , to prevent Mr Cheggs from blushing more , lavished civilities and attentions upon him , and left Richard Swiveller to take care of himself .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 60]: Here was the very thing he wanted , here was good cause reason and foundation for pretending to be angry ; but having this cause reason and foundation which he had come expressly to seek , not expecting to find , Richard Swiveller was angry in sound earnest , and wondered what the devil Cheggs meant by his impudence .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 54]: However , Mr Swiveller had Miss Sophy 's hand for the first quadrille -LRB- country-dances being low , were utterly proscribed -RRB- and so gained an advantage over his rival , who sat despondingly in a corner and contemplated the glorious figure of the young lady as she moved through the mazy dance .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 79]: Nor was this the only start Mr Swiveller had of the market-gardener , for determining to show the family what quality of man they trifled with , and influenced perhaps by his late libations , he performed such feats of agility and such spins and twirls as filled the company with astonishment , and in particular caused a very long gentleman who was dancing with a very short scholar , to stand quite transfixed by wonder and admiration .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 44]: Even Mrs Wackles forgot for the moment to snubb three small young ladies who were inclined to be happy , and could not repress a rising thought that to have such a dancer as that in the family would be a pride indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 129]: At this momentous crisis , Miss Cheggs proved herself a vigourous and useful ally , for not confining herself to expressing by scornful smiles a contempt for Mr Swiveller 's accomplishments , she took every opportunity of whispering into Miss Sophy 's ear expressions of condolence and sympathy on her being worried by such a ridiculous creature , declaring that she was frightened to death lest Alick should fall upon , and beat him , in the fulness of his wrath , and entreating Miss Sophy to observe how the eyes of the said Alick gleamed with love and fury ; passions , it may be observed , which being too much for his eyes rushed into his nose also , and suffused it with a crimson glow .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 34]: ` You must dance with Miss Chegs , ' said Miss Sophy to Dick Swiviller , after she had herself danced twice with Mr Cheggs and made great show of encouraging his advances .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 15]: ` She 's a nice girl -- and her brother 's quite delightful . '
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 8]: ` Quite delightful , is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 3]: muttered Dick .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 21]: ` Quite delighted too , I should say , from the manner in which he 's looking this way . '
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 26]: Here Miss Jane -LRB- previously instructed for the purpose -RRB- interposed her many curls and whispered her sister to observe how jealous Mr Cheggs was .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 3]: ` Jealous !
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 5]: Like his impudence ! '
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 4]: said Richard Swiviller .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 8]: ` His impudence , Mr Swiviller ! '
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 8]: said Miss Jane , tossing her head .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 20]: ` Take care he do n't hear you , sir , or you may be sorry for it . '
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 12]: ` Oh , pray , Jane -- ' said Miss Sophy .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 4]: ` Nonsense ! '
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 4]: replied her sister .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 12]: ` Why should n't Mr Cheggs be jealous if he likes ?
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 6]: I like that , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 30]: Mr Cheggs has a good a right to be jealous as anyone else has , and perhaps he may have a better right soon if he has n't already .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 9]: You know best about that , Sophy ! '
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 87]: Though this was a concerted plot between Miss Sophy and her sister , originating in humane intenions and having for its object the inducing Mr Swiviller to declare himself in time , it failed in its effect ; for Miss Jane being one of those young ladies who are premeturely shrill and shrewish , gave such undue importance to her part that Mr Swiviller retired in dudgeon , resigning his mistress to Mr Cheggs and converying a definance into his looks which that gentleman indignantly returned .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 10]: ` Did you speak to me , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 10]: said Mr Cheggs , following him into a corner .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 18]: ` Have the kindness to smile , sir , in order that we may not be suspected .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 9]: Did you speak to me , sir ' ?
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 100]: Mr Swiviller looked with a supercilious smile at Mr Chegg 's toes , then raised his eyes from them to his ankles , from that to his shin , from that to his knee , and so on very gradually , keeping up his right leg , until he reached his waistcoat , when he raised his eyes from button to button until he reached his chin , and travelling straight up the middle of his nose came at last to his eyes , when he said abruptly , ` No , sir , I did n't . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 3]: Hem ! '
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 19]: said Mr Cheggs , glancing over his shoulder , ` have the goodness to smile again , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 11]: Perhaps you wished to speak to me , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 14]: ` No , sir , I did n't do that , either . '
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 20]: ` Perhaps you may have nothing to say to me now , sir , ' said Mr Cheggs fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 80]: At these words Richard Swiviller withdrew his eyes from Mr Chegg 's face , and travelling down the middle of his nose and down his waistcoat and down his right leg , reached his toes again , and carefully surveyed him ; this done , he crossed over , and coming up the other legt and thence approaching by the waistcoat as before , said when had got to his eyes , ` No sir , I have n't .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 10]: : ' ` Oh , indeed , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 4]: said Mr Cheggs .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 8]: ` I 'm glad to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 27]: You know where I 'm to be found , I suppose , sir , in case you should have anything to say to me ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 14]: I can easily inquire , sir , when I want to know . '
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 15]: ` There 's nothing more we need say , I believe , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 18]: ` Nothing more , sir ' -- With that they closed the tremendous dialog by frowning mutually .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 26]: Mr Cheggs hastened to tender his hand to Miss Sophy , and Mr Swiviller sat himself down in a corner in a very moody state .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 59]: Hard by this corner , Mrs Wackles and Miss Wackles were seated , looking on at the dance ; and unto Mrs and Miss Wackles , Miss Cheggs occasionally darted when her partner was occupied with his share of the figure , and made some remark or other which was gall and wormword to Richard Swiviller 's soul .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 97]: Looking into the eyes of Mrs and Miss Wackles for encouragement , and sitting very upright and uncomfortable on a couple of hard stools , were two of the day-scholars ; and when Miss Wackles smiled , and Mrs Wackles smiled , the two little girls on the stools sought to curry favour by smiling likewise , in gracious acknowledgement of which attention the old lady frowned them down instantly , and said that if they dared to be guilty of such an impertinence again , they should be sent under convoy to their respective homes .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 48]: This threat caused one of the young ladies , she being of a weak and trembling temperament , to shed tears , and for this offense they were both filed off immediately , with a dreadful promptitude that struck terror into the souls of all the pupils .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 27]: ` I 've got such news for you , ' said Miss Cheggs approaching once more , ` Alick has been saying such things to Sophy .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 20]: Upon my word , you know , it 's quite serious and in earnest , that 's clear . '
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 11]: ` What 's he been saying , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 4]: demanded Mrs Wackles .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 24]: ` All manner of things , ' replied Miss Cheggs , ` you ca n't think how out he has been speaking ! '
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 92]: Richard Swiviller considered it advisable to hear no more , but taking advantage of a pause in the dancing , and the approach of Mr Cheggs to pay his court to the old lady , swaggered with an extremely careful assumption of extreme carelessness toward the door , passing on the way Miss Jane Wackles , who in all the glory of her curls was holding a flirtation , -LRB- as good practice when no better was to be had -RRB- with a feeble old gentleman who lodged in the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 35]: Near the door sat Miss Sophy , still fluttered and confused by the attentions of Mr Cheggs , and by her side Richard Swiveller lingered for a moment to exchange a few parting words .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 37]: ` My boat is on the shore and my bark is on the sea , but before I pass this door I will say farewell to thee , ' murmured Dick , looking gloomily upon her .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 6]: ` Are you going ? '
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 24]: said Miss Sophy , whose heart sank within her at the result of her stratagem , but who affected a light indifference notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 6]: ` Am I going ! '
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 4]: echoed Dick bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 6]: ` Yes , I am .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 4]: What then ? '
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 28]: ` Nothing , except that it 's very early , ' said Miss Sophy ; ` but you are your own master , of course . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 26]: I would that I had been my own mistress too , ' said Dick , ` before I had ever entertained a thought of you .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 34]: Miss Wackles , I believed you true , and I was blest in so believing , but now I mourn that e'er I knew , a girl so fair yet so deceiving . '
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 25]: Miss Sophy bit her lip and affected to look with great interest after Mr Cheggs , who was quaffing lemonade in the distance . '
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 38]: I came here , ' said Dick , rather oblivious of the purpose with which he had really come , ` with my bosom expanded , my heart dilated , and my sentiments of a corresponding description .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 34]: I go away with feelings that may be conceived but can not be described , feeling within myself that desolating truth that my best affections have experienced this night a stifler ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 22]: I am sure I do n't know what you mean , Mr Swiviller , ' said Miss Sophy with downcast eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 14]: ` I 'm very sorry if -- ' ` Sorry , Ma'am ! '
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 12]: said Dick , ` sorry in the possession of a Cheegs !
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 73]: But I wish you a very good night , concluding with this slight remark , that there is a young lady growing up at this present moment for me , who has not only great personal attractions but great wealth , and who has requested her next of kin to propose for my hand , which , having a regard for some members of her family , I have consented to promise .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 37]: It 's a gratifying circumstance which you 'll be glad to hear , that a young and lovely girl is growing into a woman expressly on my account , and is now saving up for me .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 7]: I thought I 'd mention it .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 14]: I have now merely to apologize for trespassing so long upon your attention .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 4]: Good night . '
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 76]: ` There 's one good thing springs out of all this , ' said Richard Swiviller to himself when he had reached home and was hanging over the candle with the extinguisher in his hand , ` which is , that I now go heart and soul , neck and heels , with Fred in all his scheme about little Nelly , and right glad he 'll be to find me so strong upon it .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 32]: He shall know all about that to-morrow , and in the mean time , as it 's rather late , I 'll try and get a wink of the balmy . '
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 13]: ` The balmy ' came almost as soon as it was courted .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 47]: In a very few minutes Mr Swiviller was fast asleep , dreaming that he had married Nelly Trent and come into the property , and that his first act of power was to lay waste the market-garden of Mr Cheggs and turn it into a brick-field .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 43]: Chapter 9 The child , in her confidence with Mrs Quilp , had but feebly described the sadness and sorrow of her thoughts , or the heaviness of the cloud which overhung her home , and cast dark shadows on its hearth .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 80]: Besides that it was very difficult to impart to any person not intimately acquainted with the life she led , an adequate sense of its gloom and loneliness , a constant fear of in some way committing or injuring the old man to whom she was so tenderly attached , had restrained her , even in the midst of her heart 's overflowing , and made her timid of allusion to the main cause of her anxiety and distress .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 71]: For , it was not the monotonous days unchequered by variety and uncheered by pleasant companionship , it was not the dark dreary evenings or the long solitary nights , it was not the absence of every slight and easy pleasure for which young hearts beat high , or the knowing nothing of childhood but its weakness and its easily wounded spirit , that had wrung such tears from Nell .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 156]: To see the old man struck down beneath the pressure of some hidden grief , to mark his wavering and unsettled state , to be agitated at times with a dreadful fear that his mind was wandering , and to trace in his words and looks the dawning of despondent madness ; to watch and wait and listen for confirmation of these things day after day , and to feel and know that , come what might , they were alone in the world with no one to help or advise or care about them -- these were causes of depression and anxiety that might have sat heavily on an older breast with many influences at work to cheer and gladden it , but how heavily on the mind of a young child to whom they were ever present , and who was constantly surrounded by all that could keep such thoughts in restless action !
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 16]: And yet , to the old man 's vision , Nell was still the same .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 69]: When he could , for a moment , disengage his mind from the phantom that haunted and brooded on it always , there was his young companion with the same smile for him , the same earnest words , the same merry laugh , the same love and care that , sinking deep into his soul , seemed to have been present to him through his whole life .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 47]: And so he went on , content to read the book of her heart from the page first presented to him , little dreaming of the story that lay hidden in its other leaves , and murmuring within himself that at least the child was happy .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 5]: She had been once .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 41]: She had gone singing through the dim rooms , and moving with gay and lightsome step among their dusty treasures , making them older by her young life , and sterner and more grim by her gay and cheerful presence .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 62]: But , now , the chambers were cold and gloomy , and when she left her own little room to while away the tedious hours , and sat in one of them , she was still and motionless as their inanimate occupants , and had no heart to startle the echoes -- hoarse from their long silence -- with her voice .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 37]: In one of these rooms , was a window looking into the street , where the child sat , many and many a long evening , and often far into the night , alone and thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 26]: None are so anxious as those who watch and wait ; at these times , mournful fancies came flocking on her mind , in crowds .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 76]: She would take her station here , at dusk , and watch the people as they passed up and down the street , or appeared at the windows of the opposite houses ; wondering whether those rooms were as lonesome as that in which she sat , and whether those people felt it company to see her sitting there , as she did only to see them look out and draw in their heads again .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 84]: There was a crooked stack of chimneys on one of the roofs , in which , by often looking at them , she had fancied ugly faces that were frowning over at her and trying to peer into the room ; and she felt glad when it grew too dark to make them out , though she was sorry too , when the man came to light the lamps in the street -- for it made it late , and very dull inside .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 94]: Then , she would draw in her head to look round the room and see that everything was in its place and had n't moved ; and looking out into the street again , would perhaps see a man passing with a coffin on his back , and two or three others silently following him to a house where somebody lay dead ; which made her shudder and think of such things until they suggested afresh the old man 's altered face and manner , and a new train of fears and speculations .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 87]: If he were to die -- if sudden illness had happened to him , and he were never to come home again , alive -- if , one night , he should come home , and kiss and bless her as usual , and after she had gone to bed and had fallen asleep and was perhaps dreaming pleasantly , and smiling in her sleep , he should kill himself and his blood come creeping , creeping , on the ground to her own bed-room door !
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 33]: These thoughts were too terrible to dwell upon , and again she would have recourse to the street , now trodden by fewer feet , and darker and more silent than before .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 23]: The shops were closing fast , and lights began to shine from the upper windows , as the neighbours went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 27]: By degrees , these dwindled away and disappeared or were replaced , here and there , by a feeble rush-candle which was to burn all night .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 29]: Still , there was one late shop at no great distance which sent forth a ruddy glare upon the pavement even yet , and looked bright and companionable .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 53]: But , in a little time , this closed , the light was extinguished , and all was gloomy and quiet , except when some stray footsteps sounded on the pavement , or a neighbour , out later than his wont , knocked lustily at his house-door to rouse the sleeping inmates .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 74]: When the night had worn away thus far -LRB- and seldom now until it had -RRB- the child would close the window , and steal softly down stairs , thinking as she went that if one of those hideous faces below , which often mingled with her dreams , were to meet her by the way , rendering itself visible by some strange light of its own , how terrified she would be .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 17]: But these fears vanished before a well-trimmed lamp and the familiar aspect of her own room .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 74]: After praying fervently , and with many bursting tears , for the old man , and the restoration of his peace of mind and the happiness they had once enjoyed , she would lay her head upon the pillow and sob herself to sleep : often starting up again , before the day-light came , to listen for the bell and respond to the imaginary summons which had roused her from her slumber .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 33]: One night , the third after Nelly 's interview with Mrs Quilp , the old man , who had been weak and ill all day , said he should not leave home .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 23]: The child 's eyes sparkled at the intelligence , but her joy subsided when they reverted to his worn and sickly face .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 24]: ` Two days , ' he said , ` two whole , clear , days have passed , and there is no reply .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 9]: What did he tell thee , Nell ? '
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 13]: ` Exactly what I told you , dear grandfather , indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 11]: ` True , ' said the old man , faintly .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 7]: But tell me again , Nell .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 5]: My head fails me .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 8]: What was it that he told thee ?
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 13]: Nothing more than that he would see me to-morrow or next day ?
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 7]: That was in the note . '
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 9]: ` Nothing more , ' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 12]: ` Shall I go to him again to-morrow , dear grandfather ?
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 3]: Very early ?
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 11]: I will be there and back , before breakfast . '
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 17]: The old man shook his head , and sighing mournfully , drew her towards him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 13]: Twould be of no use , my dear , no earthly use .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 78]: But if he deserts me , Nell , at this moment -- if he deserts me now , when I should , with his assistance , be recompensed for all the time and money I have lost , and all the agony of mind I have undergone , which makes me what you see , I am ruined , and -- worse , far worse than that -- have ruined thee , for whom I ventured all .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 7]: If we are beggars -- ! '
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 7]: ` What if we are ? '
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 5]: said the child boldly .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 11]: ` Let us be beggars , and be happy . '
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 7]: ` Beggars -- and happy ! '
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 5]: said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 5]: ` Poor child ! '
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 74]: ` Dear grandfather , ' cried the girl with an energy which shone in her flushed face , trembling voice , and impassioned gesture , ' I am not a child in that I think , but even if I am , oh hear me pray that we may beg , or work in open roads or fields , to earn a scanty living , rather than live as we do now . '
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 4]: ` Nelly ! '
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 5]: said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 23]: ` Yes , yes , rather than live as we do now , ' the child repeated , more earnestly than before .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 38]: ` If you are sorrowful , let me know why and be sorrowful too ; if you waste away and are paler and weaker every day , let me be your nurse and try to comfort you .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 46]: If you are poor , let us be poor together ; but let me be with you , do let me be with you ; do not let me see such change and not know why , or I shall break my heart and die .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 21]: Dear grandfather , let us leave this sad place to-morrow , and beg our way from door to door . '
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 24]: The old man covered his face with his hands , and hid it in the pillow of the couch on which he lay .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 34]: ` Let us be beggars , ' said the child passing an arm round his neck , ' I have no fear but we shall have enough , I am sure we shall .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 53]: Let us walk through country places , and sleep in fields and under trees , and never think of money again , or anything that can make you sad , but rest at nights , and have the sun and wind upon our faces in the day , and thank God together !
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 56]: Let us never set foot in dark rooms or melancholy houses , any more , but wander up and down wherever we like to go ; and when you are tired , you shall stop to rest in the pleasantest place that we can find , and I will go and beg for both . '
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 24]: The child 's voice was lost in sobs as she dropped upon the old man 's neck ; nor did she weep alone .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 17]: These were not words for other ears , nor was it a scene for other eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 80]: And yet other ears and eyes were there and greedily taking in all that passed , and moreover they were the ears and eyes of no less a person than Mr Daniel Quilp , who , having entered unseen when the child first placed herself at the old man 's side , refrained -- actuated , no doubt , by motives of the purest delicacy -- from interrupting the conversation , and stood looking on with his accustomed grin .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 102]: Standing , however , being a tiresome attitude to a gentleman already fatigued with walking , and the dwarf being one of that kind of persons who usually make themselves at home , he soon cast his eyes upon a chair , into which he skipped with uncommon agility , and perching himself on the back with his feet upon the seat , was thus enabled to look on and listen with greater comfort to himself , besides gratifying at the same time that taste for doing something fantastic and monkey-like , which on all occasions had strong possession of him .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 44]: Here , then , he sat , one leg cocked carelessly over the other , his chin resting on the palm of his hand , his head turned a little on one side , and his ugly features twisted into a complacent grimace .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 30]: And in this position the old man , happening in course of time to look that way , at length chanced to see him : to his unbounded astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 40]: The child uttered a suppressed shriek on beholding this agreeable figure ; in their first surprise both she and the old man , not knowing what to say , and half doubting its reality , looked shrinkingly at it .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 24]: Not at all disconcerted by this reception , Daniel Quilp preserved the same attitude , merely nodding twice or thrice with great condescension .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 17]: At length , the old man pronounced his name , and inquired how he came there .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 16]: ` Through the door , ' said Quilp pointing over his shoulder with his thumb .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 12]: ` I 'm not quite small enough to get through key-holes .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 5]: I wish I was .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 15]: I want to have some talk with you , particularly , and in private .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 6]: With nobody present , neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 6]: Good-bye , little Nelly . '
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 19]: Nell looked at the old man , who nodded to her to retire , and kissed her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 22]: said the dwarf , smacking his lips , ` what a nice kiss that was -- just upon the rosy part .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 6]: What a capital kiss ! '
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 13]: Nell was none the slower in going away , for this remark .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 27]: Quilp looked after her with an admiring leer , and when she had closed the door , fell to complimenting the old man upon her charms .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 43]: ` Such a fresh , blooming , modest little bud , neighbour , ' said Quilp , nursing his short leg , and making his eyes twinkle very much ; ` such a chubby , rosy , cosy , little Nell ! '
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 24]: The old man answered by a forced smile , and was plainly struggling with a feeling of the keenest and most exquisite impatience .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 22]: It was not lost upon Quilp , who delighted in torturing him , or indeed anybody else , when he could .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 65]: ` She 's so , ' said Quilp , speaking very slowly , and feigning to be quite absorbed in the subject , ` so small , so compact , so beautifully modelled , so fair , with such blue veins and such a transparent skin , and such little feet , and such winning ways -- but bless me , you 're nervous !
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 8]: Why neighbour , what 's the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 58]: I swear to you , ' continued the dwarf dismounting from the chair and sitting down in it , with a careful slowness of gesture very different from the rapidity with which he had sprung up unheard , ' I swear to you that I had no idea old blood ran so fast or kept so warm .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 15]: I thought it was sluggish in its course , and cool , quite cool .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 9]: I am pretty sure it ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 11]: Yours must be out of order , neighbour . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 18]: I believe it is , ' groaned the old man , clasping his head with both hands .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 22]: ` There 's burning fever here , and something now and then to which I fear to give a name . '
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 28]: The dwarf said never a word , but watched his companion as he paced restlessly up and down the room , and presently returned to his seat .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 39]: Here he remained , with his head bowed upon his breast for some time , and then suddenly raising it , said , ` Once , and once for all , have you brought me any money ? '
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 3]: returned Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 27]: ` Then , ' said the old man , clenching his hands desperately , and looking upwards , ` the child and I are lost ! '
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 58]: ` Neighbour , ' said Quilp glancing sternly at him , and beating his hand twice or thrice upon the table to attract his wandering attention , ` let me be plain with you , and play a fairer game than when you held all the cards , and I saw but the backs and nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 9]: You have no secret from me now . '
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 8]: The old man looked up , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 9]: ` You are surprised , ' said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 8]: ` Well , perhaps that 's natural .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 16]: You have no secret from me now , I say ; no , not one .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 42]: For now , I know , that all those sums of money , that all those loans , advances , and supplies that you have had from me , have found their way to -- shall I say the word ? '
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 4]: ` Aye ! '
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 14]: replied the old man , ` say it , if you will . '
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 14]: ` To the gaming-table , ' rejoined Quilp , ` your nightly haunt .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 58]: This was the precious scheme to make your fortune , was it ; this was the secret certain source of wealth in which I was to have sunk my money -LRB- if I had been the fool you took me for -RRB- ; this was your inexhaustible mine of gold , your El Dorado , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 20]: ` Yes , ' cried the old man , turning upon him with gleaming eyes , ` it was .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 3]: It is .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 9]: It will be , till I die . '
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 25]: ` That I should have been blinded , ' said Quilp looking contemptuously at him , ` by a mere shallow gambler ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 13]: I am no gambler , ' cried the old man fiercely . '
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 49]: I call Heaven to witness that I never played for gain of mine , or love of play ; that at every piece I staked , I whispered to myself that orphan 's name and called on Heaven to bless the venture ; -- which it never did .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 5]: Whom did it prosper ?
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 8]: Who were those with whom I played ?
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 24]: Men who lived by plunder , profligacy , and riot ; squandering their gold in doing ill , and propagating vice and evil .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 33]: My winnings would have been from them , my winnings would have been bestowed to the last farthing on a young sinless child whose life they would have sweetened and made happy .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 6]: What would they have contracted ?
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 10]: The means of corruption , wretchedness , and misery .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 10]: Who would not have hoped in such a cause ?
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 4]: Tell me that !
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 10]: Who would not have hoped as I did ? '
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 11]: ` When did you first begin this mad career ? '
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 21]: asked Quilp , his taunting inclination subdued , for a moment , by the old man 's grief and wildness .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 8]: ` When did I first begin ? '
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 10]: he rejoined , passing his hand across his brow .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 10]: ` When was it , that I first began ?
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 81]: When should it be , but when I began to think how little I had saved , how long a time it took to save at all , how short a time I might have at my age to live , and how she would be left to the rough mercies of the world , with barely enough to keep her from the sorrows that wait on poverty ; then it was that I began to think about it . '
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 18]: ` After you first came to me to get your precious grandson packed off to sea ? '
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 3]: said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 12]: ` Shortly after that , ' replied the old man . '
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 17]: I thought of it a long time , and had it in my sleep for months .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 4]: Then I began .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 11]: I found no pleasure in it , I expected none .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 30]: What has it ever brought me but anxious days and sleepless nights ; but loss of health and peace of mind , and gain of feebleness and sorrow ! '
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 18]: ` You lost what money you had laid by , first , and then came to me .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 24]: While I thought you were making your fortune -LRB- as you said you were -RRB- you were making yourself a beggar , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 3]: Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 54]: And so it comes to pass that I hold every security you could scrape together , and a bill of sale upon the -- upon the stock and property , ' said Quilp standing up and looking about him , as if to assure himself that none of it had been taken away .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 8]: ` But did you never win ? '
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 4]: ` Never ! '
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 5]: groaned the old man .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 9]: ` Never won back my loss ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 38]: I thought , ' sneered the dwarf , ` that if a man played long enough he was sure to win at last , or , at the worst , not to come off a loser . '
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 66]: ` And so he is , ' cried the old man , suddenly rousing himself from his state of despondency , and lashed into the most violent excitement , ` so he is ; I have felt that from the first , I have always known it , I 've seen it , I never felt it half so strongly as I feel it now .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 30]: Quilp , I have dreamed , three nights , of winning the same large sum , I never could dream that dream before , though I have often tried .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 11]: Do not desert me , now I have this chance .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 21]: I have no resource but you , give me some help , let me try this one last hope . '
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 10]: The dwarf shrugged his shoulders and shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 40]: ` See , Quilp , good tender-hearted Quilp , ' said the old man , drawing some scraps of paper from his pocket with a trembling hand , and clasping the dwarf 's arm , ` only see here .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 17]: Look at these figures , the result of long calculation , and painful and hard experience .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 4]: I MUST win .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 22]: I only want a little help once more , a few pounds , but two score pounds , dear Quilp . '
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 22]: ` The last advance was seventy , ' said the dwarf ; ` and it went in one night . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 30]: I know it did , ' answered the old man , ` but that was the very worst fortune of all , and the time had not come then .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 39]: Quilp , consider , consider , ' the old man cried , trembling so much the while , that the papers in his hand fluttered as if they were shaken by the wind , ` that orphan child !
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 65]: If I were alone , I could die with gladness -- perhaps even anticipate that doom which is dealt out so unequally : coming , as it does , on the proud and happy in their strength , and shunning the needy and afflicted , and all who court it in their despair -- but what I have done , has been for her .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 17]: Help me for her sake I implore you ; not for mine ; for hers ! '
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 50]: ` I 'm sorry I 've got an appointment in the city , ' said Quilp , looking at his watch with perfect self-possession , ` or I should have been very glad to have spent half an hour with you while you composed yourself , very glad . '
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 38]: ` Nay , Quilp , good Quilp , ' gasped the old man , catching at his skirts , ` you and I have talked together , more than once , of her poor mother 's story .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 16]: The fear of her coming to poverty has perhaps been bred in me by that .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 13]: Do not be hard upon me , but take that into account .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 8]: You are a great gainer by me .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 13]: Oh spare me the money for this one last hope ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 84]: I could n't do it really , ' said Quilp with unusual politeness , ` though I tell you what -- and this is a circumstance worth bearing in mind as showing how the sharpest among us may be taken in sometimes -- I was so deceived by the penurious way in which you lived , alone with Nelly -- ' ` All done to save money for tempting fortune , and to make her triumph greater , ' cried the old man .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 102]: ` Yes , yes , I understand that now , ' said Quilp ; ` but I was going to say , I was so deceived by that , your miserly way , the reputation you had among those who knew you of being rich , and your repeated assurances that you would make of my advances treble and quadruple the interest you paid me , that I 'd have advanced you , even now , what you want , on your simple note of hand , if I had n't unexpectedly become acquainted with your secret way of life . '
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 23]: ` Who is it , ' retorted the old man desperately , ` that , notwithstanding all my caution , told you ?
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 2]: Come .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 10]: Let me know the name -- the person . '
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 58]: The crafty dwarf , bethinking himself that his giving up the child would lead to the disclosure of the artifice he had employed , which , as nothing was to be gained by it , it was well to conceal , stopped short in his answer and said , ` Now , who do you think ? '
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 24]: ` It was Kit , it must have been the boy ; he played the spy , and you tampered with him ? '
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 5]: said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 10]: ` How came you to think of him ? '
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 10]: said the dwarf in a tone of great commiseration .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 7]: ` Yes , it was Kit .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 4]: Poor Kit ! '
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 33]: So saying , he nodded in a friendly manner , and took his leave : stopping when he had passed the outer door a little distance , and grinning with extraordinary delight .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 5]: ` Poor Kit ! '
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 4]: muttered Quilp . '
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 25]: I think it was Kit who said I was an uglier dwarf than could be seen anywhere for a penny , was n't it .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 4]: Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 4]: Poor Kit ! '
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 14]: And with that he went his way , still chuckling as he went .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 16]: Chapter 10 Daniel Quilp neither entered nor left the old man 's house , unobserved .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 86]: In the shadow of an archway nearly opposite , leading to one of the many passages which diverged from the main street , there lingered one , who , having taken up his position when the twilight first came on , still maintained it with undiminished patience , and leaning against the wall with the manner of a person who had a long time to wait , and being well used to it was quite resigned , scarcely changed his attitude for the hour together .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 20]: This patient lounger attracted little attention from any of those who passed , and bestowed as little upon them .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 20]: His eyes were constantly directed towards one object ; the window at which the child was accustomed to sit .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 39]: If he withdrew them for a moment , it was only to glance at a clock in some neighbouring shop , and then to strain his sight once more in the old quarter with increased earnestness and attention .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 26]: It had been remarked that this personage evinced no weariness in his place of concealment ; nor did he , long as his waiting was .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 29]: But as the time went on , he manifested some anxiety and surprise , glancing at the clock more frequently and at the window less hopefully than before .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 50]: At length , the clock was hidden from his sight by some envious shutters , then the church steeples proclaimed eleven at night , then the quarter past , and then the conviction seemed to obtrude itself on his mind that it was no use tarrying there any longer .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 83]: That the conviction was an unwelcome one , and that he was by no means willing to yield to it , was apparent from his reluctance to quit the spot ; from the tardy steps with which he often left it , still looking over his shoulder at the same window ; and from the precipitation with which he as often returned , when a fancied noise or the changing and imperfect light induced him to suppose it had been softly raised .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 50]: At length , he gave the matter up , as hopeless for that night , and suddenly breaking into a run as though to force himself away , scampered off at his utmost speed , nor once ventured to look behind him lest he should be tempted back again .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 68]: Without relaxing his pace , or stopping to take breath , this mysterious individual dashed on through a great many alleys and narrow ways until he at length arrived in a square paved court , when he subsided into a walk , and making for a small house from the window of which a light was shining , lifted the latch of the door and passed in .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 5]: ` Bless us ! '
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 12]: cried a woman turning sharply round , ` who 's that ?
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 7]: It 's you , Kit ! '
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 10]: ` Yes , mother , it 's me . '
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 12]: ` Why , how tired you look , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 27]: ` Old master a n't gone out to-night , ' said Kit ; ` and so she has n't been at the window at all . '
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 17]: With which words , he sat down by the fire and looked very mournful and discontented .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 54]: The room in which Kit sat himself down , in this condition , was an extremely poor and homely place , but with that air of comfort about it , nevertheless , which -- or the spot must be a wretched one indeed -- cleanliness and order can always impart in some degree .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 143]: Late as the Dutch clock ' showed it to be , the poor woman was still hard at work at an ironing-table ; a young child lay sleeping in a cradle near the fire ; and another , a sturdy boy of two or three years old , very wide awake , with a very tight night-cap on his head , and a night-gown very much too small for him on his body , was sitting bolt upright in a clothes-basket , staring over the rim with his great round eyes , and looking as if he had thoroughly made up his mind never to go to sleep any more ; which , as he had already declined to take his natural rest and had been brought out of bed in consequence , opened a cheerful prospect for his relations and friends .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 21]: It was rather a queer-looking family : Kit , his mother , and the children , being all strongly alike .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 72]: Kit was disposed to be out of temper , as the best of us are too often -- but he looked at the youngest child who was sleeping soundly , and from him to his other brother in the clothes-basket , and from him to their mother , who had been at work without complaint since morning , and thought it would be a better and kinder thing to be good-humoured .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 38]: So he rocked the cradle with his foot ; made a face at the rebel in the clothes-basket , which put him in high good-humour directly ; and stoutly determined to be talkative and make himself agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 6]: ` Ah , mother ! '
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 36]: said Kit , taking out his clasp-knife , and falling upon a great piece of bread and meat which she had had ready for him , hours before , ` what a one you are !
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 13]: There a n't many such as you , I know . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 39]: I hope there are many a great deal better , Kit , ' said Mrs Nubbles ; ` and that there are , or ought to be , accordin ' to what the parson at chapel says . '
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 12]: ` Much he knows about it , ' returned Kit contemptuously .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 52]: ` Wait till he 's a widder and works like you do , and gets as little , and does as much , and keeps his spirit up the same , and then I 'll ask him what 's o'clock and trust him for being right to half a second . '
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 26]: ` Well , ' said Mrs Nubbles , evading the point , ` your beer 's down there by the fender , Kit . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 22]: I see , ' replied her son , taking up the porter pot , ` my love to you , mother .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 10]: And the parson 's health too if you like .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 12]: I do n't bear him any malice , not I ! '
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 19]: ` Did you tell me , just now , that your master had n't gone out to-night ? '
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 4]: inquired Mrs Nubbles .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 12]: ` Yes , ' said Kit , ` worse luck ! '
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 27]: ` You should say better luck , I think , ' returned his mother , ` because Miss Nelly wo n't have been left alone . '
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 8]: said Kit , ' I forgot that .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 23]: I said worse luck , because I 've been watching ever since eight o'clock , and seen nothing of her . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 90]: I wonder what she 'd say , ' cried his mother , stopping in her work and looking round , ` if she knew that every night , when she -- poor thing -- is sitting alone at that window , you are watching in the open street for fear any harm should come to her , and that you never leave the place or come home to your bed though you 're ever so tired , till such time as you think she 's safe in hers . '
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 39]: ` Never mind what she 'd say , ' replied Kit , with something like a blush on his uncouth face ; ` she 'll never know nothing , and consequently , she 'll never say nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 108]: Mrs Nubbles ironed away in silence for a minute or two , and coming to the fireplace for another iron , glanced stealthily at Kit while she rubbed it on a board and dusted it with a duster , but said nothing until she had returned to her table again : when , holding the iron at an alarmingly short distance from her cheek , to test its temperature , and looking round with a smile , she observed : ' I know what some people would say , Kit -- ' ` Nonsense , ' interposed Kit with a perfect apprehension of what was to follow .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 8]: ` No , but they would indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 19]: Some people would say that you 'd fallen in love with her , I know they would . '
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 35]: To this , Kit only replied by bashfully bidding his mother ` get out , ' and forming sundry strange figures with his legs and arms , accompanied by sympathetic contortions of his face .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 47]: Not deriving from these means the relief which he sought , he bit off an immense mouthful from the bread and meat , and took a quick drink of the porter ; by which artificial aids he choked himself and effected a diversion of the subject .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 85]: ` Speaking seriously though , Kit , ' said his mother , taking up the theme afresh , after a time , ` for of course I was only in joke just now , it 's very good and thoughtful , and like you , to do this , and never let anybody know it , though some day I hope she may come to know it , for I 'm sure she would be very grateful to you and feel it very much .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 14]: It 's a cruel thing to keep the dear child shut up there .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 16]: I do n't wonder that the old gentleman wants to keep it from you . '
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 55]: ` He do n't think it 's cruel , bless you , ' said Kit , ` and do n't mean it to be so , or he would n't do it -- I do consider , mother , that he would n't do it for all the gold and silver in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 9]: No , no , that he would n't .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 8]: I know him better than that . '
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 21]: ` Then what does he do it for , and why does he keep it so close from you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 4]: said Mrs Nubbles .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 12]: ` That I do n't know , ' returned her son .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 54]: ` If he had n't tried to keep it so close though , I should never have found it out , for it was his getting me away at night and sending me off so much earlier than he used to , that first made me curious to know what was going on .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 2]: Hark !
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 5]: what 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 8]: ` It 's only somebody outside . '
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 24]: ` It 's somebody crossing over here , ' said Kit , standing up to listen , ` and coming very fast too .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 19]: He ca n't have gone out after I left , and the house caught fire , mother ! '
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 25]: The boy stood , for a moment , really bereft , by the apprehension he had conjured up , of the power to move .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 37]: The footsteps drew nearer , the door was opened with a hasty hand , and the child herself , pale and breathless , and hastily wrapped in a few disordered garments , hurried into the room .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 4]: ` Miss Nelly !
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 6]: What is the matter ! '
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 7]: cried mother and son together . '
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 19]: I must not stay a moment , ' she returned , ` grandfather has been taken very ill .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 28]: I found him in a fit upon the floor -- ' ` I 'll run for a doctor ' -- said Kit , seizing his brimless hat .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 44]: ` I 'll be there directly , I 'll -- ' ` No , no , ' cried Nell , ` there is one there , you 're not wanted , you -- you -- must never come near us any more ! '
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 4]: ` What ! '
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 3]: roared Kit .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 9]: ` Never again , ' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 13]: ` Do n't ask me why , for I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 21]: Pray do n't ask me why , pray do n't be sorry , pray do n't be vexed with me !
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 10]: I have nothing to do with it indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 29]: Kit looked at her with his eyes stretched wide ; and opened and shut his mouth a great many times ; but could n't get out one word .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 34]: ` He complains and raves of you , ' said the child , ' I do n't know what you have done , but I hope it 's nothing very bad . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 4]: I done ! '
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 3]: roared Kit .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 42]: ` He cries that you 're the cause of all his misery , ' returned the child with tearful eyes ; ` he screamed and called for you ; they say you must not come near him or he will die .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 9]: You must not return to us any more .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 6]: I came to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 15]: I thought it would be better that I should come than somebody quite strange .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 9]: Oh , Kit , what have you done ?
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 20]: You , in whom I trusted so much , and who were almost the only friend I had ! '
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 28]: The unfortunate Kit looked at his young mistress harder and harder , and with eyes growing wider and wider , but was perfectly motionless and silent . '
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 44]: I have brought his money for the week , ' said the child , looking to the woman and laying it on the table -- ` and -- and -- a little more , for he was always good and kind to me .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 20]: I hope he will be sorry and do well somewhere else and not take this to heart too much .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 18]: It grieves me very much to part with him like this , but there is no help .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 5]: It must be done .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 4]: Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 60]: With the tears streaming down her face , and her slight figure trembling with the agitation of the scene she had left , the shock she had received , the errand she had just discharged , and a thousand painful and affectionate feelings , the child hastened to the door , and disappeared as rapidly as she had come .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 40]: The poor woman , who had no cause to doubt her son , but every reason for relying on his honesty and truth , was staggered , notwithstanding , by his not having advanced one word in his defence .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 43]: Visions of gallantry , knavery , robbery ; and of the nightly absences from home for which he had accounted so strangely , having been occasioned by some unlawful pursuit ; flocked into her brain and rendered her afraid to question him .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 27]: She rocked herself upon a chair , wringing her hands and weeping bitterly , but Kit made no attempt to comfort her and remained quite bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 60]: The baby in the cradle woke up and cried ; the boy in the clothes-basket fell over on his back with the basket upon him , and was seen no more ; the mother wept louder yet and rocked faster ; but Kit , insensible to all the din and tumult , remained in a state of utter stupefaction .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 22]: Chapter 11 Quiet and solitude were destined to hold uninterrupted rule no longer , beneath the roof that sheltered the child .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 35]: Next morning , the old man was in a raging fever accompanied with delirium ; and sinking under the influence of this disorder he lay for many weeks in imminent peril of his life .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 60]: There was watching enough , now , but it was the watching of strangers who made a greedy trade of it , and who , in the intervals in their attendance upon the sick man huddled together with a ghastly good-fellowship , and ate and drank and made merry ; for disease and death were their ordinary household gods .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 55]: Yet , in all the hurry and crowding of such a time , the child was more alone than she had ever been before ; alone in spirit , alone in her devotion to him who was wasting away upon his burning bed ; alone in her unfeigned sorrow , and her unpurchased sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 51]: Day after day , and night after night , found her still by the pillow of the unconscious sufferer , still anticipating his every want , still listening to those repetitions of her name and those anxieties and cares for her , which were ever uppermost among his feverish wanderings .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 7]: The house was no longer theirs .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 19]: Even the sick chamber seemed to be retained , on the uncertain tenure of Mr Quilp 's favour .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 44]: The old man 's illness had not lasted many days when he took formal possession of the premises and all upon them , in virtue of certain legal powers to that effect , which few understood and none presumed to call in question .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 59]: This important step secured , with the assistance of a man of law whom he brought with him for the purpose , the dwarf proceeded to establish himself and his coadjutor in the house , as an assertion of his claim against all comers ; and then set about making his quarters comfortable , after his own fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 28]: To this end , Mr Quilp encamped in the back parlour , having first put an effectual stop to any further business by shutting up the shop .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 67]: Having looked out , from among the old furniture , the handsomest and most commodious chair he could possibly find -LRB- which he reserved for his own use -RRB- and an especially hideous and uncomfortable one -LRB- which he considerately appropriated to the accommodation of his friend -RRB- he caused them to be carried into this room , and took up his position in great state .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 58]: The apartment was very far removed from the old man 's chamber , but Mr Quilp deemed it prudent , as a precaution against infection from fever , and a means of wholesome fumigation , not only to smoke , himself , without cessation , but to insist upon it that his legal friend did the like .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 74]: Moreover , he sent an express to the wharf for the tumbling boy , who arriving with all despatch was enjoined to sit himself down in another chair just inside the door , continually to smoke a great pipe which the dwarf had provided for the purpose , and to take it from his lips under any pretence whatever , were it only for one minute at a time , if he dared .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 21]: These arrangements completed , Mr Quilp looked round him with chuckling satisfaction , and remarked that he called that comfort .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 65]: The legal gentleman , whose melodious name was Brass , might have called it comfort also but for two drawbacks : one was , that he could by no exertion sit easy in his chair , the seat of which was very hard , angular , slippery , and sloping ; the other , that tobacco-smoke always caused him great internal discomposure and annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 39]: But as he was quite a creature of Mr Quilp 's and had a thousand reasons for conciliating his good opinion , he tried to smile , and nodded his acquiescence with the best grace he could assume .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 49]: This Brass was an attorney of no very good repute , from Bevis Marks in the city of London ; he was a tall , meagre man , with a nose like a wen , a protruding forehead , retreating eyes , and hair of a deep red .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 27]: He wore a long black surtout reaching nearly to his ankles , short black trousers , high shoes , and cotton stockings of a bluish grey .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 49]: He had a cringing manner , but a very harsh voice ; and his blandest smiles were so extremely forbidding , that to have had his company under the least repulsive circumstances , one would have wished him to be out of temper that he might only scowl .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 55]: Quilp looked at his legal adviser , and seeing that he was winking very much in the anguish of his pipe , that he sometimes shuddered when he happened to inhale its full flavour , and that he constantly fanned the smoke from him , was quite overjoyed and rubbed his hands with glee .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 54]: ` Smoke away , you dog , ' said Quilp , turning to the boy ; ` fill your pipe again and smoke it fast , down to the last whiff , or I 'll put the sealing-waxed end of it in the fire and rub it red hot upon your tongue . '
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 21]: Luckily the boy was case-hardened , and would have smoked a small lime-kiln if anybody had treated him with it .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 19]: Wherefore , he only muttered a brief defiance of his master , and did as he was ordered .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 24]: ` Is it good , Brass , is it nice , is it fragrant , do you feel like the Grand Turk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 3]: said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 40]: Mr Brass thought that if he did , the Grand Turk 's feelings were by no means to be envied , but he said it was famous , and he had no doubt he felt very like that Potentate .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 27]: ` This is the way to keep off fever , ' said Quilp , ` this is the way to keep off every calamity of life !
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 27]: We 'll never leave off , all the time we stop here -- smoke away , you dog , or you shall swallow the pipe ! '
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 11]: ` Shall we stop here long , Mr Quilp ? '
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 16]: inquired his legal friend , when the dwarf had given his boy this gentle admonition .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 21]: ` We must stop , I suppose , till the old gentleman up stairs is dead , ' returned Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 6]: ` He he he ! '
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 7]: laughed Mr Brass , ` oh !
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 4]: very good ! '
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 5]: ` Smoke away ! '
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 3]: cried Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 4]: ` Never stop !
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 7]: You can talk as you smoke .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 6]: Do n't lose time . '
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 6]: ` He he he ! '
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 14]: cried Brass faintly , as he again applied himself to the odious pipe .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 12]: ` But if he should get better , Mr Quilp ? '
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 18]: ` Then we shall stop till he does , and no longer , ' returned the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 16]: ` How kind it is of you , Sir , to wait till then ! '
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 3]: said Brass .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 25]: ` Some people , Sir , would have sold or removed the goods -- oh dear , the very instant the law allowed 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 13]: Some people , Sir , would have been all flintiness and granite .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 30]: Some people , sir , would have -- ' ` Some people would have spared themselves the jabbering of such a parrot as you , ' interposed the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 6]: ` He he he ! '
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 3]: cried Brass .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 7]: ` You have such spirits ! '
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 33]: The smoking sentinel at the door interposed in this place , and without taking his pipe from his lips , growled , ` Here 's the gal a comin ' down . '
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 8]: ` The what , you dog ? '
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 3]: said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 9]: ` The gal , ' returned the boy .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 6]: ` Are you deaf ? '
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 45]: said Quilp , drawing in his breath with great relish as if he were taking soup , ` you and I will have such a settling presently ; there 's such a scratching and bruising in store for you , my dear young friend !
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 2]: Aha !
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 2]: Nelly !
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 11]: How is he now , my duck of diamonds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 12]: ` He 's very bad , ' replied the weeping child .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 8]: ` What a pretty little Nell ! '
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 3]: cried Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 13]: ` Oh beautiful , sir , beautiful indeed , ' said Brass .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 5]: ` Quite charming . '
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 41]: ` Has she come to sit upon Quilp 's knee , ' said the dwarf , in what he meant to be a soothing tone , ` or is she going to bed in her own little room inside here ?
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 9]: Which is poor Nelly going to do ? '
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 12]: ` What a remarkable pleasant way he has with children ! '
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 27]: muttered Brass , as if in confidence between himself and the ceiling ; ` upon my word it 's quite a treat to hear him . '
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 15]: ` I 'm not going to stay at all , ' faltered Nell . '
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 25]: I want a few things out of that room , and then I -- I -- wo n't come down here any more . '
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 11]: ` And a very nice little room it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 11]: said the dwarf looking into it as the child entered .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 5]: ` Quite a bower !
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 23]: You 're sure you 're not going to use it ; you 're sure you 're not coming back , Nelly ? '
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 27]: ` No , ' replied the child , hurrying away , with the few articles of dress she had come to remove ; ` never again !
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 4]: Never again . '
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 14]: ` She 's very sensitive , ' said Quilp , looking after her .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 9]: ` Very sensitive ; that 's a pity .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 8]: The bedstead is much about my size .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 11]: I think I shall make it MY little room . '
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 28]: Mr Brass encouraging this idea , as he would have encouraged any other emanating from the same source , the dwarf walked in to try the effect .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 30]: This he did , by throwing himself on his back upon the bed with his pipe in his mouth , and then kicking up his legs and smoking violently .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 65]: Mr Brass applauding this picture very much , and the bed being soft and comfortable , Mr Quilp determined to use it , both as a sleeping place by night and as a kind of Divan by day ; and in order that it might be converted to the latter purpose at once , remained where he was , and smoked his pipe out .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 61]: The legal gentleman being by this time rather giddy and perplexed in his ideas -LRB- for this was one of the operations of the tobacco on his nervous system -RRB- , took the opportunity of slinking away into the open air , where , in course of time , he recovered sufficiently to return with a countenance of tolerable composure .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 30]: He was soon led on by the malicious dwarf to smoke himself into a relapse , and in that state stumbled upon a settee where he slept till morning .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 14]: Such were Mr Quilp 's first proceedings on entering upon his new property .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 62]: He was , for some days , restrained by business from performing any particular pranks , as his time was pretty well occupied between taking , with the assistance of Mr Brass , a minute inventory of all the goods in the place , and going abroad upon his other concerns which happily engaged him for several hours at a time .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 63]: His avarice and caution being , now , thoroughly awakened , however , he was never absent from the house one night ; and his eagerness for some termination , good or bad , to the old man 's disorder , increasing rapidly , as the time passed by , soon began to vent itself in open murmurs and exclamations of impatience .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 37]: Nell shrank timidly from all the dwarf 's advances towards conversation , and fled from the very sound of his voice ; nor were the lawyer 's smiles less terrible to her than Quilp 's grimaces .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 64]: She lived in such continual dread and apprehension of meeting one or other of them on the stairs or in the passages if she stirred from her grandfather 's chamber , that she seldom left it , for a moment , until late at night , when the silence encouraged her to venture forth and breathe the purer air of some empty room .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 43]: One night , she had stolen to her usual window , and was sitting there very sorrowfully -- for the old man had been worse that day -- when she thought she heard her name pronounced by a voice in the street .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 21]: Looking down , she recognised Kit , whose endeavours to attract her attention had roused her from her sad reflections .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 5]: ` Miss Nell ! '
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 8]: said the boy in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 37]: ` Yes , ' replied the child , doubtful whether she ought to hold any communication with the supposed culprit , but inclining to her old favourite still ; ` what do you want ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 37]: I have wanted to say a word to you , for a long time , ' the boy replied , ` but the people below have driven me away and would n't let me see you .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 32]: You do n't believe -- I hope you do n't really believe -- that I deserve to be cast off as I have been ; do you , miss ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 10]: I must believe it , ' returned the child .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 14]: ` Or why would grandfather have been so angry with you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 9]: I do n't know , ' replied Kit .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 17]: ` I 'm sure I never deserved it from him , no , nor from you .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 15]: I can say that , with a true and honest heart , any way .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 22]: And then to be driven from the door , when I only came to ask how old master was -- ! '
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 13]: ` They never told me that , ' said the child . '
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 7]: I did n't know it indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 13]: I would n't have had them do it for the world . '
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 21]: ` Thank ` ee , miss , ' returned Kit , ` it 's comfortable to hear you say that .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 13]: I said I never would believe that it was your doing . '
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 6]: ` That was right ! '
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 5]: said the child eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 28]: ` Miss Nell , ' cried the boy coming under the window , and speaking in a lower tone , ` there are new masters down stairs .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 8]: It 's a change for you . '
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 10]: ` It is indeed , ' replied the child .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 25]: ` And so it will be for him when he gets better , ' said the boy , pointing towards the sick room . '
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 17]: -- If he ever does , ' added the child , unable to restrain her tears .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 17]: ` Oh , he 'll do that , he 'll do that , ' said Kit .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 7]: ` I 'm sure he will .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 10]: You must n't be cast down , Miss Nell .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 8]: Now do n't be , pray ! '
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 29]: These words of encouragement and consolation were few and roughly said , but they affected the child and made her , for the moment , weep the more .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 47]: ` He 'll be sure to get better now , ' said the boy anxiously , ` if you do n't give way to low spirits and turn ill yourself , which would make him worse and throw him back , just as he was recovering .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 20]: When he does , say a good word -- say a kind word for me , Miss Nell ! '
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 47]: ` They tell me I must not even mention your name to him for a long , long time , ' rejoined the child , ' I dare not ; and even if I might , what good would a kind word do you , Kit ?
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 6]: We shall be very poor .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 9]: We shall scarcely have bread to eat . '
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 25]: ` It 's not that I may be taken back , ' said the boy , ` that I ask the favour of you .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 24]: It is n't for the sake of food and wages that I 've been waiting about so long in hopes to see you .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 21]: Do n't think that I 'd come in a time of trouble to talk of such things as them . '
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 17]: The child looked gratefully and kindly at him , but waited that he might speak again .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 22]: ` No , it 's not that , ' said Kit hesitating , ` it 's something very different from that .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 75]: I have n't got much sense , I know , but if he could be brought to believe that I 'd been a faithful servant to him , doing the best I could , and never meaning harm , perhaps he might n't -- ' Here Kit faltered so long that the child entreated him to speak out , and quickly , for it was very late , and time to shut the window .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 28]: ` Perhaps he might n't think it over venturesome of me to say -- well then , to say this , ' cried Kit with sudden boldness .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 10]: ` This home is gone from you and him .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 42]: Mother and I have got a poor one , but that 's better than this with all these people here ; and why not come there , till he 's had time to look about , and find a better ! '
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 6]: The child did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 27]: Kit , in the relief of having made his proposition , found his tongue loosened , and spoke out in its favour with his utmost eloquence .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 18]: ` You think , ' said the boy , ` that it 's very small and inconvenient .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 10]: So it is , but it 's very clean .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 22]: Perhaps you think it would be noisy , but there 's not a quieter court than ours in all the town .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 29]: Do n't be afraid of the children ; the baby hardly ever cries , and the other one is very good -- besides , I 'd mind 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 11]: They would n't vex you much , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 9]: Do try , Miss Nell , do try .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 10]: The little front room up stairs is very pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 53]: You can see a piece of the church-clock , through the chimneys , and almost tell the time ; mother says it would be just the thing for you , and so it would , and you 'd have her to wait upon you both , and me to run of errands .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 17]: We do n't mean money , bless you ; you 're not to think of that !
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 8]: Will you try him , Miss Nell ?
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 7]: Only say you 'll try him .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 17]: Do try to make old master come , and ask him first what I have done .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 10]: Will you only promise that , Miss Nell ? '
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 34]: Before the child could reply to this earnest solicitation , the street-door opened , and Mr Brass thrusting out his night-capped head called in a surly voice , ` Who 's there ! '
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 19]: Kit immediately glided away , and Nell , closing the window softly , drew back into the room .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 48]: Before Mr Brass had repeated his inquiry many times , Mr Quilp , also embellished with a night-cap , emerged from the same door and looked carefully up and down the street , and up at all the windows of the house , from the opposite side .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 88]: Finding that there was nobody in sight , he presently returned into the house with his legal friend , protesting -LRB- as the child heard from the staircase -RRB- , that there was a league and plot against him ; that he was in danger of being robbed and plundered by a band of conspirators who prowled about the house at all seasons ; and that he would delay no longer but take immediate steps for disposing of the property and returning to his own peaceful roof .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 36]: Having growled forth these , and a great many other threats of the same nature , he coiled himself once more in the child 's little bed , and Nell crept softly up the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 37]: It was natural enough that her short and unfinished dialogue with Kit should leave a strong impression on her mind , and influence her dreams that night and her recollections for a long , long time .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 68]: Surrounded by unfeeling creditors , and mercenary attendants upon the sick , and meeting in the height of her anxiety and sorrow with little regard or sympathy even from the women about her , it is not surprising that the affectionate heart of the child should have been touched to the quick by one kind and generous spirit , however uncouth the temple in which it dwelt .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 33]: Thank Heaven that the temples of such spirits are not made with hands , and that they may be even more worthily hung with poor patch-work than with purple and fine linen !
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 22]: Chapter 12 At length , the crisis of the old man 's disorder was past , and he began to mend .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 22]: By very slow and feeble degrees his consciousness came back ; but the mind was weakened and its functions were impaired .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 67]: He was patient , and quiet ; often sat brooding , but not despondently , for a long space ; was easily amused , even by a sun-beam on the wall or ceiling ; made no complaint that the days were long , or the nights tedious ; and appeared indeed to have lost all count of time , and every sense of care or weariness .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 65]: He would sit , for hours together , with Nell 's small hand in his , playing with the fingers and stopping sometimes to smooth her hair or kiss her brow ; and , when he saw that tears were glistening in her eyes , would look , amazed , about him for the cause , and forget his wonder even while he looked .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 21]: The child and he rode out ; the old man propped up with pillows , and the child beside him .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 8]: They were hand in hand as usual .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 28]: The noise and motion in the streets fatigued his brain at first , but he was not surprised , or curious , or pleased , or irritated .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 12]: He was asked if he remembered this , or that . '
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 15]: O yes , ' he said , ` quite well -- why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 45]: Sometimes he turned his head , and looked , with earnest gaze and outstretched neck , after some stranger in the crowd , until he disappeared from sight ; but , to the question why he did this , he answered not a word .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 30]: He was sitting in his easy chair one day , and Nell upon a stool beside him , when a man outside the door inquired if he might enter .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 17]: ` Yes , ' he said without emotion , ` it was Quilp , he knew .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 5]: Quilp was master there .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 8]: Of course he might come in . '
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 5]: And so he did .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 24]: ` I 'm glad to see you well again at last , neighbour , ' said the dwarf , sitting down opposite him .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 8]: ` You 're quite strong now ? '
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 15]: ` Yes , ' said the old man feebly , ` yes . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 52]: I do n't want to hurry you , you know , neighbour , ' said the dwarf , raising his voice , for the old man 's senses were duller than they had been ; ` but , as soon as you can arrange your future proceedings , the better . '
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 9]: ` Surely , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 8]: ` The better for all parties . '
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 30]: ` You see , ' pursued Quilp after a short pause , ` the goods being once removed , this house would be uncomfortable ; uninhabitable in fact . '
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 11]: ` You say true , ' returned the old man .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 11]: ` Poor Nell too , what would she do ? '
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 18]: ` Exactly , ' bawled the dwarf nodding his head ; ` that 's very well observed .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 11]: Then will you consider about it , neighbour ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 11]: I will , certainly , ' replied the old man .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 8]: ` We shall not stop here . '
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 11]: ` So I supposed , ' said the dwarf . '
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 6]: I have sold the things .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 20]: They have not yielded quite as much as they might have done , but pretty well -- pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 4]: To-day 's Tuesday .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 6]: When shall they be moved ?
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 12]: There 's no hurry -- shall we say this afternoon ? '
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 11]: ` Say Friday morning , ' returned the old man .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 9]: ` Very good , ' said the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 24]: ` So be it -- with the understanding that I ca n't go beyond that day , neighbour , on any account . '
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 10]: ` Good , ' returned the old man . '
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 6]: I shall remember it . '
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 34]: Mr Quilp seemed rather puzzled by the strange , even spiritless way in which all this was said ; but as the old man nodded his head and repeated ` on Friday morning .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 53]: I shall remember it , ' he had no excuse for dwelling on the subject any further , and so took a friendly leave with many expressions of good-will and many compliments to his friend on his looking so remarkably well ; and went below stairs to report progress to Mr Brass .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 17]: All that day , and all the next , the old man remained in this state .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 54]: He wandered up and down the house and into and out of the various rooms , as if with some vague intent of bidding them adieu , but he referred neither by direct allusions nor in any other manner to the interview of the morning or the necessity of finding some other shelter .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 72]: An indistinct idea he had , that the child was desolate and in want of help ; for he often drew her to his bosom and bade her be of good cheer , saying that they would not desert each other ; but he seemed unable to contemplate their real position more distinctly , and was still the listless , passionless creature that suffering of mind and body had left him .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 25]: We call this a state of childishness , but it is the same poor hollow mockery of it , that death is of sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 49]: Where , in the dull eyes of doating men , are the laughing light and life of childhood , the gaiety that has known no check , the frankness that has felt no chill , the hope that has never withered , the joys that fade in blossoming ?
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 42]: Where , in the sharp lineaments of rigid and unsightly death , is the calm beauty of slumber , telling of rest for the waking hours that are past , and gentle hopes and loves for those which are to come ?
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 19]: Lay death and sleep down , side by side , and say who shall find the two akin .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 33]: Send forth the child and childish man together , and blush for the pride that libels our own old happy state , and gives its title to an ugly and distorted image .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 13]: Thursday arrived , and there was no alteration in the old man .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 17]: But a change came upon him that evening as he and the child sat silently together .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 43]: In a small dull yard below his window , there was a tree -- green and flourishing enough , for such a place -- and as the air stirred among its leaves , it threw a rippling shadow on the white wall .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 43]: The old man sat watching the shadows as they trembled in this patch of light , until the sun went down ; and when it was night , and the moon was slowly rising , he still sat in the same spot .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 35]: To one who had been tossing on a restless bed so long , even these few green leaves and this tranquil light , although it languished among chimneys and house-tops , were pleasant things .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 13]: They suggested quiet places afar off , and rest , and peace .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 18]: The child thought , more than once that he was moved : and had forborne to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 33]: But now he shed tears -- tears that it lightened her aching heart to see -- and making as though he would fall upon his knees , besought her to forgive him .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 7]: ` Forgive you -- what ? '
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 9]: said Nell , interposing to prevent his purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 10]: ` Oh grandfather , what should I forgive ? '
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 30]: ` All that is past , all that has come upon thee , Nell , all that was done in that uneasy dream , ' returned the old man .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 11]: ` Do not talk so , ' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 5]: ` Pray do not .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 8]: Let us speak of something else . '
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 12]: ` Yes , yes , we will , ' he rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 26]: ` And it shall be of what we talked of long ago -- many months -- months is it , or weeks , or days ?
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 7]: which is it Nell ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 11]: I do not understand you , ' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 21]: ` It has come back upon me to-day , it has all come back since we have been sitting here .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 9]: I bless thee for it , Nell ! '
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 8]: ` For what , dear grandfather ? '
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 14]: ` For what you said when we were first made beggars , Nell .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 5]: Let us speak softly .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 22]: for if they knew our purpose down stairs , they would cry that I was mad and take thee from me .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 8]: We will not stop here another day .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 9]: We will go far away from here . '
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 13]: ` Yes , let us go , ' said the child earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 18]: ` Let us begone from this place , and never turn back or think of it again .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 14]: Let us wander barefoot through the world , rather than linger here . '
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 40]: ` We will , ' answered the old man , ` we will travel afoot through the fields and woods , and by the side of rivers , and trust ourselves to God in the places where He dwells .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 39]: It is far better to lie down at night beneath an open sky like that yonder -- see how bright it is -- than to rest in close rooms which are always full of care and weary dreams .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 29]: Thou and I together , Nell , may be cheerful and happy yet , and learn to forget this time , as if it had never been . '
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 11]: ` We will be happy , ' cried the child .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 8]: ` We never can be here . '
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 22]: ` No , we never can again -- never again -- that 's truly said , ' rejoined the old man .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 33]: ` Let us steal away to-morrow morning -- early and softly , that we may not be seen or heard -- and leave no trace or track for them to follow by .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 3]: Poor Nell !
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 40]: Thy cheek is pale , and thy eyes are heavy with watching and weeping for me -- I know -- for me ; but thou wilt be well again , and merry too , when we are far away .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 27]: To-morrow morning , dear , we 'll turn our faces from this scene of sorrow , and be as free and happy as the birds . '
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 48]: And then the old man clasped his hands above her head , and said , in a few broken words , that from that time forth they would wander up and down together , and never part more until Death took one or other of the twain .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 11]: The child 's heart beat high with hope and confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 16]: She had no thought of hunger , or cold , or thirst , or suffering .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 66]: She saw in this , but a return of the simple pleasures they had once enjoyed , a relief from the gloomy solitude in which she had lived , an escape from the heartless people by whom she had been surrounded in her late time of trial , the restoration of the old man 's health and peace , and a life of tranquil happiness .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 30]: Sun , and stream , and meadow , and summer days , shone brightly in her view , and there was no dark tint in all the sparkling picture .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 27]: The old man had slept , for some hours , soundly in his bed , and she was yet busily engaged in preparing for their flight .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 48]: There were a few articles of clothing for herself to carry , and a few for him ; old garments , such as became their fallen fortunes , laid out to wear ; and a staff to support his feeble steps , put ready for his use .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 21]: But this was not all her task ; for now she must visit the old rooms for the last time .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 29]: And how different the parting with them was , from any she had expected , and most of all from that which she had oftenest pictured to herself .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 51]: How could she ever have thought of bidding them farewell in triumph , when the recollection of the many hours she had passed among them rose to her swelling heart , and made her feel the wish a cruelty : lonely and sad though many of those hours had been !
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 53]: She sat down at the window where she had spent so many evenings -- darker far than this -- and every thought of hope or cheerfulness that had occurred to her in that place came vividly upon her mind , and blotted out all its dull and mournful associations in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 45]: Her own little room too , where she had so often knelt down and prayed at night -- prayed for the time which she hoped was dawning now -- the little room where she had slept so peacefully , and dreamed such pleasant dreams !
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 29]: It was hard not to be able to glance round it once more , and to be forced to leave it without one kind look or grateful tear .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 24]: There were some trifles there -- poor useless things -- that she would have liked to take away ; but that was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 16]: This brought to mind her bird , her poor bird , who hung there yet .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 86]: She wept bitterly for the loss of this little creature -- until the idea occurred to her -- she did not know how , or why , it came into her head -- that it might , by some means , fall into the hands of Kit who would keep it for her sake , and think , perhaps , that she had left it behind in the hope that he might have it , and as an assurance that she was grateful to him .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 18]: She was calmed and comforted by the thought , and went to rest with a lighter heart .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 45]: From many dreams of rambling through light and sunny places , but with some vague object unattained which ran indistinctly through them all , she awoke to find that it was yet night , and that the stars were shining brightly in the sky .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 18]: At length , the day began to glimmer , and the stars to grow pale and dim .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 19]: As soon as she was sure of this , she arose , and dressed herself for the journey .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 28]: The old man was yet asleep , and as she was unwilling to disturb him , she left him to slumber on , until the sun rose .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 22]: He was anxious that they should leave the house without a minute 's loss of time , and was soon ready .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 31]: The child then took him by the hand , and they trod lightly and cautiously down the stairs , trembling whenever a board creaked , and often stopping to listen .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 34]: The old man had forgotten a kind of wallet which contained the light burden he had to carry ; and the going back a few steps to fetch it seemed an interminable delay .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 33]: At last they reached the passage on the ground floor , where the snoring of Mr Quilp and his legal friend sounded more terrible in their ears than the roars of lions .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 15]: The bolts of the door were rusty , and difficult to unfasten without noise .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 24]: When they were all drawn back , it was found to be locked , and worst of all , the key was gone .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 38]: Then the child remembered , for the first time , one of the nurses having told her that Quilp always locked both the house-doors at night , and kept the keys on the table in his bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 51]: It was not without great fear and trepidation that little Nell slipped off her shoes and gliding through the store-room of old curiosities , where Mr Brass -- the ugliest piece of goods in all the stock -- lay sleeping on a mattress , passed into her own little chamber .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 84]: Here she stood , for a few moments , quite transfixed with terror at the sight of Mr Quilp , who was hanging so far out of bed that he almost seemed to be standing on his head , and who , either from the uneasiness of this posture , or in one of his agreeable habits , was gasping and growling with his mouth wide open , and the whites -LRB- or rather the dirty yellows -RRB- of his eyes distinctly visible .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 44]: It was no time , however , to ask whether anything ailed him ; so , possessing herself of the key after one hasty glance about the room , and repassing the prostrate Mr Brass , she rejoined the old man in safety .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 17]: They got the door open without noise , and passing into the street , stood still .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 5]: ` Which way ? '
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 4]: said the child .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 30]: The old man looked , irresolutely and helplessly , first at her , then to the right and left , then at her again , and shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 12]: It was plain that she was thenceforth his guide and leader .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 24]: The child felt it , but had no doubts or misgiving , and putting her hand in his , led him gently away .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 25]: It was the beginning of a day in June ; the deep blue sky unsullied by a cloud , and teeming with brilliant light .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 36]: The streets were , as yet , nearly free from passengers , the houses and shops were closed , and the healthy air of morning fell like breath from angels , on the sleeping town .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 19]: The old man and the child passed on through the glad silence , elate with hope and pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 79]: They were alone together , once again ; every object was bright and fresh ; nothing reminded them , otherwise than by contrast , of the monotony and constraint they had left behind ; church towers and steeples , frowning and dark at other times , now shone in the sun ; each humble nook and corner rejoiced in light ; and the sky , dimmed only by excessive distance , shed its placid smile on everything beneath .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 22]: Forth from the city , while it yet slumbered , went the two poor adventurers , wandering they knew not whither .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 150]: Chapter 13 Daniel Quilp of Tower Hill , and Sampson Brass of Bevis Marks in the city of London , Gentleman , one of her Majesty 's attornies of the Courts of the King 's Bench and Common Pleas at Westminster and a solicitor of the High Court of Chancery , slumbered on , unconscious and unsuspicious of any mischance , until a knocking on the street door , often repeated and gradually mounting up from a modest single rap to a perfect battery of knocks , fired in long discharges with a very short interval between , caused the said Daniel Quilp to struggle into a horizontal position , and to stare at the ceiling with a drowsy indifference , betokening that he heard the noise and rather wondered at the same , and could n't be at the trouble of bestowing any further thought upon the subject .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 90]: As the knocking , however , instead of accommodating itself to his lazy state , increased in vigour and became more importunate , as if in earnest remonstrance against his falling asleep again , now that he had once opened his eyes , Daniel Quilp began by degrees to comprehend the possibility of there being somebody at the door ; and thus he gradually came to recollect that it was Friday morning , and he had ordered Mrs Quilp to be in waiting upon him at an early hour .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 46]: Mr Brass , after writhing about , in a great many strange attitudes , and often twisting his face and eyes into an expression like that which is usually produced by eating gooseberries very early in the season , was by this time awake also .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 67]: Seeing that Mr Quilp invested himself in his every-day garments , he hastened to do the like , putting on his shoes before his stockings , and thrusting his legs into his coat sleeves , and making such other small mistakes in his toilet as are not uncommon to those who dress in a hurry , and labour under the agitation of having been suddenly roused .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 48]: While the attorney was thus engaged , the dwarf was groping under the table , muttering desperate imprecations on himself , and mankind in general , and all inanimate objects to boot , which suggested to Mr Brass the question , ` what 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 23]: ` The key , ' said the dwarf , looking viciously about him , ` the door-key -- that 's the matter .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 7]: D'ye know anything of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 12]: ` How should I know anything of it , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 4]: returned Mr Brass .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 6]: ` How should you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 6]: repeated Quilp with a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 11]: ` You 're a nice lawyer , a n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 6]: Ugh , you idiot ! '
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 65]: Not caring to represent to the dwarf in his present humour , that the loss of a key by another person could scarcely be said to affect his -LRB- Brass 's -RRB- legal knowledge in any material degree , Mr Brass humbly suggested that it must have been forgotten over night , and was , doubtless , at that moment in its native key-hole .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 49]: Notwithstanding that Mr Quilp had a strong conviction to the contrary , founded on his recollection of having carefully taken it out , he was fain to admit that this was possible , and therefore went grumbling to the door where , sure enough , he found it .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 54]: Now , just as Mr Quilp laid his hand upon the lock , and saw with great astonishment that the fastenings were undone , the knocking came again with the most irritating violence , and the daylight which had been shining through the key-hole was intercepted on the outside by a human eye .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 39]: The dwarf was very much exasperated , and wanting somebody to wreak his ill-humour upon , determined to dart out suddenly , and favour Mrs Quilp with a gentle acknowledgment of her attention in making that hideous uproar .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 72]: With this view , he drew back the lock very silently and softly , and opening the door all at once , pounced out upon the person on the other side , who had at that moment raised the knocker for another application , and at whom the dwarf ran head first : throwing out his hands and feet together , and biting the air in the fulness of his malice .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 92]: So far , however , from rushing upon somebody who offered no resistance and implored his mercy , Mr Quilp was no sooner in the arms of the individual whom he had taken for his wife than he found himself complimented with two staggering blows on the head , and two more , of the same quality , in the chest ; and closing with his assailant , such a shower of buffets rained down upon his person as sufficed to convince him that he was in skilful and experienced hands .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 38]: Nothing daunted by this reception , he clung tight to his opponent , and bit and hammered away with such good-will and heartiness , that it was at least a couple of minutes before he was dislodged .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 47]: Then , and not until then , Daniel Quilp found himself , all flushed and dishevelled , in the middle of the street , with Mr Richard Swiveller performing a kind of dance round him and requiring to know ` whether he wanted any more ? '
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 67]: ` There 's plenty more of it at the same shop , ' said Mr Swiveller , by turns advancing and retreating in a threatening attitude , ' a large and extensive assortment always on hand -- country orders executed with promptitude and despatch -- will you have a little more , Sir -- do n't say no , if you 'd rather not . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 26]: I thought it was somebody else , ' said Quilp , rubbing his shoulders , ` why did n't you say who you were ? '
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 11]: ` Why did n't you say who YOU were ? '
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 16]: returned Dick , ` instead of flying out of the house like a Bedlamite ? '
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 26]: ` It was you that -- that knocked , ' said the dwarf , getting up with a short groan , ` was it ? '
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 12]: ` Yes , I am the man , ' replied Dick .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 21]: ` That lady had begun when I came , but she knocked too soft , so I relieved her . '
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 19]: As he said this , he pointed towards Mrs Quilp , who stood trembling at a little distance .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 4]: ` Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 20]: muttered the dwarf , darting an angry look at his wife , ' I thought it was your fault !
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 29]: And you , sir -- do n't you know there has been somebody ill here , that you knock as if you 'd beat the door down ? '
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 4]: ` Damme ! '
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 11]: answered Dick , ` that 's why I did it .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 9]: I thought there was somebody dead here . '
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 14]: ` You came for some purpose , I suppose , ' said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 9]: ` What is it you want ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 34]: I want to know how the old gentleman is , ' rejoined Mr Swiveller , ` and to hear from Nell herself , with whom I should like to have a little talk .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 30]: I 'm a friend of the family , sir -- at least I 'm the friend of one of the family , and that 's the same thing . '
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 13]: ` You 'd better walk in then , ' said the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 9]: ` Go on , sir , go on .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 11]: Now , Mrs Quilp -- after you , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 9]: Mrs Quilp hesitated , but Mr Quilp insisted .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 66]: And it was not a contest of politeness , or by any means a matter of form , for she knew very well that her husband wished to enter the house in this order , that he might have a favourable opportunity of inflicting a few pinches on her arms , which were seldom free from impressions of his fingers in black and blue colours .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 50]: Mr Swiveller , who was not in the secret , was a little surprised to hear a suppressed scream , and , looking round , to see Mrs Quilp following him with a sudden jerk ; but he did not remark on these appearances , and soon forgot them .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 41]: ` Now , Mrs Quilp , ' said the dwarf when they had entered the shop , ` go you up stairs , if you please , to Nelly 's room , and tell her that she 's wanted . '
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 24]: ` You seem to make yourself at home here , ' said Dick , who was unacquainted with Mr Quilp 's authority . '
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 13]: I AM at home , young gentleman , ' returned the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 37]: Dick was pondering what these words might mean , and still more what the presence of Mr Brass might mean , when Mrs Quilp came hurrying down stairs , declaring that the rooms above were empty .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 7]: 'Em pty , you fool ! '
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 5]: said the dwarf . '
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 34]: I give you my word , Quilp , ' answered his trembling wife , ` that I have been into every room and there 's not a soul in any of them . '
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 27]: ` And that , ' said Mr Brass , clapping his hands once , with an emphasis , ` explains the mystery of the key ! '
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 48]: Quilp looked frowningly at him , and frowningly at his wife , and frowningly at Richard Swiveller ; but , receiving no enlightenment from any of them , hurried up stairs , whence he soon hurried down again , confirming the report which had already been made .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 36]: ` It 's a strange way of going , ' he said , glancing at Swiveller , ` very strange not to communicate with me who am such a close and intimate friend of his !
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 26]: he 'll write to me no doubt , or he 'll bid Nelly write -- yes , yes , that 's what he 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 7]: Nelly 's very fond of me .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 4]: Pretty Nell ! '
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 12]: Mr Swiveller looked , as he was , all open-mouthed astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 30]: Still glancing furtively at him , Quilp turned to Mr Brass and observed , with assumed carelessness , that this need not interfere with the removal of the goods .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 31]: ` For indeed , ' he added , ` we knew that they 'd go away to-day , but not that they 'd go so early , or so quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 12]: But they have their reasons , they have their reasons . '
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 12]: ` Where in the devil 's name are they gone ? '
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 5]: said the wondering Dick .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 30]: Quilp shook his head , and pursed up his lips , in a manner which implied that he knew very well , but was not at liberty to say .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 26]: ` And what , ' said Dick , looking at the confusion about him , ` what do you mean by moving the goods ? '
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 13]: ` That I have bought 'em , Sir , ' rejoined Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 3]: ` Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 4]: What then ? '
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 33]: ` Has the sly old fox made his fortune then , and gone to live in a tranquil cot in a pleasant spot with a distant view of the changing sea ? '
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 7]: said Dick , in great bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 28]: ` Keeping his place of retirement very close , that he may not be visited too often by affectionate grandsons and their devoted friends , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 21]: added the dwarf , rubbing his hands hard ; ' I say nothing , but is that your meaning ? '
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 39]: Richard Swiveller was utterly aghast at this unexpected alteration of circumstances , which threatened the complete overthrow of the project in which he bore so conspicuous a part , and seemed to nip his prospects in the bud .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 54]: Having only received from Frederick Trent , late on the previous night , information of the old man 's illness , he had come upon a visit of condolence and inquiry to Nell , prepared with the first instalment of that long train of fascinations which was to fire her heart at last .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 79]: And here , when he had been thinking of all kinds of graceful and insinuating approaches , and meditating on the fearful retaliation which was slowly working against Sophy Wackles -- here were Nell , the old man , and all the money gone , melted away , decamped he knew not whither , as if with a fore-knowledge of the scheme and a resolution to defeat it in the very outset , before a step was taken .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 20]: In his secret heart , Daniel Quilp was both surprised and troubled by the flight which had been made .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 52]: It had not escaped his keen eye that some indispensable articles of clothing were gone with the fugitives , and knowing the old man 's weak state of mind , he marvelled what that course of proceeding might be in which he had so readily procured the concurrence of the child .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 30]: It must not be supposed -LRB- or it would be a gross injustice to Mr Quilp -RRB- that he was tortured by any disinterested anxiety on behalf of either .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 38]: His uneasiness arose from a misgiving that the old man had some secret store of money which he had not suspected ; and the idea of its escaping his clutches , overwhelmed him with mortification and self-reproach .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 32]: In this frame of mind , it was some consolation to him to find that Richard Swiveller was , for different reasons , evidently irritated and disappointed by the same cause .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 45]: It was plain , thought the dwarf , that he had come there , on behalf of his friend , to cajole or frighten the old man out of some small fraction of that wealth of which they supposed him to have an abundance .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 37]: Therefore , it was a relief to vex his heart with a picture of the riches the old man hoarded , and to expatiate on his cunning in removing himself even beyond the reach of importunity .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 25]: ` Well , ' said Dick , with a blank look , ' I suppose it 's of no use my staying here . '
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 13]: ` Not the least in the world , ' rejoined the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 11]: ` You 'll mention that I called , perhaps ? '
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 18]: Mr Quilp nodded , and said he certainly would , the very first time he saw them .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 58]: ` And say , ' added Mr Swiveller , ` say , sir , that I was wafted here upon the pinions of concord ; that I came to remove , with the rake of friendship , the seeds of mutual violence and heart-burning , and to sow in their place , the germs of social harmony .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 15]: Will you have the goodness to charge yourself with that commission , Sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 4]: ` Certainly ! '
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 3]: rejoined Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 43]: ` Will you be kind enough to add to it , Sir , ' said Dick , producing a very small limp card , ` that that is my address , and that I am to be found at home every morning .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 14]: Two distinct knocks , sir , will produce the slavey at any time .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 39]: My particular friends , Sir , are accustomed to sneeze when the door is opened , to give her to understand that they ARE my friends and have no interested motives in asking if I 'm at home .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 17]: I beg your pardon ; will you allow me to look at that card again ? '
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 8]: by all means , ' rejoined Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 48]: ` By a slight and not unnatural mistake , sir , ' said Dick , substituting another in its stead , ' I had handed you the pass-ticket of a select convivial circle called the Glorious Apollers of which I have the honour to be Perpetual Grand .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 8]: That is the proper document , Sir .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 4]: Good morning . '
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 41]: Quilp bade him good day ; the perpetual Grand Master of the Glorious Apollers , elevating his hat in honour of Mrs Quilp , dropped it carelessly on the side of his head again , and disappeared with a flourish .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 46]: By this time , certain vans had arrived for the conveyance of the goods , and divers strong men in caps were balancing chests of drawers and other trifles of that nature upon their heads , and performing muscular feats which heightened their complexions considerably .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 108]: Not to be behind-hand in the bustle , Mr Quilp went to work with surprising vigour ; hustling and driving the people about , like an evil spirit ; setting Mrs Quilp upon all kinds of arduous and impracticable tasks ; carrying great weights up and down , with no apparent effort ; kicking the boy from the wharf , whenever he could get near him ; and inflicting , with his loads , a great many sly bumps and blows on the shoulders of Mr Brass , as he stood upon the door-steps to answer all the inquiries of curious neighbours , which was his department .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 40]: His presence and example diffused such alacrity among the persons employed , that , in a few hours , the house was emptied of everything , but pieces of matting , empty porter-pots , and scattered fragments of straw .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 51]: Seated , like an African chief , on one of these pieces of matting , the dwarf was regaling himself in the parlour , with bread and cheese and beer , when he observed without appearing to do so , that a boy was prying in at the outer door .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 33]: Assured that it was Kit , though he saw little more than his nose , Mr Quilp hailed him by his name ; whereupon Kit came in and demanded what he wanted .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 12]: ` Come here , you sir , ' said the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 14]: ` Well , so your old master and young mistress have gone ? '
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 4]: ` Where ? '
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 6]: rejoined Kit , looking round .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 13]: ` Do you mean to say you do n't know where ? '
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 4]: answered Quilp sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 10]: ` Where have they gone , eh ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 9]: I do n't know , ' said Kit .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 16]: ` Come , ' retorted Quilp , ` let 's have no more of this !
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 26]: Do you mean to say that you do n't know they went away by stealth , as soon as it was light this morning ? '
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 12]: ` No , ' said the boy , in evident surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 8]: ` You do n't know that ? '
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 3]: cried Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 22]: ` Do n't I know that you were hanging about the house the other night , like a thief , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 7]: Were n't you told then ? '
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 8]: ` No , ' replied the boy .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 6]: ` You were not ? '
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 3]: said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 14]: ` What were you told then ; what were you talking about ? '
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 35]: Kit , who knew no particular reason why he should keep the matter secret now , related the purpose for which he had come on that occasion , and the proposal he had made .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 8]: said the dwarf after a little consideration .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 13]: ` Then , I think they 'll come to you yet . '
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 8]: ` Do you think they will ? '
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 4]: cried Kit eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 13]: ` Aye , I think they will , ' returned the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 14]: ` Now , when they do , let me know ; d'ye hear ?
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 11]: Let me know , and I 'll give you something .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 23]: I want to do 'em a kindness , and I ca n't do 'em a kindness unless I know where they are .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 7]: You hear what I say ? '
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 56]: Kit might have returned some answer which would not have been agreeable to his irascible questioner , if the boy from the wharf , who had been skulking about the room in search of anything that might have been left about by accident , had not happened to cry , ` Here 's a bird !
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 9]: What 's to be done with this ? '
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 9]: ` Wring its neck , ' rejoined Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 16]: ` Oh no , do n't do that , ' said Kit , stepping forward .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 7]: ` Give it to me . '
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 14]: ` Oh yes , I dare say , ' cried the other boy .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 3]: ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 15]: You let the cage alone , and let me wring its neck will you ?
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 8]: He said I was to do it .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 9]: You let the cage alone will you . '
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 17]: ` Give it here , give it to me , you dogs , ' roared Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 17]: ` Fight for it , you dogs , or I 'll wring its neck myself ! '
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 51]: Without further persuasion , the two boys fell upon each other , tooth and nail , while Quilp , holding up the cage in one hand , and chopping the ground with his knife in an ecstasy , urged them on by his taunts and cries to fight more fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 59]: They were a pretty equal match , and rolled about together , exchanging blows which were by no means child 's play , until at length Kit , planting a well-directed hit in his adversary 's chest , disengaged himself , sprung nimbly up , and snatching the cage from Quilp 's hands made off with his prize .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 27]: He did not stop once until he reached home , where his bleeding face occasioned great consternation , and caused the elder child to howl dreadfully .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 18]: ` Goodness gracious , Kit , what is the matter , what have you been doing ? '
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 4]: cried Mrs Nubbles .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 22]: ` Never you mind , mother , ' answered her son , wiping his face on the jack-towel behind the door .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 14]: ` I 'm not hurt , do n't you be afraid for me .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 17]: I 've been a fightin ' for a bird and won him , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 7]: Hold your noise , little Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 13]: I never see such a naughty boy in all my days ! '
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 10]: ` You have been fighting for a bird ! '
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 4]: exclaimed his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 7]: Fightin ' for a bird ! '
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 27]: replied Kit , ` and here he is -- Miss Nelly 's bird , mother , that they was agoin ' to wring the neck of !
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 9]: I stopped that though -- ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 14]: They would n't wring his neck and me by , no , no .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 14]: It would n't do , mother , it would n't do at all .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 5]: Ha ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 28]: Kit laughing so heartily , with his swoln and bruised face looking out of the towel , made little Jacob laugh , and then his mother laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 37]: and then the baby crowed and kicked with great glee , and then they all laughed in concert : partly because of Kit 's triumph , and partly because they were very fond of each other .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 54]: When this fit was over , Kit exhibited the bird to both children , as a great and precious rarity -- it was only a poor linnet -- and looking about the wall for an old nail , made a scaffolding of a chair and table and twisted it out with great exultation .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 44]: ` Let me see , ' said the boy , ' I think I 'll hang him in the winder , because it 's more light and cheerful , and he can see the sky there , if he looks up very much .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 14]: He 's such a one to sing , I can tell you ! '
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 39]: So , the scaffolding was made again , and Kit , climbing up with the poker for a hammer , knocked in the nail and hung up the cage , to the immeasurable delight of the whole family .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 34]: When it had been adjusted and straightened a great many times , and he had walked backwards into the fire-place in his admiration of it , the arrangement was pronounced to be perfect .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 55]: ` And now , mother , ' said the boy , ` before I rest any more , I 'll go out and see if I can find a horse to hold , and then I can buy some birdseed , and a bit of something nice for you , into the bargain . '
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 63]: Chapter 14 As it was very easy for Kit to persuade himself that the old house was in his way , his way being anywhere , he tried to look upon his passing it once more as a matter of imperative and disagreeable necessity , quite apart from any desire of his own , to which he could not choose but yield .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 47]: It is not uncommon for people who are much better fed and taught than Christopher Nubbles had ever been , to make duties of their inclinations in matters of more doubtful propriety , and to take great credit for the self-denial with which they gratify themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 30]: There was no need of any caution this time , and no fear of being detained by having to play out a return match with Daniel Quilp 's boy .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 21]: The place was entirely deserted , and looked as dusty and dingy as if it had been so for months .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 43]: A rusty padlock was fastened on the door , ends of discoloured blinds and curtains flapped drearily against the half-opened upper windows , and the crooked holes cut in the closed shutters below , were black with the darkness of the inside .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 35]: Some of the glass in the window he had so often watched , had been broken in the rough hurry of the morning , and that room looked more deserted and dull than any .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 75]: A group of idle urchins had taken possession of the door-steps ; some were plying the knocker and listening with delighted dread to the hollow sounds it spread through the dismantled house ; others were clustered about the keyhole , watching half in jest and half in earnest for ` the ghost , ' which an hour 's gloom , added to the mystery that hung about the late inhabitants , had already raised .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 60]: Standing all alone in the midst of the business and bustle of the street , the house looked a picture of cold desolation ; and Kit , who remembered the cheerful fire that used to burn there on a winter 's night and the no less cheerful laugh that made the small room ring , turned quite mournfully away .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 33]: It must be especially observed in justice to poor Kit that he was by no means of a sentimental turn , and perhaps had never heard that adjective in all his life .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 76]: He was only a soft-hearted grateful fellow , and had nothing genteel or polite about him ; consequently , instead of going home again , in his grief , to kick the children and abuse his mother -LRB- for , when your finely strung people are out of sorts , they must have everybody else unhappy likewise -RRB- , he turned his thoughts to the vulgar expedient of making them more comfortable if he could .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 27]: Bless us , what a number of gentlemen on horseback there were riding up and down , and how few of them wanted their horses held !
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 44]: A good city speculator or a parliamentary commissioner could have told to a fraction , from the crowds that were cantering about , what sum of money was realised in London , in the course of a year , by holding horses alone .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 52]: And undoubtedly it would have been a very large one , if only a twentieth part of the gentlemen without grooms had had occasion to alight ; but they had not ; and it is often an ill-natured circumstance like this , which spoils the most ingenious estimate in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 65]: Kit walked about , now with quick steps and now with slow ; now lingering as some rider slackened his horse 's pace and looked about him ; and now darting at full speed up a bye-street as he caught a glimpse of some distant horseman going lazily up the shady side of the road , and promising to stop , at every door .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 19]: But on they all went , one after another , and there was not a penny stirring . '
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 49]: I wonder , ' thought the boy , ` if one of these gentlemen knew there was nothing in the cupboard at home , whether he 'd stop on purpose , and make believe that he wanted to call somewhere , that I might earn a trifle ? '
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 57]: He was quite tired out with pacing the streets , to say nothing of repeated disappointments , and was sitting down upon a step to rest , when there approached towards him a little clattering jingling four-wheeled chaise ' drawn by a little obstinate-looking rough-coated pony , and driven by a little fat placid-faced old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 38]: Beside the little old gentleman sat a little old lady , plump and placid like himself , and the pony was coming along at his own pace and doing exactly as he pleased with the whole concern .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 18]: If the old gentleman remonstrated by shaking the reins , the pony replied by shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 54]: It was plain that the utmost the pony would consent to do , was to go in his own way up any street that the old gentleman particularly wished to traverse , but that it was an understanding between them that he must do this after his own fashion or not at all .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 24]: As they passed where he sat , Kit looked so wistfully at the little turn-out , that the old gentleman looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 43]: Kit rising and putting his hand to his hat , the old gentleman intimated to the pony that he wished to stop , to which proposal the pony -LRB- who seldom objected to that part of his duty -RRB- graciously acceded . '
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 11]: I beg your pardon , sir , ' said Kit .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 9]: ` I 'm sorry you stopped , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 11]: I only meant did you want your horse minded . '
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 18]: ` I 'm going to get down in the next street , ' returned the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 17]: ` If you like to come on after us , you may have the job . '
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 8]: Kit thanked him , and joyfully obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 35]: The pony ran off at a sharp angle to inspect a lamp-post on the opposite side of the way , and then went off at a tangent to another lamp-post on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 23]: Having satisfied himself that they were of the same pattern and materials , he came to a stop apparently absorbed in meditation .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 35]: ` Will you go on , sir , ' said the old gentleman , gravely , ` or are we to wait here for you till it 's too late for our appointment ? '
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 5]: The pony remained immoveable .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 12]: ` Oh you naughty Whisker , ' said the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 5]: ` Fie upon you !
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 8]: I 'm ashamed of such conduct . '
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 49]: The pony appeared to be touched by this appeal to his feelings , for he trotted on directly , though in a sulky manner , and stopped no more until he came to a door whereon was a brass plate with the words ` Witherden -- Notary . '
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 37]: Here the old gentleman got out and helped out the old lady , and then took from under the seat a nosegay resembling in shape and dimensions a full-sized warming-pan with the handle cut short off .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 31]: This , the old lady carried into the house with a staid and stately air , and the old gentleman -LRB- who had a club-foot -RRB- followed close upon her .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 30]: They went , as it was easy to tell from the sound of their voices , into the front parlour , which seemed to be a kind of office .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 33]: The day being very warm and the street a quiet one , the windows were wide open ; and it was easy to hear through the Venetian blinds all that passed inside .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 54]: At first there was a great shaking of hands and shuffling of feet , succeeded by the presentation of the nosegay ; for a voice , supposed by the listener to be that of Mr Witherden the Notary , was heard to exclaim a great many times , ` oh , delicious ! '
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 8]: ` oh , fragrant , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 28]: and a nose , also supposed to be the property of that gentleman , was heard to inhale the scent with a snuffle of exceeding pleasure . '
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 17]: I brought it in honour of the occasion , Sir , ' said the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 29]: an occasion indeed , ma'am , an occasion which does honour to me , ma'am , honour to me , ' rejoined Mr Witherden , the notary . '
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 16]: I have had many a gentleman articled to me , ma'am , many a one .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 103]: Some of them are now rolling in riches , unmindful of their old companion and friend , ma'am , others are in the habit of calling upon me to this day and saying , `` Mr Witherden , some of the pleasantest hours I ever spent in my life were spent in this office -- were spent , Sir , upon this very stool '' ; but there was never one among the number , ma'am , attached as I have been to many of them , of whom I augured such bright things as I do of your only son . '
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 5]: ` Oh dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 5]: said the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 19]: ` How happy you do make us when you tell us that , to be sure ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 34]: I tell you , ma'am , ' said Mr Witherden , ` what I think as an honest man , which , as the poet observes , is the noblest work of God .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 11]: I agree with the poet in every particular , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 35]: The mountainous Alps on the one hand , or a humming-bird on the other , is nothing , in point of workmanship , to an honest man -- or woman -- or woman . '
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 33]: ` Anything that Mr Witherden can say of me , ' observed a small quiet voice , ' I can say , with interest , of him , I am sure . '
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 36]: ` It 's a happy circumstance , a truly happy circumstance , ' said the Notary , ` to happen too upon his eight-and-twentieth birthday , and I hope I know how to appreciate it .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 23]: I trust , Mr Garland , my dear Sir , that we may mutually congratulate each other upon this auspicious occasion . '
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 13]: To this the old gentleman replied that he felt assured they might .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 52]: There appeared to be another shaking of hands in consequence , and when it was over , the old gentleman said that , though he said it who should not , he believed no son had ever been a greater comfort to his parents than Abel Garland had been to his .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 70]: ` Marrying as his mother and I did , late in life , sir , after waiting for a great many years , until we were well enough off -- coming together when we were no longer young , and then being blessed with one child who has always been dutiful and affectionate -- why , it 's a source of great happiness to us both , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 22]: ` Of course it is , I have no doubt of it , ' returned the Notary in a sympathising voice .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 22]: ` It 's the contemplation of this sort of thing , that makes me deplore my fate in being a bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 26]: There was a young lady once , sir , the daughter of an outfitting warehouse of the first respectability -- but that 's a weakness .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 10]: Chuckster , bring in Mr Abel 's articles . '
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 28]: ` You see , Mr Witherden , ' said the old lady , ` that Abel has not been brought up like the run of young men .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 16]: He has always had a pleasure in our society , and always been with us .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 19]: Abel has never been absent from us , for a day ; has he , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 64]: ` Never , my dear , ' returned the old gentleman , ` except when he went to Margate one Saturday with Mr Tomkinley that had been a teacher at that school he went to , and came back upon the Monday ; but he was very ill after that , you remember , my dear ; it was quite a dissipation . '
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 30]: ` He was not used to it , you know , ' said the old lady , ` and he could n't bear it , that 's the truth .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 23]: Besides he had no comfort in being there without us , and had nobody to talk to or enjoy himself with . '
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 22]: ` That was it , you know , ' interposed the same small quiet voice that had spoken once before . '
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 41]: I was quite abroad , mother , quite desolate , and to think that the sea was between us -- oh , I never shall forget what I felt when I first thought that the sea was between us ! '
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 12]: ` Very natural under the circumstances , ' observed the Notary .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 29]: ` Mr Abel 's feelings did credit to his nature , and credit to your nature , ma'am , and his father 's nature , and human nature .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 16]: I trace the same current now , flowing through all his quiet and unobtrusive proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 76]: -- -- I am about to sign my name , you observe , at the foot of the articles which Mr Chuckster will witness ; and placing my finger upon this blue wafer with the vandyked corners , I am constrained to remark in a distinct tone of voice -- do n't be alarmed , ma'am , it is merely a form of law -- that I deliver this , as my act and deed .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 23]: Mr Abel will place his name against the other wafer , repeating the same cabalistic words , and the business is over .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 4]: Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 10]: You see how easily these things are done ! '
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 49]: There was a short silence , apparently , while Mr Abel went through the prescribed form , and then the shaking of hands and shuffling of feet were renewed , and shortly afterwards there was a clinking of wine-glasses and a great talkativeness on the part of everybody .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 52]: In about a quarter of an hour Mr Chuckster -LRB- with a pen behind his ear and his face inflamed with wine -RRB- appeared at the door , and condescending to address Kit by the jocose appellation of ` Young Snob , ' informed him that the visitors were coming out .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 41]: Out they came forthwith ; Mr Witherden , who was short , chubby , fresh-coloured , brisk , and pompous , leading the old lady with extreme politeness , and the father and son following them , arm in arm .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 54]: Mr Abel , who had a quaint old-fashioned air about him , looked nearly of the same age as his father , and bore a wonderful resemblance to him in face and figure , though wanting something of his full , round , cheerfulness , and substituting in its place a timid reserve .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 27]: In all other respects , in the neatness of the dress , and even in the club-foot , he and the old gentleman were precisely alike .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 67]: Having seen the old lady safely in her seat , and assisted in the arrangement of her cloak and a small basket which formed an indispensable portion of her equipage , Mr Abel got into a little box behind which had evidently been made for his express accommodation , and smiled at everybody present by turns , beginning with his mother and ending with the pony .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 53]: There was then a great to-do to make the pony hold up his head that the bearing-rein might be fastened ; at last even this was effected ; and the old gentleman , taking his seat and the reins , put his hand in his pocket to find a sixpence for Kit .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 23]: He had no sixpence , neither had the old lady , nor Mr Abel , nor the Notary , nor Mr Chuckster .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 30]: The old gentleman thought a shilling too much , but there was no shop in the street to get change at , so he gave it to the boy .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 36]: ` There , ' he said jokingly , ` I 'm coming here again next Monday at the same time , and mind you 're here , my lad , to work it out . '
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 10]: ` Thank you , Sir , ' said Kit .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 10]: ` I 'll be sure to be here . '
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 30]: He was quite serious , but they all laughed heartily at his saying so , especially Mr Chuckster , who roared outright and appeared to relish the joke amazingly .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 49]: As the pony , with a presentiment that he was going home , or a determination that he would not go anywhere else -LRB- which was the same thing -RRB- trotted away pretty nimbly , Kit had no time to justify himself , and went his way also .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 62]: Having expended his treasure in such purchases as he knew would be most acceptable at home , not forgetting some seed for the wonderful bird , he hastened back as fast as he could , so elated with his success and great good fortune , that he more than half expected Nell and the old man would have arrived before him .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 54]: Chapter 15 Often , while they were yet pacing the silent streets of the town on the morning of their departure , the child trembled with a mingled sensation of hope and fear as in some far-off figure imperfectly seen in the clear distance , her fancy traced a likeness to honest Kit .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 105]: But although she would gladly have given him her hand and thanked him for what he had said at their last meeting , it was always a relief to find , when they came nearer to each other , that the person who approached was not he , but a stranger ; for even if she had not dreaded the effect which the sight of him might have wrought upon her fellow-traveller , she felt that to bid farewell to anybody now , and most of all to him who had been so faithful and so true , was more than she could bear .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 21]: It was enough to leave dumb things behind , and objects that were insensible both to her love and sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 23]: To have parted from her only other friend upon the threshold of that wild journey , would have wrung her heart indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 33]: Why is it that we can better bear to part in spirit than in body , and while we have the fortitude to act farewell have not the nerve to say it ?
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 69]: On the eve of long voyages or an absence of many years , friends who are tenderly attached will separate with the usual look , the usual pressure of the hand , planning one final interview for the morrow , while each well knows that it is but a poor feint to save the pain of uttering that one word , and that the meeting will never be .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 9]: Should possibilities be worse to bear than certainties ?
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 38]: We do not shun our dying friends ; the not having distinctly taken leave of one among them , whom we left in all kindness and affection , will often embitter the whole remainder of a life .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 58]: The town was glad with morning light ; places that had shown ugly and distrustful all night long , now wore a smile ; and sparkling sunbeams dancing on chamber windows , and twinkling through blind and curtain before sleepers ' eyes , shed light even into dreams , and chased away the shadows of the night .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 76]: Birds in hot rooms , covered up close and dark , felt it was morning , and chafed and grew restless in their little cells ; bright-eyed mice crept back to their tiny homes and nestled timidly together ; the sleek house-cat , forgetful of her prey , sat winking at the rays of sun starting through keyhole and cranny in the door , and longed for her stealthy run and warm sleek bask outside .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 51]: The nobler beasts confined in dens , stood motionless behind their bars and gazed on fluttering boughs , and sunshine peeping through some little window , with eyes in which old forests gleamed -- then trod impatiently the track their prisoned feet had worn -- and stopped and gazed again .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 20]: Men in their dungeons stretched their cramp cold limbs and cursed the stone that no bright sky could warm .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 18]: The flowers that sleep by night , opened their gentle eyes and turned them to the day .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 17]: The light , creation 's mind , was everywhere , and all things owned its power .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 25]: The two pilgrims , often pressing each other 's hands , or exchanging a smile or cheerful look , pursued their way in silence .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 47]: Bright and happy as it was , there was something solemn in the long , deserted streets , from which , like bodies without souls , all habitual character and expression had departed , leaving but one dead uniform repose , that made them all alike .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 50]: All was so still at that early hour , that the few pale people whom they met seemed as much unsuited to the scene , as the sickly lamp which had been here and there left burning , was powerless and faint in the full glory of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 38]: Before they had penetrated very far into the labyrinth of men 's abodes which yet lay between them and the outskirts , this aspect began to melt away , and noise and bustle to usurp its place .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 27]: Some straggling carts and coaches rumbling by , first broke the charm , then others came , then others yet more active , then a crowd .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 117]: The wonder was , at first , to see a tradesman 's window open , but it was a rare thing soon to see one closed ; then , smoke rose slowly from the chimneys , and sashes were thrown up to let in air , and doors were opened , and servant girls , looking lazily in all directions but their brooms , scattered brown clouds of dust into the eyes of shrinking passengers , or listened disconsolately to milkmen who spoke of country fairs , and told of waggons in the mews , with awnings and all things complete , and gallant swains to boot , which another hour would see upon their journey .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 27]: This quarter passed , they came upon the haunts of commerce and great traffic , where many people were resorting , and business was already rife .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 23]: The old man looked about him with a startled and bewildered gaze , for these were places that he hoped to shun .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 70]: He pressed his finger on his lip , and drew the child along by narrow courts and winding ways , nor did he seem at ease until they had left it far behind , often casting a backward look towards it , murmuring that ruin and self-murder were crouching in every street , and would follow if they scented them ; and that they could not fly too fast .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 38]: Again this quarter passed , they came upon a straggling neighbourhood , where the mean houses parcelled off in rooms , and windows patched with rags and paper , told of the populous poverty that sheltered there .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 20]: The shops sold goods that only poverty could buy , and sellers and buyers were pinched and griped alike .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 56]: Here were poor streets where faded gentility essayed with scanty space and shipwrecked means to make its last feeble stand , but tax-gatherer and creditor came there as elsewhere , and the poverty that yet faintly struggled was hardly less squalid and manifest than that which had long ago submitted and given up the game .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 36]: This was a wide , wide track -- for the humble followers of the camp of wealth pitch their tents round about it for many a mile -- but its character was still the same .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 207]: Damp rotten houses , many to let , many yet building , many half-built and mouldering away -- lodgings , where it would be hard to tell which needed pity most , those who let or those who came to take -- children , scantily fed and clothed , spread over every street , and sprawling in the dust -- scolding mothers , stamping their slipshod feet with noisy threats upon the pavement -- shabby fathers , hurrying with dispirited looks to the occupation which brought them ` daily bread ' and little more -- mangling-women , washer-women , cobblers , tailors , chandlers , driving their trades in parlours and kitchens and back room and garrets , and sometimes all of them under the same roof -- brick-fields skirting gardens paled with staves of old casks , or timber pillaged from houses burnt down , and blackened and blistered by the flames -- mounds of dock-weed , nettles , coarse grass and oyster-shells , heaped in rank confusion -- small dissenting chapels to teach , with no lack of illustration , the miseries of Earth , and plenty of new churches , erected with a little superfluous wealth , to show the way to Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 66]: At length these streets becoming more straggling yet , dwindled and dwindled away , until there were only small garden patches bordering the road , with many a summer house innocent of paint and built of old timber or some fragments of a boat , green as the tough cabbage-stalks that grew about it , and grottoed at the seams with toad-stools and tight-sticking snails .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 40]: To these succeeded pert cottages , two and two with plots of ground in front , laid out in angular beds with stiff box borders and narrow paths between , where footstep never strayed to make the gravel rough .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 64]: Then came the public-house , freshly painted in green and white , with tea-gardens and a bowling green , spurning its old neighbour with the horse-trough where the waggons stopped ; then , fields ; and then , some houses , one by one , of goodly size with lawns , some even with a lodge where dwelt a porter and his wife .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 115]: Then came a turnpike ; then fields again with trees and hay-stacks ; then , a hill , and on the top of that , the traveller might stop , and -- looking back at old Saint Paul 's looming through the smoke , its cross peeping above the cloud -LRB- if the day were clear -RRB- , and glittering in the sun ; and casting his eyes upon the Babel out of which it grew until he traced it down to the furthest outposts of the invading army of bricks and mortar whose station lay for the present nearly at his feet -- might feel at last that he was clear of London .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 39]: Near such a spot as this , and in a pleasant field , the old man and his little guide -LRB- if guide she were , who knew not whither they were bound -RRB- sat down to rest .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 25]: She had had the precaution to furnish her basket with some slices of bread and meat , and here they made their frugal breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 86]: The freshness of the day , the singing of the birds , the beauty of the waving grass , the deep green leaves , the wild flowers , and the thousand exquisite scents and sounds that floated in the air -- deep joys to most of us , but most of all to those whose life is in a crowd or who live solitarily in great cities as in the bucket of a human well -- sunk into their breasts and made them very glad .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 38]: The child had repeated her artless prayers once that morning , more earnestly perhaps than she had ever done in all her life , but as she felt all this , they rose to her lips again .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 28]: The old man took off his hat -- he had no memory for the words -- but he said amen , and that they were very good .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 52]: There had been an old copy of the Pilgrim 's Progress , with strange plates , upon a shelf at home , over which she had often pored whole evenings , wondering whether it was true in every word , and where those distant countries with the curious names might be .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 21]: As she looked back upon the place they had left , one part of it came strongly on her mind .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 67]: ` Dear grandfather , ' she said , ` only that this place is prettier and a great deal better than the real one , if that in the book is like it , I feel as if we were both Christian , and laid down on this grass all the cares and troubles we brought with us ; never to take them up again . '
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 24]: ` No -- never to return -- never to return ' -- replied the old man , waving his hand towards the city .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 12]: ` Thou and I are free of it now , Nell .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 8]: They shall never lure us back . '
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 6]: ` Are you tired ? '
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 20]: said the child , ` are you sure you do n't feel ill from this long walk ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 19]: I shall never feel ill again , now that we are once away , ' was his reply .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 8]: ` Let us be stirring , Nell .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 13]: We must be further away -- a long , long way further .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 12]: We are too near to stop , and be at rest .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 3]: Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 32]: There was a pool of clear water in the field , in which the child laved her hands and face , and cooled her feet before setting forth to walk again .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 40]: She would have the old man refresh himself in this way too , and making him sit down upon the grass , cast the water on him with her hands , and dried it with her simple dress . '
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 34]: I can do nothing for myself , my darling , ' said the grandfather ; ' I do n't know how it is , I could once , but the time 's gone .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 16]: Do n't leave me , Nell ; say that thou ` lt not leave me .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 11]: I loved thee all the while , indeed I did .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 14]: If I lose thee too , my dear , I must die ! '
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 11]: He laid his head upon her shoulder and moaned piteously .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 28]: The time had been , and a very few days before , when the child could not have restrained her tears and must have wept with him .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 28]: But now she soothed him with gentle and tender words , smiled at his thinking they could ever part , and rallied him cheerfully upon the jest .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 21]: He was soon calmed and fell asleep , singing to himself in a low voice , like a little child .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 10]: He awoke refreshed , and they continued their journey .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 33]: The road was pleasant , lying between beautiful pastures and fields of corn , about which , poised high in the clear blue sky , the lark trilled out her happy song .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 33]: The air came laden with the fragrance it caught upon its way , and the bees , upborne upon its scented breath , hummed forth their drowsy satisfaction as they floated by .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 23]: They were now in the open country ; the houses were very few and scattered at long intervals , often miles apart .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 45]: Occasionally they came upon a cluster of poor cottages , some with a chair or low board put across the open door to keep the scrambling children from the road , others shut up close while all the family were working in the fields .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 64]: These were often the commencement of a little village : and after an interval came a wheelwright 's shed or perhaps a blacksmith 's forge ; then a thriving farm with sleepy cows lying about the yard , and horses peering over the low wall and scampering away when harnessed horses passed upon the road , as though in triumph at their freedom .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 74]: There were dull pigs too , turning up the ground in search of dainty food , and grunting their monotonous grumblings as they prowled about , or crossed each other in their quest ; plump pigeons skimming round the roof or strutting on the eaves ; and ducks and geese , far more graceful in their own conceit , waddling awkwardly about the edges of the pond or sailing glibly on its surface .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 81]: The farm-yard passed , then came the little inn ; the humbler beer-shop ; and the village tradesman 's ; then the lawyer 's and the parson 's , at whose dread names the beer-shop trembled ; the church then peeped out modestly from a clump of trees ; then there were a few more cottages ; then the cage , and pound , and not unfrequently , on a bank by the way-side , a deep old dusty well .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 15]: Then came the trim-hedged fields on either hand , and the open road again .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 20]: They walked all day , and slept that night at a small cottage where beds were let to travellers .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 25]: Next morning they were afoot again , and though jaded at first , and very tired , recovered before long and proceeded briskly forward .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 30]: They often stopped to rest , but only for a short space at a time , and still kept on , having had but slight refreshment since the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 44]: It was nearly five o'clock in the afternoon , when drawing near another cluster of labourers ' huts , the child looked wistfully in each , doubtful at which to ask for permission to rest awhile , and buy a draught of milk .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 17]: It was not easy to determine , for she was timid and fearful of being repulsed .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 12]: Here was a crying child , and there a noisy wife .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 15]: In this , the people seemed too poor ; in that , too many .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 44]: At length she stopped at one where the family were seated round the table -- chiefly because there was an old man sitting in a cushioned chair beside the hearth , and she thought he was a grandfather and would feel for hers .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 20]: There were besides , the cottager and his wife , and three young sturdy children , brown as berries .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 10]: The request was no sooner preferred , than granted .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 40]: The eldest boy ran out to fetch some milk , the second dragged two stools towards the door , and the youngest crept to his mother 's gown , and looked at the strangers from beneath his sunburnt hand .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 25]: ` God save you , master , ' said the old cottager in a thin piping voice ; ` are you travelling far ? '
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 21]: ` Yes , Sir , a long way ' -- replied the child ; for her grandfather appealed to her .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 5]: ` From London ? '
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 5]: inquired the old man .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 5]: The child said yes .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 19]: He had been in London many a time -- used to go there often once , with waggons .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 22]: It was nigh two-and-thirty year since he had been there last , and he did hear say there were great changes .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 3]: Like enough !
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 9]: He had changed , himself , since then .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 44]: Two-and-thirty year was a long time and eighty-four a great age , though there was some he had known that had lived to very hard upon a hundred -- and not so hearty as he , neither -- no , nothing like it .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 33]: ` Sit thee down , master , in the elbow chair , ' said the old man , knocking his stick upon the brick floor , and trying to do so sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 40]: ` Take a pinch out o ' that box ; I do n't take much myself , for it comes dear , but I find it wakes me up sometimes , and ye 're but a boy to me .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 41]: I should have a son pretty nigh as old as you if he 'd lived , but they listed him for a so ` ger -- he come back home though , for all he had but one poor leg .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 53]: He always said he 'd be buried near the sun-dial he used to climb upon when he was a baby , did my poor boy , and his words come true -- you can see the place with your own eyes ; we 've kept the turf up , ever since . '
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 32]: He shook his head , and looking at his daughter with watery eyes , said she need n't be afraid that he was going to talk about that , any more .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 27]: He did n't wish to trouble nobody , and if he had troubled anybody by what he said , he asked pardon , that was all .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 27]: The milk arrived , and the child producing her little basket , and selecting its best fragments for her grandfather , they made a hearty meal .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 87]: The furniture of the room was very homely of course -- a few rough chairs and a table , a corner cupboard with their little stock of crockery and delf , a gaudy tea-tray , representing a lady in bright red , walking out with a very blue parasol , a few common , coloured scripture subjects in frames upon the wall and chimney , an old dwarf clothes-press and an eight-day clock , with a few bright saucepans and a kettle , comprised the whole .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 31]: But everything was clean and neat , and as the child glanced round , she felt a tranquil air of comfort and content to which she had long been unaccustomed .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 12]: ` How far is it to any town or village ? '
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 7]: she asked of the husband . '
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 25]: A matter of good five mile , my dear , ' was the reply , ` but you 're not going on to-night ? '
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 20]: ` Yes , yes , Nell , ' said the old man hastily , urging her too by signs .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 18]: ` Further on , further on , darling , further away if we walk till midnight . '
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 34]: ` There 's a good barn hard by , master , ' said the man , ` or there 's travellers ' lodging , I know , at the Plow an ' Harrer .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 37]: Excuse me , but you do seem a little tired , and unless you 're very anxious to get on -- ' ` Yes , yes , we are , ' returned the old man fretfully .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 12]: ` Further away , dear Nell , pray further away . '
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 19]: ` We must go on , indeed , ' said the child , yielding to his restless wish .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 15]: ` We thank you very much , but we can not stop so soon .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 8]: I 'm quite ready , grandfather . '
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 97]: But the woman had observed , from the young wanderer 's gait , that one of her little feet was blistered and sore , and being a woman and a mother too , she would not suffer her to go until she had washed the place and applied some simple remedy , which she did so carefully and with such a gentle hand -- rough-grained and hard though it was , with work -- that the child 's heart was too full to admit of her saying more than a fervent ` God bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 21]: nor could she look back nor trust herself to speak , until they had left the cottage some distance behind .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 57]: When she turned her head , she saw that the whole family , even the old grandfather , were standing in the road watching them as they went , and so , with many waves of the hand , and cheering nods , and on one side at least not without tears , they parted company .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 41]: They trudged forward , more slowly and painfully than they had done yet , for another mile or thereabouts , when they heard the sound of wheels behind them , and looking round observed an empty cart approaching pretty briskly .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 16]: The driver on coming up to them stopped his horse and looked earnestly at Nell .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 13]: ` Did n't you stop to rest at a cottage yonder ? '
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 10]: ` Yes , sir , ' replied the child .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 14]: They asked me to look out for you , ' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 7]: ` I 'm going your way .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 11]: Give me your hand -- jump up , master . '
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 18]: This was a great relief , for they were very much fatigued and could scarcely crawl along .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 20]: To them the jolting cart was a luxurious carriage , and the ride the most delicious in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 27]: Nell had scarcely settled herself on a little heap of straw in one corner , when she fell asleep , for the first time that day .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 19]: She was awakened by the stopping of the cart , which was about to turn up a bye-lane .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 47]: The driver kindly got down to help her out , and pointing to some trees at a very short distance before them , said that the town lay there , and that they had better take the path which they would see leading through the churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 12]: Accordingly , towards this spot , they directed their weary steps .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 57]: Chapter 16 The sun was setting when they reached the wicket-gate at which the path began , and , as the rain falls upon the just and unjust alike , it shed its warm tint even upon the resting-places of the dead , and bade them be of good hope for its rising on the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 19]: The church was old and grey , with ivy clinging to the walls , and round the porch .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 78]: Shunning the tombs , it crept about the mounds , beneath which slept poor humble men : twining for them the first wreaths they had ever won , but wreaths less liable to wither and far more lasting in their kind , than some which were graven deep in stone and marble , and told in pompous terms of virtues meekly hidden for many a year , and only revealed at last to executors and mourning legatees .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 83]: The clergyman 's horse , stumbling with a dull blunt sound among the graves , was cropping the grass ; at once deriving orthodox consolation from the dead parishioners , and enforcing last Sunday 's text that this was what all flesh came to ; a lean ass who had sought to expound it also , without being qualified and ordained , was pricking his ears in an empty pound hard by , and looking with hungry eyes upon his priestly neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 31]: The old man and the child quitted the gravel path , and strayed among the tombs ; for there the ground was soft , and easy to their tired feet .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 23]: As they passed behind the church , they heard voices near at hand , and presently came on those who had spoken .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 27]: They were two men who were seated in easy attitudes upon the grass , and so busily engaged as to be at first unconscious of intruders .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 55]: It was not difficult to divine that they were of a class of itinerant showmen -- exhibitors of the freaks of Punch -- for , perched cross-legged upon a tombstone behind them , was a figure of that hero himself , his nose and chin as hooked and his face as beaming as usual .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 59]: Perhaps his imperturbable character was never more strikingly developed , for he preserved his usual equable smile notwithstanding that his body was dangling in a most uncomfortable position , all loose and limp and shapeless , while his long peaked cap , unequally balanced against his exceedingly slight legs , threatened every instant to bring him toppling down .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 33]: In part scattered upon the ground at the feet of the two men , and in part jumbled together in a long flat box , were the other persons of the Drama .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 76]: The hero 's wife and one child , the hobby-horse , the doctor , the foreign gentleman who not being familiar with the language is unable in the representation to express his ideas otherwise than by the utterance of the word ` Shallabalah ' three distinct times , the radical neighbour who will by no means admit that a tin bell is an organ , the executioner , and the devil , were all here .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 70]: Their owners had evidently come to that spot to make some needful repairs in the stage arrangements , for one of them was engaged in binding together a small gallows with thread , while the other was intent upon fixing a new black wig , with the aid of a small hammer and some tacks , upon the head of the radical neighbour , who had been beaten bald .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 29]: They raised their eyes when the old man and his young companion were close upon them , and pausing in their work , returned their looks of curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 37]: One of them , the actual exhibitor no doubt , was a little merry-faced man with a twinkling eye and a red nose , who seemed to have unconsciously imbibed something of his hero 's character .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 28]: The other -- that was he who took the money -- had rather a careful and cautious look , which was perhaps inseparable from his occupation also .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 41]: The merry man was the first to greet the strangers with a nod ; and following the old man 's eyes , he observed that perhaps that was the first time he had ever seen a Punch off the stage .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 36]: -LRB- Punch , it may be remarked , seemed to be pointing with the tip of his cap to a most flourishing epitaph , and to be chuckling over it with all his heart . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 11]: ` Why do you come here to do this ? '
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 19]: said the old man , sitting down beside them , and looking at the figures with extreme delight .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 39]: ` Why you see , ' rejoined the little man , ` we 're putting up for to-night at the public-house yonder , and it would n't do to let 'em see the present company undergoing repair . '
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 18]: cried the old man , making signs to Nell to listen , ` why not , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 4]: why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 21]: ` Because it would destroy all the delusion , and take away all the interest , would n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 5]: replied the little man .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 24]: ` Would you care a ha ` penny for the Lord Chancellor if you know 'd him in private and without his wig ?
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 6]: -- - certainly not . '
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 4]: ` Good ! '
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 23]: said the old man , venturing to touch one of the puppets , and drawing away his hand with a shrill laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 9]: ` Are you going to show 'em to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 4]: are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 39]: ` That is the intention , governor , ' replied the other , ` and unless I 'm much mistaken , Tommy Codlin is a calculating at this minute what we 've lost through your coming upon us .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 12]: Cheer up , Tommy , it ca n't be much . '
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 24]: The little man accompanied these latter words with a wink , expressive of the estimate he had formed of the travellers ' finances .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 48]: To this Mr Codlin , who had a surly , grumbling manner , replied , as he twitched Punch off the tombstone and flung him into the box , ' I do n't care if we have n't lost a farden , but you 're too free .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 27]: If you stood in front of the curtain and see the public 's faces as I do , you 'd know human natur ' better . '
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 21]: it 's been the spoiling of you , Tommy , your taking to that branch , ' rejoined his companion .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 24]: ` When you played the ghost in the reg ` lar drama in the fairs , you believed in everything -- except ghosts .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 8]: But now you 're a universal mistruster .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 9]: I never see a man so changed . '
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 18]: ` Never mind , ' said Mr Codlin , with the air of a discontented philosopher . '
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 16]: I know better now , and p ` raps I 'm sorry for it . '
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 47]: Turning over the figures in the box like one who knew and despised them , Mr Codlin drew one forth and held it up for the inspection of his friend : ` Look here ; here 's all this judy 's clothes falling to pieces again .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 12]: You have n't got a needle and thread I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 22]: The little man shook his head , and scratched it ruefully as he contemplated this severe indisposition of a principal performer .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 29]: Seeing that they were at a loss , the child said timidly : ' I have a needle , Sir , in my basket , and thread too .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 11]: Will you let me try to mend it for you ?
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 12]: I think I could do it neater than you could . '
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 13]: Even Mr Codlin had nothing to urge against a proposal so seasonable .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 23]: Nelly , kneeling down beside the box , was soon busily engaged in her task , and accomplishing it to a miracle .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 31]: While she was thus engaged , the merry little man looked at her with an interest which did not appear to be diminished when he glanced at her helpless companion .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 17]: When she had finished her work he thanked her , and inquired whither they were travelling .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 20]: ` N -- no further to-night , I think , ' said the child , looking towards her grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 31]: ` If you 're wanting a place to stop at , ' the man remarked , ' I should advise you to take up at the same house with us .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 4]: That 's it .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 9]: The long , low , white house there .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 6]: It 's very cheap . '
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 25]: The old man , notwithstanding his fatigue , would have remained in the churchyard all night if his new acquaintances had remained there too .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 109]: As he yielded to this suggestion a ready and rapturous assent , they all rose and walked away together ; he keeping close to the box of puppets in which he was quite absorbed , the merry little man carrying it slung over his arm by a strap attached to it for the purpose , Nelly having hold of her grandfather 's hand , and Mr Codlin sauntering slowly behind , casting up at the church tower and neighbouring trees such looks as he was accustomed in town-practice to direct to drawing-room and nursery windows , when seeking for a profitable spot on which to plant the show .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 35]: The public-house was kept by a fat old landlord and landlady who made no objection to receiving their new guests , but praised Nelly 's beauty and were at once prepossessed in her behalf .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 28]: There was no other company in the kitchen but the two showmen , and the child felt very thankful that they had fallen upon such good quarters .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 30]: The landlady was very much astonished to learn that they had come all the way from London , and appeared to have no little curiosity touching their farther destination .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 32]: The child parried her inquiries as well as she could , and with no great trouble , for finding that they appeared to give her pain , the old lady desisted .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 35]: ` These two gentlemen have ordered supper in an hour 's time , ' she said , taking her into the bar ; ` and your best plan will be to sup with them .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 31]: Meanwhile you shall have a little taste of something that 'll do you good , for I 'm sure you must want it after all you 've gone through to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 24]: Now , do n't look after the old gentleman , because when you 've drank that , he shall have some too . '
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 38]: As nothing could induce the child to leave him alone , however , or to touch anything in which he was not the first and greatest sharer , the old lady was obliged to help him first .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 52]: When they had been thus refreshed , the whole house hurried away into an empty stable where the show stood , and where , by the light of a few flaring candles stuck round a hoop which hung by a line from the ceiling , it was to be forthwith exhibited .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 126]: And now Mr Thomas Codlin , the misanthrope , after blowing away at the Pan 's pipes until he was intensely wretched , took his station on one side of the checked drapery which concealed the mover of the figures , and putting his hands in his pockets prepared to reply to all questions and remarks of Punch , and to make a dismal feint of being his most intimate private friend , of believing in him to the fullest and most unlimited extent , of knowing that he enjoyed day and night a merry and glorious existence in that temple , and that he was at all times and under every circumstance the same intelligent and joyful person that the spectators then beheld him .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 67]: All this Mr Codlin did with the air of a man who had made up his mind for the worst and was quite resigned ; his eye slowly wandering about during the briskest repartee to observe the effect upon the audience , and particularly the impression made upon the landlord and landlady , which might be productive of very important results in connexion with the supper .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 43]: Upon this head , however , he had no cause for any anxiety , for the whole performance was applauded to the echo , and voluntary contributions were showered in with a liberality which testified yet more strongly to the general delight .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 15]: Among the laughter none was more loud and frequent than the old man 's .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 45]: Nell 's was unheard , for she , poor child , with her head drooping on his shoulder , had fallen asleep , and slept too soundly to be roused by any of his efforts to awaken her to a participation in his glee .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 31]: The supper was very good , but she was too tired to eat , and yet would not leave the old man until she had kissed him in his bed .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 47]: He , happily insensible to every care and anxiety , sat listening with a vacant smile and admiring face to all that his new friend said ; and it was not until they retired yawning to their room , that he followed the child up stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 32]: It was but a loft partitioned into two compartments , where they were to rest , but they were well pleased with their lodging and had hoped for none so good .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 31]: The old man was uneasy when he had lain down , and begged that Nell would come and sit at his bedside as she had done for so many nights .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 12]: She hastened to him , and sat there till he slept .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 35]: There was a little window , hardly more than a chink in the wall , in her room , and when she left him , she opened it , quite wondering at the silence .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 31]: The sight of the old church , and the graves about it in the moonlight , and the dark trees whispering among themselves , made her more thoughtful than before .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 22]: She closed the window again , and sitting down upon the bed , thought of the life that was before them .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 24]: She had a little money , but it was very little , and when that was gone , they must begin to beg .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 26]: There was one piece of gold among it , and an emergency might come when its worth to them would be increased a hundred fold .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 28]: It would be best to hide this coin , and never produce it unless their case was absolutely desperate , and no other resource was left them .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 28]: Her resolution taken , she sewed the piece of gold into her dress , and going to bed with a lighter heart sunk into a deep slumber .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 26]: Chapter 17 Another bright day shining in through the small casement , and claiming fellowship with the kindred eyes of the child , awoke her .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 44]: At sight of the strange room and its unaccustomed objects she started up in alarm , wondering how she had been moved from the familiar chamber in which she seemed to have fallen asleep last night , and whither she had been conveyed .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 26]: But , another glance around called to her mind all that had lately passed , and she sprung from her bed , hoping and trustful .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 54]: It was yet early , and the old man being still asleep , she walked out into the churchyard , brushing the dew from the long grass with her feet , and often turning aside into places where it grew longer than in others , that she might not tread upon the graves .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 49]: She felt a curious kind of pleasure in lingering among these houses of the dead , and read the inscriptions on the tombs of the good people -LRB- a great number of good people were buried there -RRB- , passing on from one to another with increasing interest .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 48]: It was a very quiet place , as such a place should be , save for the cawing of the rooks who had built their nests among the branches of some tall old trees , and were calling to one another , high up in the air .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 47]: First , one sleek bird , hovering near his ragged house as it swung and dangled in the wind , uttered his hoarse cry , quite by chance as it would seem , and in a sober tone as though he were but talking to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 37]: Another answered , and he called again , but louder than before ; then another spoke and then another ; and each time the first , aggravated by contradiction , insisted on his case more strongly .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 119]: Other voices , silent till now , struck in from boughs lower down and higher up and midway , and to the right and left , and from the tree-tops ; and others , arriving hastily from the grey church turrets and old belfry window , joined the clamour which rose and fell , and swelled and dropped again , and still went on ; and all this noisy contention amidst a skimming to and fro , and lighting on fresh branches , and frequent change of place , which satirised the old restlessness of those who lay so still beneath the moss and turf below , and the strife in which they had worn away their lives .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 100]: Frequently raising her eyes to the trees whence these sounds came down , and feeling as though they made the place more quiet than perfect silence would have done , the child loitered from grave to grave , now stopping to replace with careful hands the bramble which had started from some green mound it helped to keep in shape , and now peeping through one of the low latticed windows into the church , with its worm-eaten books upon the desks , and baize of whitened-green mouldering from the pew sides and leaving the naked wood to view .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 57]: There were the seats where the poor old people sat , worn spare , and yellow like themselves ; the rugged font where children had their names , the homely altar where they knelt in after life , the plain black tressels that bore their weight on their last visit to the cool old shady church .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 28]: Everything told of long use and quiet slow decay ; the very bell-rope in the porch was frayed into a fringe , and hoary with old age .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 67]: She was looking at a humble stone which told of a young man who had died at twenty-three years old , fifty-five years ago , when she heard a faltering step approaching , and looking round saw a feeble woman bent with the weight of years , who tottered to the foot of that same grave and asked her to read the writing on the stone .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 34]: The old woman thanked her when she had done , saying that she had had the words by heart for many a long , long year , but could not see them now .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 7]: ` Were you his mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 5]: said the child . '
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 9]: I was his wife , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 10]: She the wife of a young man of three-and-twenty !
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 4]: Ah , true !
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 6]: It was fifty-five years ago .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 19]: ` You wonder to hear me say that , ' remarked the old woman , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 7]: ` You 're not the first .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 13]: Older folk than you have wondered at the same thing before now .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 7]: Yes , I was his wife .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 13]: Death does n't change us more than life , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 8]: ` Do you come here often ? '
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 5]: asked the child . '
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 39]: I sit here very often in the summer time , ' she answered , ' I used to come here once to cry and mourn , but that was a weary while ago , bless God ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 24]: I pluck the daisies as they grow , and take them home , ' said the old woman after a short silence . '
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 16]: I like no flowers so well as these , and have n't for five-and-fifty years .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 14]: It 's a long time , and I 'm getting very old . '
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 71]: Then growing garrulous upon a theme which was new to one listener though it were but a child , she told her how she had wept and moaned and prayed to die herself , when this happened ; and how when she first came to that place , a young creature strong in love and grief , she had hoped that her heart was breaking as it seemed to be .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 50]: But that time passed by , and although she continued to be sad when she came there , still she could bear to come , and so went on until it was pain no longer , but a solemn pleasure , and a duty she had learned to like .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 133]: And now that five-and-fifty years were gone , she spoke of the dead man as if he had been her son or grandson , with a kind of pity for his youth , growing out of her own old age , and an exalting of his strength and manly beauty as compared with her own weakness and decay ; and yet she spoke about him as her husband too , and thinking of herself in connexion with him , as she used to be and not as she was now , talked of their meeting in another world , as if he were dead but yesterday , and she , separated from her former self , were thinking of the happiness of that comely girl who seemed to have died with him .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 19]: The child left her gathering the flowers that grew upon the grave , and thoughtfully retraced her steps .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 11]: The old man was by this time up and dressed .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 75]: Mr Codlin , still doomed to contemplate the harsh realities of existence , was packing among his linen the candle-ends which had been saved from the previous night 's performance ; while his companion received the compliments of all the loungers in the stable-yard , who , unable to separate him from the master-mind of Punch , set him down as next in importance to that merry outlaw , and loved him scarcely less .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 22]: When he had sufficiently acknowledged his popularity he came in to breakfast , at which meal they all sat down together .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 9]: ` And where are you going to-day ? '
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 10]: said the little man , addressing himself to Nell .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 17]: ` Indeed I hardly know -- we have not determined yet , ' replied the child .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 15]: ` We 're going on to the races , ' said the little man .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 20]: ` If that 's your way and you like to have us for company , let us travel together .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 22]: If you prefer going alone , only say the word and you 'll find that we sha n't trouble you . '
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 13]: ` We 'll go with you , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 10]: ` Nell -- with them , with them . '
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 52]: The child considered for a moment , and reflecting that she must shortly beg , and could scarcely hope to do so at a better place than where crowds of rich ladies and gentlemen were assembled together for purposes of enjoyment and festivity , determined to accompany these men so far .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 40]: She therefore thanked the little man for his offer , and said , glancing timidly towards his friend , that if there was no objection to their accompanying them as far as the race town -- ` Objection ! '
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 5]: said the little man .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 20]: ` Now be gracious for once , Tommy , and say that you 'd rather they went with us .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 5]: I know you would .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 6]: Be gracious , Tommy . '
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 33]: ` Trotters , ' said Mr Codlin , who talked very slowly and ate very greedily , as is not uncommon with philosophers and misanthropes ; ` you 're too free . '
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 9]: ` Why what harm can it do ? '
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 4]: urged the other .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 36]: ` No harm at all in this particular case , perhaps , ' replied Mr Codlin ; ` but the principle 's a dangerous one , and you 're too free I tell you . '
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 13]: ` Well , are they to go with us or not ? '
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 27]: ` Yes , they are , ' said Mr Codlin ; ` but you might have made a favour of it , might n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 47]: The real name of the little man was Harris , but it had gradually merged into the less euphonious one of Trotters , which , with the prefatory adjective , Short , had been conferred upon him by reason of the small size of his legs .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 61]: Short Trotters however , being a compound name , inconvenient of use in friendly dialogue , the gentleman on whom it had been bestowed was known among his intimates either as ` Short , ' or ` Trotters , ' and was seldom accosted at full length as Short Trotters , except in formal conversations and on occasions of ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 64]: Short , then , or Trotters , as the reader pleases , returned unto the remonstrance of his friend Mr Thomas Codlin a jocose answer calculated to turn aside his discontent ; and applying himself with great relish to the cold boiled beef , the tea , and bread and butter , strongly impressed upon his companions that they should do the like .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 55]: Mr Codlin indeed required no such persuasion , as he had already eaten as much as he could possibly carry and was now moistening his clay with strong ale , whereof he took deep draughts with a silent relish and invited nobody to partake -- thus again strongly indicating his misanthropical turn of mind .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 55]: Breakfast being at length over , Mr Codlin called the bill , and charging the ale to the company generally -LRB- a practice also savouring of misanthropy -RRB- divided the sum-total into two fair and equal parts , assigning one moiety to himself and friend , and the other to Nelly and her grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 25]: These being duly discharged and all things ready for their departure , they took farewell of the landlord and landlady and resumed their journey .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 96]: And here Mr Codlin 's false position in society and the effect it wrought upon his wounded spirit , were strongly illustrated ; for whereas he had been last night accosted by Mr Punch as ` master , ' and had by inference left the audience to understand that he maintained that individual for his own luxurious entertainment and delight , here he was , now , painfully walking beneath the burden of that same Punch 's temple , and bearing it bodily upon his shoulders on a sultry day and along a dusty road .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 65]: In place of enlivening his patron with a constant fire of wit or the cheerful rattle of his quarter-staff on the heads of his relations and acquaintance , here was that beaming Punch utterly devoid of spine , all slack and drooping in a dark box , with his legs doubled up round his neck , and not one of his social qualities remaining .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 24]: Mr Codlin trudged heavily on , exchanging a word or two at intervals with Short , and stopping to rest and growl occasionally .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 34]: Short led the way ; with the flat box , the private luggage -LRB- which was not extensive -RRB- tied up in a bundle , and a brazen trumpet slung from his shoulder-blade .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 19]: Nell and her grandfather walked next him on either hand , and Thomas Codlin brought up the rear .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 45]: When they came to any town or village , or even to a detached house of good appearance , Short blew a blast upon the brazen trumpet and carolled a fragment of a song in that hilarious tone common to Punches and their consorts .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 33]: If people hurried to the windows , Mr Codlin pitched the temple , and hastily unfurling the drapery and concealing Short therewith , flourished hysterically on the pipes and performed an air .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 54]: Then the entertainment began as soon as might be ; Mr Codlin having the responsibility of deciding on its length and of protracting or expediting the time for the hero 's final triumph over the enemy of mankind , according as he judged that the after-crop of half-pence would be plentiful or scant .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 21]: When it had been gathered in to the last farthing , he resumed his load and on they went again .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 42]: Sometimes they played out the toll across a bridge or ferry , and once exhibited by particular desire at a turnpike , where the collector , being drunk in his solitude , paid down a shilling to have it to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 76]: There was one small place of rich promise in which their hopes were blighted , for a favourite character in the play having gold-lace upon his coat and being a meddling wooden-headed fellow was held to be a libel on the beadle , for which reason the authorities enforced a quick retreat ; but they were generally well received , and seldom left a town without a troop of ragged children shouting at their heels .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 27]: They made a long day 's journey , despite these interruptions , and were yet upon the road when the moon was shining in the sky .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 18]: Short beguiled the time with songs and jests , and made the best of everything that happened .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 41]: Mr Codlin on the other hand , cursed his fate , and all the hollow things of earth -LRB- but Punch especially -RRB- , and limped along with the theatre on his back , a prey to the bitterest chagrin .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 70]: They had stopped to rest beneath a finger-post where four roads met , and Mr Codlin in his deep misanthropy had let down the drapery and seated himself in the bottom of the show , invisible to mortal eyes and disdainful of the company of his fellow creatures , when two monstrous shadows were seen stalking towards them from a turning in the road by which they had come .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 58]: The child was at first quite terrified by the sight of these gaunt giants -- for such they looked as they advanced with lofty strides beneath the shadow of the trees -- but Short , telling her there was nothing to fear , blew a blast upon the trumpet , which was answered by a cheerful shout .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 12]: ` It 's Grinder 's lot , a n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 8]: cried Mr Short in a loud key .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 11]: ` Yes , ' replied a couple of shrill voices .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 9]: ` Come on then , ' said Short .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 9]: ` Let 's have a look at you .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 7]: I thought it was you . '
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 21]: Thus invited , ` Grinder 's lot ' approached with redoubled speed and soon came up with the little party .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 43]: Mr Grinder 's company , familiarly termed a lot , consisted of a young gentleman and a young lady on stilts , and Mr Grinder himself , who used his natural legs for pedestrian purposes and carried at his back a drum .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 63]: The public costume of the young people was of the Highland kind , but the night being damp and cold , the young gentleman wore over his kilt a man 's pea jacket reaching to his ankles , and a glazed hat ; the young lady too was muffled in an old cloth pelisse and had a handkerchief tied about her head .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 19]: Their Scotch bonnets , ornamented with plumes of jet black feathers , Mr Grinder carried on his instrument .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 19]: ` Bound for the races , I see , ' said Mr Grinder coming up out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 5]: ` So are we .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 7]: How are you , Short ? '
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 11]: With that they shook hands in a very friendly manner .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 19]: The young people being too high up for the ordinary salutations , saluted Short after their own fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 23]: The young gentleman twisted up his right stilt and patted him on the shoulder , and the young lady rattled her tambourine .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 4]: ` Practice ? '
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 8]: said Short , pointing to the stilts .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 7]: ` No , ' returned Grinder .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 24]: ` It comes either to walkin ' in 'em or carryin ' of 'em , and they like walkin ' in 'em best .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 8]: It 's wery pleasant for the prospects .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 7]: Which road are you takin ' ?
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 6]: We go the nighest . '
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 36]: ` Why , the fact is , ' said Short , ` that we are going the longest way , because then we could stop for the night , a mile and a half on .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 31]: But three or four mile gained to-night is so many saved to-morrow , and if you keep on , I think our best way is to do the same . '
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 7]: ` Where 's your partner ? '
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 3]: inquired Grinder .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 50]: ` Here he is , ' cried Mr Thomas Codlin , presenting his head and face in the proscenium of the stage , and exhibiting an expression of countenance not often seen there ; ` and he 'll see his partner boiled alive before he 'll go on to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 7]: That 's what he says . '
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 25]: ` Well , do n't say such things as them , in a spear which is dewoted to something pleasanter , ' urged Short .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 15]: ` Respect associations , Tommy , even if you do cut up rough . '
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 63]: ` Rough or smooth , ' said Mr Codlin , beating his hand on the little footboard where Punch , when suddenly struck with the symmetry of his legs and their capacity for silk stockings , is accustomed to exhibit them to popular admiration , ` rough or smooth , I wo n't go further than the mile and a half to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 11]: I put up at the Jolly Sandboys and nowhere else .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 10]: If you like to come there , come there .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 23]: If you like to go on by yourself , go on by yourself , and do without me if you can . '
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 34]: So saying , Mr Codlin disappeared from the scene and immediately presented himself outside the theatre , took it on his shoulders at a jerk , and made off with most remarkable agility .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 28]: Any further controversy being now out of the question , Short was fain to part with Mr Grinder and his pupils and to follow his morose companion .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 52]: After lingering at the finger-post for a few minutes to see the stilts frisking away in the moonlight and the bearer of the drum toiling slowly after them , he blew a few notes upon the trumpet as a parting salute , and hastened with all speed to follow Mr Codlin .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 77]: With this view he gave his unoccupied hand to Nell , and bidding her be of good cheer as they would soon be at the end of their journey for that night , and stimulating the old man with a similar assurance , led them at a pretty swift pace towards their destination , which he was the less unwilling to make for , as the moon was now overcast and the clouds were threatening rain .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 50]: Chapter 18 The Jolly Sandboys was a small road-side inn of pretty ancient date , with a sign , representing three Sandboys increasing their jollity with as many jugs of ale and bags of gold , creaking and swinging on its post on the opposite side of the road .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 105]: As the travellers had observed that day many indications of their drawing nearer and nearer to the race town , such as gipsy camps , carts laden with gambling booths and their appurtenances , itinerant showmen of various kinds , and beggars and trampers of every degree , all wending their way in the same direction , Mr Codlin was fearful of finding the accommodations forestalled ; this fear increasing as he diminished the distance between himself and the hostelry , he quickened his pace , and notwithstanding the burden he had to carry , maintained a round trot until he reached the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 59]: Here he had the gratification of finding that his fears were without foundation , for the landlord was leaning against the door-post looking lazily at the rain , which had by this time begun to descend heavily , and no tinkling of cracked bell , nor boisterous shout , nor noisy chorus , gave note of company within .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 5]: ` All alone ? '
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 13]: said Mr Codlin , putting down his burden and wiping his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 27]: ` All alone as yet , ' rejoined the landlord , glancing at the sky , ` but we shall have more company to-night I expect .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 13]: Here one of you boys , carry that show into the barn .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 41]: Make haste in out of the wet , Tom ; when it came on to rain I told 'em to make the fire up , and there 's a glorious blaze in the kitchen , I can tell you . '
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 23]: Mr Codlin followed with a willing mind , and soon found that the landlord had not commended his preparations without good reason .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 39]: A mighty fire was blazing on the hearth and roaring up the wide chimney with a cheerful sound , which a large iron cauldron , bubbling and simmering in the heat , lent its pleasant aid to swell .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 84]: There was a deep red ruddy blush upon the room , and when the landlord stirred the fire , sending the flames skipping and leaping up -- when he took off the lid of the iron pot and there rushed out a savoury smell , while the bubbling sound grew deeper and more rich , and an unctuous steam came floating out , hanging in a delicious mist above their heads -- when he did this , Mr Codlin 's heart was touched .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 9]: He sat down in the chimney-corner and smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 52]: Mr Codlin sat smiling in the chimney-corner , eyeing the landlord as with a roguish look he held the cover in his hand , and , feigning that his doing so was needful to the welfare of the cookery , suffered the delightful steam to tickle the nostrils of his guest .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 38]: The glow of the fire was upon the landlord 's bald head , and upon his twinkling eye , and upon his watering mouth , and upon his pimpled face , and upon his round fat figure .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 22]: Mr Codlin drew his sleeve across his lips , and said in a murmuring voice , ` What is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 69]: ` It 's a stew of tripe , ' said the landlord smacking his lips , ` and cow-heel , ' smacking them again , ` and bacon , ' smacking them once more , ` and steak , ' smacking them for the fourth time , ` and peas , cauliflowers , new potatoes , and sparrow-grass , all working up together in one delicious gravy . '
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 46]: Having come to the climax , he smacked his lips a great many times , and taking a long hearty sniff of the fragrance that was hovering about , put on the cover again with the air of one whose toils on earth were over .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 10]: ` At what time will it be ready ? '
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 5]: asked Mr Codlin faintly .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 57]: ` It 'll be done to a turn , ' said the landlord looking up to the clock -- and the very clock had a colour in its fat white face , and looked a clock for jolly Sandboys to consult -- ` it 'll be done to a turn at twenty-two minutes before eleven . '
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 38]: ` Then , ' said Mr Codlin , ` fetch me a pint of warm ale , and do n't let nobody bring into the room even so much as a biscuit till the time arrives . '
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 58]: Nodding his approval of this decisive and manly course of procedure , the landlord retired to draw the beer , and presently returning with it , applied himself to warm the same in a small tin vessel shaped funnel-wise , for the convenience of sticking it far down in the fire and getting at the bright places .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 32]: This was soon done , and he handed it over to Mr Codlin with that creamy froth upon the surface which is one of the happy circumstances attendant on mulled malt .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 32]: Greatly softened by this soothing beverage , Mr Codlin now bethought him of his companions , and acquainted mine host of the Sandboys that their arrival might be shortly looked for .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 45]: The rain was rattling against the windows and pouring down in torrents , and such was Mr Codlin 's extreme amiability of mind , that he more than once expressed his earnest hope that they would not be so foolish as to get wet .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 48]: At length they arrived , drenched with the rain and presenting a most miserable appearance , notwithstanding that Short had sheltered the child as well as he could under the skirts of his own coat , and they were nearly breathless from the haste they had made .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 37]: But their steps were no sooner heard upon the road than the landlord , who had been at the outer door anxiously watching for their coming , rushed into the kitchen and took the cover off .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 5]: The effect was electrical .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 33]: They all came in with smiling faces though the wet was dripping from their clothes upon the floor , and Short 's first remark was , ` What a delicious smell ! '
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 24]: It is not very difficult to forget rain and mud by the side of a cheerful fire , and in a bright room .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 52]: They were furnished with slippers and such dry garments as the house or their own bundles afforded , and ensconcing themselves , as Mr Codlin had already done , in the warm chimney-corner , soon forgot their late troubles or only remembered them as enhancing the delights of the present time .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 31]: Overpowered by the warmth and comfort and the fatigue they had undergone , Nelly and the old man had not long taken their seats here , when they fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 6]: ` Who are they ? '
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 4]: whispered the landlord .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 11]: Short shook his head , and wished he knew himself .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 7]: ` Do n't you know ? '
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 9]: asked the host , turning to Mr Codlin .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 8]: ` Not I , ' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 10]: ` They 're no good , I suppose . '
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 10]: ` They 're no harm , ' said Short .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 5]: ` Depend upon that .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 62]: I tell you what -- it 's plain that the old man a n't in his right mind -- ' ` If you have n't got anything newer than that to say , ' growled Mr Codlin , glancing at the clock , ` you 'd better let us fix our minds upon the supper , and not disturb us . '
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 10]: ` Here me out , wo n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 4]: retorted his friend .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 21]: ` It 's very plain to me , besides , that they 're not used to this way of life .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 27]: Do n't tell me that that handsome child has been in the habit of prowling about as she 's done these last two or three days .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 5]: I know better . '
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 11]: ` Well , who DOES tell you she has ? '
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 38]: growled Mr Codlin , again glancing at the clock and from it to the cauldron , ` ca n't you think of anything more suitable to present circumstances than saying things and then contradicting 'em ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 26]: I wish somebody would give you your supper , ' returned Short , ` for there 'll be no peace till you 've got it .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 23]: Have you seen how anxious the old man is to get on -- always wanting to be furder away -- furder away .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 6]: Have you seen that ? '
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 4]: what then ? '
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 4]: muttered Thomas Codlin .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 9]: ` This , then , ' said Short .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 9]: ` He has given his friends the slip .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 48]: Mind what I say -- he has given his friends the slip , and persuaded this delicate young creetur all along of her fondness for him to be his guide and travelling companion -- where to , he knows no more than the man in the moon .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 11]: Now I 'm not a going to stand that . '
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 11]: ` YOU 'RE not a going to stand that ! '
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 43]: cried Mr Codlin , glancing at the clock again and pulling his hair with both hands in a kind of frenzy , but whether occasioned by his companion 's observation or the tardy pace of Time , it was difficult to determine .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 10]: ` Here 's a world to live in ! '
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 18]: ` I , ' repeated Short emphatically and slowly , ` am not a-going to stand it .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 40]: I am not a-going to see this fair young child a falling into bad hands , and getting among people that she 's no more fit for , than they are to get among angels as their ordinary chums .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 48]: Therefore when they dewelope an intention of parting company from us , I shall take measures for detaining of 'em , and restoring 'em to their friends , who I dare say have had their disconsolation pasted up on every wall in London by this time . '
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 69]: ` Short , ' said Mr Codlin , who with his head upon his hands , and his elbows on his knees , had been shaking himself impatiently from side to side up to this point and occasionally stamping on the ground , but who now looked up with eager eyes ; ` it 's possible that there may be uncommon good sense in what you 've said .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 22]: If there is , and there should be a reward , Short , remember that we 're partners in everything ! '
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 22]: His companion had only time to nod a brief assent to this position , for the child awoke at the instant .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 41]: They had drawn close together during the previous whispering , and now hastily separated and were rather awkwardly endeavouring to exchange some casual remarks in their usual tone , when strange footsteps were heard without , and fresh company entered .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 75]: These were no other than four very dismal dogs , who came pattering in one after the other , headed by an old bandy dog of particularly mournful aspect , who , stopping when the last of his followers had got as far as the door , erected himself upon his hind legs and looked round at his companions , who immediately stood upon their hind legs , in a grave and melancholy row .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 106]: Nor was this the only remarkable circumstance about these dogs , for each of them wore a kind of little coat of some gaudy colour trimmed with tarnished spangles , and one of them had a cap upon his head , tied very carefully under his chin , which had fallen down upon his nose and completely obscured one eye ; add to this , that the gaudy coats were all wet through and discoloured with rain , and that the wearers were splashed and dirty , and some idea may be formed of the unusual appearance of these new visitors to the Jolly Sandboys .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 34]: Neither Short nor the landlord nor Thomas Codlin , however , was in the least surprised , merely remarking that these were Jerry 's dogs and that Jerry could not be far behind .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 41]: So there the dogs stood , patiently winking and gaping and looking extremely hard at the boiling pot , until Jerry himself appeared , when they all dropped down at once and walked about the room in their natural manner .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 35]: This posture it must be confessed did not much improve their appearance , as their own personal tails and their coat tails -- both capital things in their way -- did not agree together .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 36]: Jerry , the manager of these dancing dogs , was a tall black-whiskered man in a velveteen coat , who seemed well known to the landlord and his guests and accosted them with great cordiality .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 44]: Disencumbering himself of a barrel organ which he placed upon a chair , and retaining in his hand a small whip wherewith to awe his company of comedians , he came up to the fire to dry himself , and entered into conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 14]: ` Your people do n't usually travel in character , do they ? '
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 11]: said Short , pointing to the dresses of the dogs .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 10]: ` It must come expensive if they do ? '
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 18]: ` No , ' replied Jerry , ` no , it 's not the custom with us .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 37]: But we 've been playing a little on the road to-day , and we come out with a new wardrobe at the races , so I did n't think it worth while to stop to undress .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 5]: Down , Pedro ! '
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 56]: This was addressed to the dog with the cap on , who being a new member of the company , and not quite certain of his duty , kept his unobscured eye anxiously on his master , and was perpetually starting upon his hind legs when there was no occasion , and falling down again .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 61]: ` I 've got a animal here , ' said Jerry , putting his hand into the capacious pocket of his coat , and diving into one corner as if he were feeling for a small orange or an apple or some such article , ' a animal here , wot I think you know something of , Short . '
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 13]: cried Short , ` let 's have a look at him . '
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 17]: ` Here he is , ' said Jerry , producing a little terrier from his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 14]: ` He was once a Toby of yours , war n't he ! '
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 35]: In some versions of the great drama of Punch there is a small dog -- a modern innovation -- supposed to be the private property of that gentleman , whose name is always Toby .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 101]: This Toby has been stolen in youth from another gentleman , and fraudulently sold to the confiding hero , who having no guile himself has no suspicion that it lurks in others ; but Toby , entertaining a grateful recollection of his old master , and scorning to attach himself to any new patrons , not only refuses to smoke a pipe at the bidding of Punch , but to mark his old fidelity more strongly , seizes him by the nose and wrings the same with violence , at which instance of canine attachment the spectators are deeply affected .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 97]: This was the character which the little terrier in question had once sustained ; if there had been any doubt upon the subject he would speedily have resolved it by his conduct ; for not only did he , on seeing Short , give the strongest tokens of recognition , but catching sight of the flat box he barked so furiously at the pasteboard nose which he knew was inside , that his master was obliged to gather him up and put him into his pocket again , to the great relief of the whole company .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 36]: The landlord now busied himself in laying the cloth , in which process Mr Codlin obligingly assisted by setting forth his own knife and fork in the most convenient place and establishing himself behind them .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 56]: When everything was ready , the landlord took off the cover for the last time , and then indeed there burst forth such a goodly promise of supper , that if he had offered to put it on again or had hinted at postponement , he would certainly have been sacrificed on his own hearth .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 51]: However , he did nothing of the kind , but instead thereof assisted a stout servant girl in turning the contents of the cauldron into a large tureen ; a proceeding which the dogs , proof against various hot splashes which fell upon their noses , watched with terrible eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 31]: At length the dish was lifted on the table , and mugs of ale having been previously set round , little Nell ventured to say grace , and supper began .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 49]: At this juncture the poor dogs were standing on their hind legs quite surprisingly ; the child , having pity on them , was about to cast some morsels of food to them before she tasted it herself , hungry though she was , when their master interposed .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 21]: ` No , my dear , no , not an atom from anybody 's hand but mine if you please .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 29]: That dog , ' said Jerry , pointing out the old leader of the troop , and speaking in a terrible voice , ` lost a halfpenny to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 7]: He goes without his supper . '
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 20]: The unfortunate creature dropped upon his fore-legs directly , wagged his tail , and looked imploringly at his master .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 30]: ` You must be more careful , Sir , ' said Jerry , walking coolly to the chair where he had placed the organ , and setting the stop .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 4]: ` Come here .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 23]: Now , Sir , you play away at that , while we have supper , and leave off if you dare . '
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 10]: The dog immediately began to grind most mournful music .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 35]: His master having shown him the whip resumed his seat and called up the others , who , at his directions , formed in a row , standing upright as a file of soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 14]: ` Now , gentlemen , ' said Jerry , looking at them attentively .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 10]: ` The dog whose name 's called , eats .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 11]: The dogs whose names a n't called , keep quiet .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 3]: Carlo ! '
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 25]: The lucky individual whose name was called , snapped up the morsel thrown towards him , but none of the others moved a muscle .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 13]: In this manner they were fed at the discretion of their master .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 28]: Meanwhile the dog in disgrace ground hard at the organ , sometimes in quick time , sometimes in slow , but never leaving off for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 53]: When the knives and forks rattled very much , or any of his fellows got an unusually large piece of fat , he accompanied the music with a short howl , but he immediately checked it on his master looking round , and applied himself with increased diligence to the Old Hundredth .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 47]: Chapter 19 Supper was not yet over , when there arrived at the Jolly Sandboys two more travellers bound for the same haven as the rest , who had been walking in the rain for some hours , and came in shining and heavy with water .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 79]: One of these was the proprietor of a giant , and a little lady without legs or arms , who had jogged forward in a van ; the other , a silent gentleman who earned his living by showing tricks upon the cards , and who had rather deranged the natural expression of his countenance by putting small leaden lozenges into his eyes and bringing them out at his mouth , which was one of his professional accomplishments .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 28]: The name of the first of these newcomers was Vuffin ; the other , probably as a pleasant satire upon his ugliness , was called Sweet William .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 29]: To render them as comfortable as he could , the landlord bestirred himself nimbly , and in a very short time both gentlemen were perfectly at their ease .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 7]: ` How 's the Giant ? '
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 12]: said Short , when they all sat smoking round the fire .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 13]: ` Rather weak upon his legs , ' returned Mr Vuffin . '
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 13]: I begin to be afraid he 's going at the knees . '
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 11]: ` That 's a bad look-out , ' said Short .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 3]: ` Aye !
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 15]: Bad indeed , ' replied Mr Vuffin , contemplating the fire with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 28]: ` Once get a giant shaky on his legs , and the public care no more about him than they do for a dead cabbage stalk . '
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 8]: ` What becomes of old giants ? '
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 12]: said Short , turning to him again after a little reflection .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 18]: ` They 're usually kept in carawans to wait upon the dwarfs , ' said Mr Vuffin .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 19]: ` The maintaining of 'em must come expensive , when they ca n't be shown , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 7]: remarked Short , eyeing him doubtfully .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 23]: ` It 's better that , than letting 'em go upon the parish or about the streets , '' said Mr Vuffin .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 13]: ` Once make a giant common and giants will never draw again .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 5]: Look at wooden legs .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 18]: If there was only one man with a wooden leg what a property he 'd be ! '
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 6]: ` So he would ! '
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 8]: observed the landlord and Short both together .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 7]: ` That 's very true . '
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 37]: ` Instead of which , ' pursued Mr Vuffin , ` if you was to advertise Shakspeare played entirely by wooden legs , ' it 's my belief you would n't draw a sixpence . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 11]: I do n't suppose you would , ' said Short .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 7]: And the landlord said so too .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 59]: ` This shows , you see , ' said Mr Vuffin , waving his pipe with an argumentative air , ` this shows the policy of keeping the used-up giants still in the carawans , where they get food and lodging for nothing , all their lives , and in general very glad they are to stop there .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 32]: There was one giant -- a black ` un -- as left his carawan some year ago and took to carrying coach-bills about London , making himself as cheap as crossing-sweepers .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 3]: He died .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 32]: I make no insinuation against anybody in particular , ' said Mr Vuffin , looking solemnly round , ` but he was ruining the trade ; -- and he died . '
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 26]: The landlord drew his breath hard , and looked at the owner of the dogs , who nodded and said gruffly that he remembered . '
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 16]: I know you do , Jerry , ' said Mr Vuffin with profound meaning . '
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 20]: I know you remember it , Jerry , and the universal opinion was , that it served him right .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 113]: Why , I remember the time when old Maunders as had three-and-twenty wans -- I remember the time when old Maunders had in his cottage in Spa Fields in the winter time , when the season was over , eight male and female dwarfs setting down to dinner every day , who was waited on by eight old giants in green coats , red smalls , blue cotton stockings , and high-lows : and there was one dwarf as had grown elderly and wicious who whenever his giant was n't quick enough to please him , used to stick pins in his legs , not being able to reach up any higher .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 15]: I know that 's a fact , for Maunders told it me himself . '
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 11]: ` What about the dwarfs when they get old ? '
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 4]: inquired the landlord .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 31]: ` The older a dwarf is , the better worth he is , ' returned Mr Vuffin ; ' a grey-headed dwarf , well wrinkled , is beyond all suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 12]: But a giant weak in the legs and not standing upright !
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 25]: -- keep him in the carawan , but never show him , never show him , for any persuasion that can be offered . '
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 77]: While Mr Vuffin and his two friends smoked their pipes and beguiled the time with such conversation as this , the silent gentleman sat in a warm corner , swallowing , or seeming to swallow , sixpennyworth of halfpence for practice , balancing a feather upon his nose , and rehearsing other feats of dexterity of that kind , without paying any regard whatever to the company , who in their turn left him utterly unnoticed .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 35]: At length the weary child prevailed upon her grandfather to retire , and they withdrew , leaving the company yet seated round the fire , and the dogs fast asleep at a humble distance .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 29]: After bidding the old man good night , Nell retired to her poor garret , but had scarcely closed the door , when it was gently tapped at .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 32]: She opened it directly , and was a little startled by the sight of Mr Thomas Codlin , whom she had left , to all appearance , fast asleep down stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 7]: ` What is the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 4]: said the child .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 14]: ` Nothing 's the matter , my dear , ' returned her visitor .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 6]: ` I 'm your friend .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 20]: Perhaps you have n't thought so , but it 's me that 's your friend -- not him . '
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 5]: ` Not who ? '
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 4]: the child inquired .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 6]: ` Short , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 37]: I tell you what , ' said Codlin , ` for all his having a kind of way with him that you 'd be very apt to like , I 'm the real , open-hearted man .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 12]: I may n't look it , but I am indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 28]: The child began to be alarmed , considering that the ale had taken effect upon Mr Codlin , and that this commendation of himself was the consequence .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 21]: ` Short 's very well , and seems kind , ' resumed the misanthrope , ` but he overdoes it .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 6]: Now I do n't . '
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 30]: Certainly if there were any fault in Mr Codlin 's usual deportment , it was that he rather underdid his kindness to those about him , than overdid it .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 14]: But the child was puzzled , and could not tell what to say .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 20]: ` Take my advice , ' said Codlin : ` do n't ask me why , but take it .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 16]: As long as you travel with us , keep as near me as you can .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 25]: Do n't offer to leave us -- not on any account -- but always stick to me and say that I 'm your friend .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 23]: Will you bear that in mind , my dear , and always say that it was me that was your friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 9]: ` Say so where -- and when ? '
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 5]: inquired the child innocently .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 39]: ` O , nowhere in particular , ' replied Codlin , a little put out as it seemed by the question ; ` I 'm only anxious that you should think me so , and do me justice .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 12]: You ca n't think what an interest I have in you .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 19]: Why did n't you tell me your little history -- that about you and the poor old gentleman ?
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 22]: I 'm the best adviser that ever was , and so interested in you -- so much more interested than Short .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 27]: I think they 're breaking up down stairs ; you need n't tell Short , you know , that we 've had this little talk together .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 4]: God bless you .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 4]: Recollect the friend .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 8]: Codlin 's the friend , not Short .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 21]: Short 's very well as far as he goes , but the real friend is Codlin -- not Short . '
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 35]: Eking out these professions with a number of benevolent and protecting looks and great fervour of manner , Thomas Codlin stole away on tiptoe , leaving the child in a state of extreme surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 33]: She was still ruminating upon his curious behaviour , when the floor of the crazy stairs and landing cracked beneath the tread of the other travellers who were passing to their beds .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 47]: When they had all passed , and the sound of their footsteps had died away , one of them returned , and after a little hesitation and rustling in the passage , as if he were doubtful what door to knock at , knocked at hers .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 10]: ` Yes , ' said the child from within .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 16]: ` It 's me -- Short ' -- a voice called through the keyhole . '
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 39]: I only wanted to say that we must be off early to-morrow morning , my dear , because unless we get the start of the dogs and the conjuror , the villages wo n't be worth a penny .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 13]: You 'll be sure to be stirring early and go with us ?
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 6]: I 'll call you . '
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 19]: The child answered in the affirmative , and returning his ` good night ' heard him creep away .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 50]: She felt some uneasiness at the anxiety of these men , increased by the recollection of their whispering together down stairs and their slight confusion when she awoke , nor was she quite free from a misgiving that they were not the fittest companions she could have stumbled on .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 21]: Her uneasiness , however , was nothing , weighed against her fatigue ; and she soon forgot it in sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 83]: Very early next morning , Short fulfilled his promise , and knocking softly at her door , entreated that she would get up directly , as the proprietor of the dogs was still snoring , and if they lost no time they might get a good deal in advance both of him and the conjuror , who was talking in his sleep , and from what he could be heard to say , appeared to be balancing a donkey in his dreams .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 37]: She started from her bed without delay , and roused the old man with so much expedition that they were both ready as soon as Short himself , to that gentleman 's unspeakable gratification and relief .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 37]: After a very unceremonious and scrambling breakfast , of which the staple commodities were bacon and bread , and beer , they took leave of the landlord and issued from the door of the jolly Sandboys .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 35]: The morning was fine and warm , the ground cool to the feet after the late rain , the hedges gayer and more green , the air clear , and everything fresh and healthful .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 11]: Surrounded by these influences , they walked on pleasantly enough .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 83]: They had not gone very far , when the child was again struck by the altered behaviour of Mr Thomas Codlin , who instead of plodding on sulkily by himself as he had heretofore done , kept close to her , and when he had an opportunity of looking at her unseen by his companion , warned her by certain wry faces and jerks of the head not to put any trust in Short , but to reserve all confidences for Codlin .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 74]: Neither did he confine himself to looks and gestures , for when she and her grandfather were walking on beside the aforesaid Short , and that little man was talking with his accustomed cheerfulness on a variety of indifferent subjects , Thomas Codlin testified his jealousy and distrust by following close at her heels , and occasionally admonishing her ankles with the legs of the theatre in a very abrupt and painful manner .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 86]: All these proceedings naturally made the child more watchful and suspicious , and she soon observed that whenever they halted to perform outside a village alehouse or other place , Mr Codlin while he went through his share of the entertainments kept his eye steadily upon her and the old man , or with a show of great friendship and consideration invited the latter to lean upon his arm , and so held him tight until the representation was over and they again went forward .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 26]: Even Short seemed to change in this respect , and to mingle with his good-nature something of a desire to keep them in safe custody .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 16]: This increased the child 's misgivings , and made her yet more anxious and uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 91]: Meanwhile , they were drawing near the town where the races were to begin next day ; for , from passing numerous groups of gipsies and trampers on the road , wending their way towards it , and straggling out from every by-way and cross-country lane , they gradually fell into a stream of people , some walking by the side of covered carts , others with horses , others with donkeys , others toiling on with heavy loads upon their backs , but all tending to the same point .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 48]: The public-houses by the wayside , from being empty and noiseless as those in the remoter parts had been , now sent out boisterous shouts and clouds of smoke ; and , from the misty windows , clusters of broad red faces looked down upon the road .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 79]: On every piece of waste or common ground , some small gambler drove his noisy trade , and bellowed to the idle passersby to stop and try their chance ; the crowd grew thicker and more noisy ; gilt gingerbread in blanket-stalls exposed its glories to the dust ; and often a four-horse carriage , dashing by , obscured all objects in the gritty cloud it raised , and left them , stunned and blinded , far behind .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 20]: It was dark before they reached the town itself , and long indeed the few last miles had been .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 47]: Here all was tumult and confusion ; the streets were filled with throngs of people -- many strangers were there , it seemed , by the looks they cast about -- the church-bells rang out their noisy peals , and flags streamed from windows and house-tops .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 44]: In the large inn-yards waiters flitted to and fro and ran against each other , horses clattered on the uneven stones , carriage steps fell rattling down , and sickening smells from many dinners came in a heavy lukewarm breath upon the sense .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 79]: In the smaller public-houses , fiddles with all their might and main were squeaking out the tune to staggering feet ; drunken men , oblivious of the burden of their song , joined in a senseless howl , which drowned the tinkling of the feeble bell and made them savage for their drink ; vagabond groups assembled round the doors to see the stroller woman dance , and add their uproar to the shrill flageolet and deafening drum .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 48]: Through this delirious scene , the child , frightened and repelled by all she saw , led on her bewildered charge , clinging close to her conductor , and trembling lest in the press she should be separated from him and left to find her way alone .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 47]: Quickening their steps to get clear of all the roar and riot , they at length passed through the town and made for the race-course , which was upon an open heath , situated on an eminence , a full mile distant from its furthest bounds .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 118]: Although there were many people here , none of the best favoured or best clad , busily erecting tents and driving stakes in the ground , and hurrying to and fro with dusty feet and many a grumbled oath -- although there were tired children cradled on heaps of straw between the wheels of carts , crying themselves to sleep -- and poor lean horses and donkeys just turned loose , grazing among the men and women , and pots and kettles , and half-lighted fires , and ends of candles flaring and wasting in the air -- for all this , the child felt it an escape from the town and drew her breath more freely .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 66]: After a scanty supper , the purchase of which reduced her little stock so low , that she had only a few halfpence with which to buy a breakfast on the morrow , she and the old man lay down to rest in a corner of a tent , and slept , despite the busy preparations that were going on around them all night long .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 15]: And now they had come to the time when they must beg their bread .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 54]: Soon after sunrise in the morning she stole out from the tent , and rambling into some fields at a short distance , plucked a few wild roses and such humble flowers , purposing to make them into little nosegays and offer them to the ladies in the carriages when the company arrived .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 91]: Her thoughts were not idle while she was thus employed ; when she returned and was seated beside the old man in one corner of the tent , tying her flowers together , while the two men lay dozing in another corner , she plucked him by the sleeve , and slightly glancing towards them , said , in a low voice -- ` Grandfather , do n't look at those I talk of , and do n't seem as if I spoke of anything but what I am about .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 13]: What was that you told me before we left the old house ?
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 24]: That if they knew what we were going to do , they would say that you were mad , and part us ? '
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 55]: The old man turned to her with an aspect of wild terror ; but she checked him by a look , and bidding him hold some flowers while she tied them up , and so bringing her lips closer to his ear , said -- ' I know that was what you told me .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 7]: You need n't speak , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 6]: I recollect it very well .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 10]: It was not likely that I should forget it .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 31]: Grandfather , these men suspect that we have secretly left our friends , and mean to carry us before some gentleman and have us taken care of and sent back .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 32]: If you let your hand tremble so , we can never get away from them , but if you 're only quiet now , we shall do so , easily . '
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 4]: ` How ? '
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 5]: muttered the old man .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 6]: ` Dear Nelly , how ?
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 38]: They will shut me up in a stone room , dark and cold , and chain me up to the wall , Nell -- flog me with whips , and never let me see thee more ! '
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 11]: ` You 're trembling again , ' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 8]: ` Keep close to me all day .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 13]: Never mind them , do n't look at them , but me .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 11]: I shall find a time when we can steal away .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 19]: When I do , mind you come with me , and do not stop or speak a word .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 5]: That 's all . '
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 3]: ` Halloa !
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 10]: what are you up to , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 11]: said Mr Codlin , raising his head , and yawning .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 28]: Then observing that his companion was fast asleep , he added in an earnest whisper , ` Codlin 's the friend , remember -- not Short . '
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 27]: ` Making some nosegays , ' the child replied ; ' I am going to try and sell some , these three days of the races .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 12]: Will you have one -- as a present I mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 22]: Mr Codlin would have risen to receive it , but the child hurried towards him and placed it in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 45]: He stuck it in his buttonhole with an air of ineffable complacency for a misanthrope , and leering exultingly at the unconscious Short , muttered , as he laid himself down again , ` Tom Codlin 's the friend , by G -- ! '
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 28]: As the morning wore on , the tents assumed a gayer and more brilliant appearance , and long lines of carriages came rolling softly on the turf .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 50]: Men who had lounged about all night in smock-frocks and leather leggings , came out in silken vests and hats and plumes , as jugglers or mountebanks ; or in gorgeous liveries as soft-spoken servants at gambling booths ; or in sturdy yeoman dress as decoys at unlawful games .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 44]: Black-eyed gipsy girls , hooded in showy handkerchiefs , sallied forth to tell fortunes , and pale slender women with consumptive faces lingered upon the footsteps of ventriloquists and conjurors , and counted the sixpences with anxious eyes long before they were gained .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 73]: As many of the children as could be kept within bounds , were stowed away , with all the other signs of dirt and poverty , among the donkeys , carts , and horses ; and as many as could not be thus disposed of ran in and out in all intricate spots , crept between people 's legs and carriage wheels , and came forth unharmed from under horses ' hoofs .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 50]: The dancing-dogs , the stilts , the little lady and the tall man , and all the other attractions , with organs out of number and bands innumerable , emerged from the holes and corners in which they had passed the night , and flourished boldly in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 54]: Along the uncleared course , Short led his party , sounding the brazen trumpet and revelling in the voice of Punch ; and at his heels went Thomas Codlin , bearing the show as usual , and keeping his eye on Nelly and her grandfather , as they rather lingered in the rear .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 34]: The child bore upon her arm the little basket with her flowers , and sometimes stopped , with timid and modest looks , to offer them at some gay carriage ; but alas !
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 48]: there were many bolder beggars there , gipsies who promised husbands , and other adepts in their trade , and although some ladies smiled gently as they shook their heads , and others cried to the gentlemen beside them ` See , what a pretty face ! '
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 18]: they let the pretty face pass on , and never thought that it looked tired or hungry .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 55]: There was but one lady who seemed to understand the child , and she was one who sat alone in a handsome carriage , while two young men in dashing clothes , who had just dismounted from it , talked and laughed loudly at a little distance , appearing to forget her , quite .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 37]: There were many ladies all around , but they turned their backs , or looked another way , or at the two young men -LRB- not unfavourably at them -RRB- , and left her to herself .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 56]: She motioned away a gipsy-woman urgent to tell her fortune , saying that it was told already and had been for some years , but called the child towards her , and taking her flowers put money into her trembling hand , and bade her go home and keep at home for God 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 53]: Many a time they went up and down those long , long lines , seeing everything but the horses and the race ; when the bell rang to clear the course , going back to rest among the carts and donkeys , and not coming out again until the heat was over .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 38]: Many a time , too , was Punch displayed in the full zenith of his humour , but all this while the eye of Thomas Codlin was upon them , and to escape without notice was impracticable .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 31]: At length , late in the day , Mr Codlin pitched the show in a convenient spot , and the spectators were soon in the very triumph of the scene .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 76]: The child , sitting down with the old man close behind it , had been thinking how strange it was that horses who were such fine honest creatures should seem to make vagabonds of all the men they drew about them , when a loud laugh at some extemporaneous witticism of Mr Short 's , having allusion to the circumstances of the day , roused her from her meditation and caused her to look around .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 15]: If they were ever to get away unseen , that was the very moment .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 57]: Short was plying the quarter-staves vigorously and knocking the characters in the fury of the combat against the sides of the show , the people were looking on with laughing faces , and Mr Codlin had relaxed into a grim smile as his roving eye detected hands going into waistcoat pockets and groping secretly for sixpences .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 15]: If they were ever to get away unseen , that was the very moment .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 7]: They seized it , and fled .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 21]: They made a path through booths and carriages and throngs of people , and never once stopped to look behind .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 57]: The bell was ringing and the course was cleared by the time they reached the ropes , but they dashed across it insensible to the shouts and screeching that assailed them for breaking in upon its sanctity , and creeping under the brow of the hill at a quick pace , made for the open fields .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 51]: Chapter 20 Day after day as he bent his steps homeward , returning from some new effort to procure employment , Kit raised his eyes to the window of the little room he had so much commended to the child , and hoped to see some indication of her presence .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 52]: His own earnest wish , coupled with the assurance he had received from Quilp , filled him with the belief that she would yet arrive to claim the humble shelter he had offered , and from the death of each day 's hope another hope sprung up to live to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 12]: I think they must certainly come to-morrow , eh mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 17]: said Kit , laying aside his hat with a weary air and sighing as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 8]: ` They have been gone a week .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 16]: They surely could n't stop away more than a week , could they now ? '
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 17]: The mother shook her head , and reminded him how often he had been disappointed already .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 26]: ` For the matter of that , ' said Kit , ` you speak true and sensible enough , as you always do , mother .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 26]: Still , I do consider that a week is quite long enough for 'em to be rambling about ; do n't you say so ? '
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 22]: ` Quite long enough , Kit , longer than enough , but they may not come back for all that . '
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 33]: Kit was for a moment disposed to be vexed by this contradiction , and not the less so from having anticipated it in his own mind and knowing how just it was .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 22]: But the impulse was only momentary , and the vexed look became a kind one before it had crossed the room .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 14]: ` Then what do you think , mother , has become of 'em ?
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 13]: You do n't think they 've gone to sea , anyhow ? '
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 16]: ` Not gone for sailors , certainly , ' returned the mother with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 18]: ` But I ca n't help thinking that they have gone to some foreign country . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 22]: I say , ' cried Kit with a rueful face , ` do n't talk like that , mother . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 16]: I am afraid they have , and that 's the truth , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 60]: ` It 's the talk of all the neighbours , and there are some even that know of their having been seen on board ship , and can tell you the name of the place they 've gone to , which is more than I can , my dear , for it 's a very hard one . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 10]: I do n't believe it , ' said Kit .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 7]: ` Not a word of it .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 12]: A set of idle chatterboxes , how should they know ! '
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 103]: ` They may be wrong of course , ' returned the mother , ' I ca n't tell about that , though I do n't think it 's at all unlikely that they 're in the right , for the talk is that the old gentleman had put by a little money that nobody knew of , not even that ugly little man you talk to me about -- what 's his name -- Quilp ; and that he and Miss Nell have gone to live abroad where it ca n't be taken from them , and they will never be disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 16]: That do n't seem very far out of the way now , do it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 37]: Kit scratched his head mournfully , in reluctant admission that it did not , and clambering up to the old nail took down the cage and set himself to clean it and to feed the bird .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 53]: His thoughts reverting from this occupation to the little old gentleman who had given him the shilling , he suddenly recollected that that was the very day -- nay , nearly the very hour -- at which the little old gentleman had said he should be at the Notary 's house again .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 35]: He no sooner remembered this , than he hung up the cage with great precipitation , and hastily explaining the nature of his errand , went off at full speed to the appointed place .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 65]: It was some two minutes after the time when he reached the spot , which was a considerable distance from his home , but by great good luck the little old gentleman had not yet arrived ; at least there was no pony-chaise to be seen , and it was not likely that he had come and gone again in so short a space .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 31]: Greatly relieved to find that he was not too late , Kit leant against a lamp-post to take breath , and waited the advent of the pony and his charge .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 51]: Sure enough , before long the pony came trotting round the corner of the street , looking as obstinate as pony might , and picking his steps as if he were spying about for the cleanest places , and would by no means dirty his feet or hurry himself inconveniently .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 33]: Behind the pony sat the little old gentleman , and by the old gentleman 's side sat the little old lady , carrying just such a nosegay as she had brought before .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 72]: The old gentleman , the old lady , the pony , and the chaise , came up the street in perfect unanimity , until they arrived within some half a dozen doors of the Notary 's house , when the pony , deceived by a brass-plate beneath a tailor 's knocker , came to a halt , and maintained by a sturdy silence , that that was the house they wanted .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 27]: ` Now , Sir , will you ha ' the goodness to go on ; this is not the place , ' said the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 24]: The pony looked with great attention into a fire-plug which was near him , and appeared to be quite absorbed in contemplating it .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 14]: ` Oh dear , such a naughty Whisker '' cried the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 13]: ` After being so good too , and coming along so well !
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 7]: I am quite ashamed of him .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 18]: I do n't know what we are to do with him , I really do n't . '
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 64]: The pony having thoroughly satisfied himself as to the nature and properties of the fire-plug , looked into the air after his old enemies the flies , and as there happened to be one of them tickling his ear at that moment he shook his head and whisked his tail , after which he appeared full of thought but quite comfortable and collected .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 75]: The old gentleman having exhausted his powers of persuasion , alighted to lead him ; whereupon the pony , perhaps because he held this to be a sufficient concession , perhaps because he happened to catch sight of the other brass-plate , or perhaps because he was in a spiteful humour , darted off with the old lady and stopped at the right house , leaving the old gentleman to come panting on behind .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 21]: It was then that Kit presented himself at the pony 's head , and touched his hat with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 18]: ` Why , bless me , ' cried the old gentleman , ` the lad is here !
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 9]: My dear , do you see ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 19]: I said I 'd be here , Sir , ' said Kit , patting Whisker 's neck . '
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 11]: I hope you 've had a pleasant ride , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 9]: He 's a very nice little pony . '
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 10]: ` My dear , ' said the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 16]: ` This is an uncommon lad ; a good lad , I 'm sure . '
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 14]: ` I 'm sure he is , ' rejoined the old lady . '
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 16]: A very good lad , and I am sure he is a good son . '
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 16]: Kit acknowledged these expressions of confidence by touching his hat again and blushing very much .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 39]: The old gentleman then handed the old lady out , and after looking at him with an approving smile , they went into the house -- talking about him as they went , Kit could not help feeling .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 74]: Presently Mr Witherden , smelling very hard at the nosegay , came to the window and looked at him , and after that Mr Abel came and looked at him , and after that the old gentleman and lady came and looked at him again , and after that they all came and looked at him together , which Kit , feeling very much embarrassed by , made a pretence of not observing .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 18]: Therefore he patted the pony more and more ; and this liberty the pony most handsomely permitted .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 63]: The faces had not disappeared from the window many moments , when Mr Chuckster in his official coat , and with his hat hanging on his head just as it happened to fall from its peg , appeared upon the pavement , and telling him he was wanted inside , bade him go in and he would mind the chaise the while .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 55]: In giving him this direction Mr Chuckster remarked that he wished that he might be blessed if he could make out whether he -LRB- Kit -RRB- was ` precious raw ' or ` precious deep , ' but intimated by a distrustful shake of the head , that he inclined to the latter opinion .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 41]: Kit entered the office in a great tremor , for he was not used to going among strange ladies and gentlemen , and the tin boxes and bundles of dusty papers had in his eyes an awful and venerable air .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 26]: Mr Witherden too was a bustling gentleman who talked loud and fast , and all eyes were upon him , and he was very shabby .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 28]: ` Well , boy , ' said Mr Witherden , ` you came to work out that shilling ; -- not to get another , hey ? '
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 17]: ` No indeed , sir , ' replied Kit , taking courage to look up . '
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 9]: I never thought of such a thing . '
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 5]: ` Father alive ? '
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 4]: said the Notary .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 6]: ` Dead , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 4]: ` Mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 6]: ` Yes , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 7]: ` Married again -- eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 40]: Kit made answer , not without some indignation , that she was a widow with three children , and that as to her marrying again , if the gentleman knew her he would n't think of such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 36]: At this reply Mr Witherden buried his nose in the flowers again , and whispered behind the nosegay to the old gentleman that he believed the lad was as honest a lad as need be .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 60]: ` Now , ' said Mr Garland when they had made some further inquiries of him , ' I am not going to give you anything -- ' ` Thank you , sir , ' Kit replied ; and quite seriously too , for this announcement seemed to free him from the suspicion which the Notary had hinted . '
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 39]: -- But , ' resumed the old gentleman , ` perhaps I may want to know something more about you , so tell me where you live , and I 'll put it down in my pocket-book . '
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 16]: Kit told him , and the old gentleman wrote down the address with his pencil .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 45]: He had scarcely done so , when there was a great uproar in the street , and the old lady hurrying to the window cried that Whisker had run away , upon which Kit darted out to the rescue , and the others followed .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 59]: It seemed that Mr Chuckster had been standing with his hands in his pockets looking carelessly at the pony , and occasionally insulting him with such admonitions as ` Stand still , ' -- ` Be quiet , ' -- ` Wo-a-a , ' and the like , which by a pony of spirit can not be borne .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 84]: Consequently , the pony being deterred by no considerations of duty or obedience , and not having before him the slightest fear of the human eye , had at length started off , and was at that moment rattling down the street -- Mr Chuckster , with his hat off and a pen behind his ear , hanging on in the rear of the chaise and making futile attempts to draw it the other way , to the unspeakable admiration of all beholders .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 44]: Even in running away , however , Whisker was perverse , for he had not gone very far when he suddenly stopped , and before assistance could be rendered , commenced backing at nearly as quick a pace as he had gone forward .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 31]: By these means Mr Chuckster was pushed and hustled to the office again , in a most inglorious manner , and arrived in a state of great exhaustion and discomfiture .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 23]: The old lady then stepped into her seat , and Mr Abel -LRB- whom they had come to fetch -RRB- into his .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 67]: The old gentleman , after reasoning with the pony on the extreme impropriety of his conduct , and making the best amends in his power to Mr Chuckster , took his place also , and they drove away , waving a farewell to the Notary and his clerk , and more than once turning to nod kindly to Kit as he watched them from the road .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 60]: Chapter 21 Kit turned away and very soon forgot the pony , and the chaise , and the little old lady , and the little old gentleman , and the little young gentleman to boot , in thinking what could have become of his late master and his lovely grandchild , who were the fountain-head of all his meditations .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 60]: Still casting about for some plausible means of accounting for their non-appearance , and of persuading himself that they must soon return , he bent his steps towards home , intending to finish the task which the sudden recollection of his contract had interrupted , and then to sally forth once more to seek his fortune for the day .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 23]: When he came to the corner of the court in which he lived , lo and behold there was the pony again !
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 58]: Yes , there he was , looking more obstinate than ever ; and alone in the chaise , keeping a steady watch upon his every wink , sat Mr Abel , who , lifting up his eyes by chance and seeing Kit pass by , nodded to him as though he would have nodded his head off .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 86]: Kit wondered to see the pony again , so near his own home too , but it never occurred to him for what purpose the pony might have come there , or where the old lady and the old gentleman had gone , until he lifted the latch of the door , and walking in , found them seated in the room in conversation with his mother , at which unexpected sight he pulled off his hat and made his best bow in some confusion .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 18]: ` We are here before you , you see , Christopher , ' said Mr Garland smiling .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 27]: ` Yes , sir , ' said Kit ; and as he said it , he looked towards his mother for an explanation of the visit .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 111]: ` The gentleman 's been kind enough , my dear , ' said she , in reply to this mute interrogation , ` to ask me whether you were in a good place , or in any place at all , and when I told him no , you were not in any , he was so good as to say that -- ' ' -- That we wanted a good lad in our house , ' said the old gentleman and the old lady both together , ` and that perhaps we might think of it , if we found everything as we would wish it to be . '
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 59]: As this thinking of it , plainly meant the thinking of engaging Kit , he immediately partook of his mother 's anxiety and fell into a great flutter ; for the little old couple were very methodical and cautious , and asked so many questions that he began to be afraid there was no chance of his success .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 77]: ` You see , my good woman , ' said Mrs Garland to Kit 's mother , ` that it 's necessary to be very careful and particular in such a matter as this , for we 're only three in family , and are very quiet regular folks , and it would be a sad thing if we made any kind of mistake , and found things different from what we hoped and expected . '
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 203]: To this , Kit 's mother replied , that certainly it was quite true , and quite right , and quite proper , and Heaven forbid that she should shrink , or have cause to shrink , from any inquiry into her character or that of her son , who was a very good son though she was his mother , in which respect , she was bold to say , he took after his father , who was not only a good son to HIS mother , but the best of husbands and the best of fathers besides , which Kit could and would corroborate she knew , and so would little Jacob and the baby likewise if they were old enough , which unfortunately they were not , though as they did n't know what a loss they had had , perhaps it was a great deal better that they should be as young as they were ; and so Kit 's mother wound up a long story by wiping her eyes with her apron , and patting little Jacob 's head , who was rocking the cradle and staring with all his might at the strange lady and gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 77]: When Kit 's mother had done speaking , the old lady struck in again , and said that she was quite sure she was a very honest and very respectable person or she never would have expressed herself in that manner , and that certainly the appearance of the children and the cleanliness of the house deserved great praise and did her the utmost credit , whereat Kit 's mother dropped a curtsey and became consoled .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 172]: Then the good woman entered in a long and minute account of Kit 's life and history from the earliest period down to that time , not omitting to make mention of his miraculous fall out of a back-parlour window when an infant of tender years , or his uncommon sufferings in a state of measles , which were illustrated by correct imitations of the plaintive manner in which he called for toast and water , day and night , and said , ` do n't cry , mother , I shall soon be better ; ' for proof of which statements reference was made to Mrs Green , lodger , at the cheesemonger 's round the corner , and divers other ladies and gentlemen in various parts of England and Wales -LRB- and one Mr Brown who was supposed to be then a corporal in the East Indies , and who could of course be found with very little trouble -RRB- , within whose personal knowledge the circumstances had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 95]: This narration ended , Mr Garland put some questions to Kit respecting his qualifications and general acquirements , while Mrs Garland noticed the children , and hearing from Kit 's mother certain remarkable circumstances which had attended the birth of each , related certain other remarkable circumstances which had attended the birth of her own son , Mr Abel , from which it appeared that both Kit 's mother and herself had been , above and beyond all other women of what condition or age soever , peculiarly hemmed in with perils and dangers .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 58]: Lastly , inquiry was made into the nature and extent of Kit 's wardrobe , and a small advance being made to improve the same , he was formally hired at an annual income of Six Pounds , over and above his board and lodging , by Mr and Mrs Garland , of Abel Cottage , Finchley .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 33]: It would be difficult to say which party appeared most pleased with this arrangement , the conclusion of which was hailed with nothing but pleasant looks and cheerful smiles on both sides .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 84]: It was settled that Kit should repair to his new abode on the next day but one , in the morning ; and finally , the little old couple , after bestowing a bright half-crown on little Jacob and another on the baby , took their leaves ; being escorted as far as the street by their new attendant , who held the obdurate pony by the bridle while they took their seats , and saw them drive away with a lightened heart .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 27]: ` Well , mother , ' said Kit , hurrying back into the house , ' I think my fortune 's about made now . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 14]: I should think it was indeed , Kit , ' rejoined his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 6]: ` Six pound a year !
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 4]: Only think ! '
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 26]: said Kit , trying to maintain the gravity which the consideration of such a sum demanded , but grinning with delight in spite of himself .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 7]: ` There 's a property ! '
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 53]: Kit drew a long breath when he had said this , and putting his hands deep into his pockets as if there were one year 's wages at least in each , looked at his mother , as though he saw through her , and down an immense perspective of sovereigns beyond .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 16]: ` Please God we 'll make such a lady of you for Sundays , mother !
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 22]: such a scholar of Jacob , such a child of the baby , such a room of the one up stairs !
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 6]: Six pound a year ! '
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 4]: ` Hem ! '
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 5]: croaked a strange voice .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 10]: ` What 's that about six pound a year ?
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 8]: What about six pound a year ? '
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 19]: And as the voice made this inquiry , Daniel Quilp walked in with Richard Swiveller at his heels .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 13]: ` Who said he was to have six pound a year ? '
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 7]: said Quilp , looking sharply round .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 15]: ` Did the old man say it , or did little Nell say it ?
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 17]: And what 's he to have it for , and where are they , eh ! '
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 68]: The good woman was so much alarmed by the sudden apparition of this unknown piece of ugliness , that she hastily caught the baby from its cradle and retreated into the furthest corner of the room ; while little Jacob , sitting upon his stool with his hands on his knees , looked full at him in a species of fascination , roaring lustily all the time .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 37]: Richard Swiveller took an easy observation of the family over Mr Quilp 's head , and Quilp himself , with his hands in his pockets , smiled in an exquisite enjoyment of the commotion he occasioned .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 16]: ` Do n't be frightened , mistress , ' said Quilp , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 18]: ` Your son knows me ; I do n't eat babies ; I do n't like 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 24]: It will be as well to stop that young screamer though , in case I should be tempted to do him a mischief .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 4]: Holloa , sir !
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 6]: Will you be quiet ? '
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 25]: Little Jacob stemmed the course of two tears which he was squeezing out of his eyes , and instantly subsided into a silent horror .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 38]: ` Mind you do n't break out again , you villain , ' said Quilp , looking sternly at him , ` or I 'll make faces at you and throw you into fits , I will .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 16]: Now you sir , why have n't you been to me as you promised ? '
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 8]: ` What should I come for ? '
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 4]: retorted Kit . '
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 17]: I had n't any business with you , no more than you had with me . '
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 21]: ` Here , mistress , ' said Quilp , turning quickly away , and appealing from Kit to his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 12]: ` When did his old master come or send here last ?
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 5]: Is he here now ?
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 9]: If not , where 's he gone ? '
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 14]: ` He has not been here at all , ' she replied . '
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 27]: I wish we knew where they have gone , for it would make my son a good deal easier in his mind , and me too .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 29]: If you 're the gentleman named Mr Quilp , I should have thought you 'd have known , and so I told him only this very day . '
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 4]: ` Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 12]: muttered Quilp , evidently disappointed to believe that this was true .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 14]: ` That 's what you tell this gentleman too , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 38]: ` If the gentleman comes to ask the same question , I ca n't tell him anything else , sir ; and I only wish I could , for our own sakes , ' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 31]: Quilp glanced at Richard Swiveller , and observed that having met him on the threshold , he assumed that he had come in search of some intelligence of the fugitives .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 6]: He supposed he was right ?
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 17]: ` Yes , ' said Dick , ` that was the object of the present expedition .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 14]: I fancied it possible -- but let us go ring fancy 's knell .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 6]: I 'll begin it . '
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 10]: ` You seem disappointed , ' observed Quilp . '
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 17]: A baffler , Sir , a baffler , that 's all , ' returned Dick . '
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 30]: I have entered upon a speculation which has proved a baffler ; and a Being of brightness and beauty will be offered up a sacrifice at Cheggs 's altar .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 7]: That 's all , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 40]: The dwarf eyed Richard with a sarcastic smile , but Richard , who had been taking a rather strong lunch with a friend , observed him not , and continued to deplore his fate with mournful and despondent looks .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 39]: Quilp plainly discerned that there was some secret reason for this visit and his uncommon disappointment , and , in the hope that there might be means of mischief lurking beneath it , resolved to worm it out .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 32]: He had no sooner adopted this resolution , than he conveyed as much honesty into his face as it was capable of expressing , and sympathised with Mr Swiveller exceedingly . '
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 44]: I am disappointed myself , ' said Quilp , ` out of mere friendly feeling for them ; but you have real reasons , private reasons I have no doubt , for your disappointment , and therefore it comes heavier than mine . '
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 14]: ` Why , of course it does , ' Dick observed , testily .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 13]: ` Upon my word , I 'm very sorry , very sorry .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 7]: I 'm rather cast down myself .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 19]: As we are companions in adversity , shall we be companions in the surest way of forgetting it ?
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 77]: If you had no particular business , now , to lead you in another direction , ' urged Quilp , plucking him by the sleeve and looking slyly up into his face out of the corners of his eyes , ` there is a house by the water-side where they have some of the noblest Schiedam -- reputed to be smuggled , but that 's between ourselves -- that can be got in all the world .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 5]: The landlord knows me .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 77]: There 's a little summer-house overlooking the river , where we might take a glass of this delicious liquor with a whiff of the best tobacco -- it 's in this case , and of the rarest quality , to my certain knowledge -- and be perfectly snug and happy , could we possibly contrive it ; or is there any very particular engagement that peremptorily takes you another way , Mr Swiveller , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 20]: As the dwarf spoke , Dick 's face relaxed into a compliant smile , and his brows slowly unbent .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 44]: By the time he had finished , Dick was looking down at Quilp in the same sly manner as Quilp was looking up at him , and there remained nothing more to be done but to set out for the house in question .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 6]: This they did , straightway .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 24]: The moment their backs were turned , little Jacob thawed , and resumed his crying from the point where Quilp had frozen him .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 35]: The summer-house of which Mr Quilp had spoken was a rugged wooden box , rotten and bare to see , which overhung the river 's mud , and threatened to slide down into it .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 75]: The tavern to which it belonged was a crazy building , sapped and undermined by the rats , and only upheld by great bars of wood which were reared against its walls , and had propped it up so long that even they were decaying and yielding with their load , and of a windy night might be heard to creak and crack as if the whole fabric were about to come toppling down .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 45]: The house stood -- if anything so old and feeble could be said to stand -- on a piece of waste ground , blighted with the unwholesome smoke of factory chimneys , and echoing the clank of iron wheels and rush of troubled water .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 11]: Its internal accommodations amply fulfilled the promise of the outside .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 42]: The rooms were low and damp , the clammy walls were pierced with chinks and holes , the rotten floors had sunk from their level , the very beams started from their places and warned the timid stranger from their neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 53]: To this inviting spot , entreating him to observe its beauties as they passed along , Mr Quilp led Richard Swiveller , and on the table of the summer-house , scored deep with many a gallows and initial letter , there soon appeared a wooden keg , full of the vaunted liquor .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 62]: Drawing it off into the glasses with the skill of a practised hand , and mixing it with about a third part of water , Mr Quilp assigned to Richard Swiveller his portion , and lighting his pipe from an end of a candle in a very old and battered lantern , drew himself together upon a seat and puffed away .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 6]: ` Is it good ? '
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 17]: said Quilp , as Richard Swiveller smacked his lips , ` is it strong and fiery ?
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 24]: Does it make you wink , and choke , and your eyes water , and your breath come short -- does it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 5]: ` Does it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 41]: cried Dick , throwing away part of the contents of his glass , and filling it up with water , ` why , man , you do n't mean to tell me that you drink such fire as this ? '
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 8]: rejoined Quilp , ` Not drink it !
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 3]: Look here .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 3]: And here .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 4]: And here again .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 5]: Not drink it ! '
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 48]: As he spoke , Daniel Quilp drew off and drank three small glassfuls of the raw spirit , and then with a horrible grimace took a great many pulls at his pipe , and swallowing the smoke , discharged it in a heavy cloud from his nose .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 16]: This feat accomplished he drew himself together in his former position , and laughed excessively .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 7]: ` Give us a toast ! '
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 31]: cried Quilp , rattling on the table in a dexterous manner with his fist and elbow alternately , in a kind of tune , ' a woman , a beauty .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 17]: Let 's have a beauty for our toast and empty our glasses to the last drop .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 6]: Her name , come ! '
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 18]: ` If you want a name , ' said Dick , ` here 's Sophy Wackles . '
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 32]: ` Sophy Wackles , ' screamed the dwarf , ` Miss Sophy Wackles that is -- Mrs Richard Swiveller that shall be -- that shall be -- ha ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 24]: said Dick , ` you might have said that a few weeks ago , but it wo n't do now , my buck .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 24]: Immolating herself upon the shrine of Cheggs -- ' ` Poison Cheggs , cut Cheggs 's ears off , ' rejoined Quilp . '
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 7]: I wo n't hear of Cheggs .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 7]: Her name is Swiveller or nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 47]: I 'll drink her health again , and her father 's , and her mother 's ; and to all her sisters and brothers -- the glorious family of the Wackleses -- all the Wackleses in one glass -- down with it to the dregs ! '
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 77]: ` Well , ' said Richard Swiveller , stopping short in the act of raising the glass to his lips and looking at the dwarf in a species of stupor as he flourished his arms and legs about : ` you 're a jolly fellow , but of all the jolly fellows I ever saw or heard of , you have the queerest and most extraordinary way with you , upon my life you have . '
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 66]: This candid declaration tended rather to increase than restrain Mr Quilp 's eccentricities , and Richard Swiveller , astonished to see him in such a roystering vein , and drinking not a little himself , for company -- began imperceptibly to become more companionable and confiding , so that , being judiciously led on by Mr Quilp , he grew at last very confiding indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 56]: Having once got him into this mood , and knowing now the key-note to strike whenever he was at a loss , Daniel Quilp 's task was comparatively an easy one , and he was soon in possession of the whole details of the scheme contrived between the easy Dick and his more designing friend .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 4]: ` Stop ! '
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 3]: said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 11]: ` That 's the thing , that 's the thing .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 12]: It can be brought about , it shall be brought about .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 16]: There 's my hand upon it ; I am your friend from this minute . '
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 10]: do you think there 's still a chance ? '
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 10]: inquired Dick , in surprise at this encouragement . '
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 4]: A chance ! '
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 8]: echoed the dwarf , ' a certainty !
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 17]: Sophy Wackles may become a Cheggs or anything else she likes , but not a Swiveller .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 5]: Oh you lucky dog !
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 14]: He 's richer than any Jew alive ; you 're a made man .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 17]: I see in you now nothing but Nelly 's husband , rolling in gold and silver .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 5]: I 'll help you .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 5]: It shall be done .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 10]: Mind my words , it shall be done . '
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 5]: ` But how ? '
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 19]: ` There 's plenty of time , ' rejoined the dwarf , ` and it shall be done .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 14]: We 'll sit down and talk it over again all the way through .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 8]: Fill your glass while I 'm gone .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 9]: I shall be back directly -- directly . '
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 32]: With these hasty words , Daniel Quilp withdrew into a dismantled skittle-ground behind the public-house , and , throwing himself upon the ground actually screamed and rolled about in uncontrollable delight .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 6]: ` Here 's sport ! '
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 21]: he cried , ` sport ready to my hand , all invented and arranged , and only to be enjoyed .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 18]: It was this shallow-pated fellow who made my bones ache t ` other day , was it ?
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 26]: It was his friend and fellow-plotter , Mr Trent , that once made eyes at Mrs Quilp , and leered and looked , was it ?
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 31]: After labouring for two or three years in their precious scheme , to find that they 've got a beggar at last , and one of them tied for life .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 4]: Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 5]: He shall marry Nell .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 37]: He shall have her , and I 'll be the first man , when the knot 's tied hard and fast , to tell 'em what they 've gained and what I 've helped 'em to .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 33]: Here will be a clearing of old scores , here will be a time to remind 'em what a capital friend I was , and how I helped them to the heiress .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 5]: Ha ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 54]: In the height of his ecstasy , Mr Quilp had like to have met with a disagreeable check , for rolling very near a broken dog-kennel , there leapt forth a large fierce dog , who , but that his chain was of the shortest , would have given him a disagreeable salute .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 44]: As it was , the dwarf remained upon his back in perfect safety , taunting the dog with hideous faces , and triumphing over him in his inability to advance another inch , though there were not a couple of feet between them .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 25]: ` Why do n't you come and bite me , why do n't you come and tear me to pieces , you coward ? '
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 14]: said Quilp , hissing and worrying the animal till he was nearly mad .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 18]: ` You 're afraid , you bully , you 're afraid , you know you are . '
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 31]: The dog tore and strained at his chain with starting eyes and furious bark , but there the dwarf lay , snapping his fingers with gestures of defiance and contempt .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 41]: When he had sufficiently recovered from his delight , he rose , and with his arms a-kimbo , achieved a kind of demon-dance round the kennel , just without the limits of the chain , driving the dog quite wild .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 47]: Having by this means composed his spirits and put himself in a pleasant train , he returned to his unsuspicious companion , whom he found looking at the tide with exceeding gravity , and thinking of that same gold and silver which Mr Quilp had mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 61]: Chapter 22 The remainder of that day and the whole of the next were a busy time for the Nubbles family , to whom everything connected with Kit 's outfit and departure was matter of as great moment as if he had been about to penetrate into the interior of Africa , or to take a cruise round the world .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 76]: It would be difficult to suppose that there ever was a box which was opened and shut so many times within four-and-twenty hours , as that which contained his wardrobe and necessaries ; and certainly there never was one which to two small eyes presented such a mine of clothing , as this mighty chest with its three shirts and proportionate allowance of stockings and pocket-handkerchiefs , disclosed to the astonished vision of little Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 79]: At last it was conveyed to the carrier 's , at whose house at Finchley Kit was to find it next day ; and the box being gone , there remained but two questions for consideration : firstly , whether the carrier would lose , or dishonestly feign to lose , the box upon the road ; secondly , whether Kit 's mother perfectly understood how to take care of herself in the absence of her son . '
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 43]: I do n't think there 's hardly a chance of his really losing it , but carriers are under great temptation to pretend they lose things , no doubt , ' said Mrs Nubbles apprehensively , in reference to the first point .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 35]: ` No doubt about it , ' returned Kit , with a serious look ; ` upon my word , mother , I do n't think it was right to trust it to itself .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 13]: Somebody ought to have gone with it , I 'm afraid . '
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 21]: ` We ca n't help it now , ' said his mother ; ` but it was foolish and wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 8]: People ought n't to be tempted . '
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 35]: Kit inwardly resolved that he would never tempt a carrier any more , save with an empty box ; and having formed this Christian determination , he turned his thoughts to the second question .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 23]: ` YOU know you must keep up your spirits , mother , and not be lonesome because I 'm not at home .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 66]: I shall very often be able to look in when I come into town I dare say , and I shall send you a letter sometimes , and when the quarter comes round , I can get a holiday of course ; and then see if we do n't take little Jacob to the play , and let him know what oysters means . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 24]: I hope plays may n't be sinful , Kit , but I 'm a ` most afraid , ' said Mrs Nubbles . '
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 24]: I know who has been putting that in your head , ' rejoined her son disconsolately ; ` that 's Little Bethel again .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 126]: Now I say , mother , pray do n't take to going there regularly , for if I was to see your good-humoured face that has always made home cheerful , turned into a grievous one , and the baby trained to look grievous too , and to call itself a young sinner -LRB- bless its heart -RRB- and a child of the devil -LRB- which is calling its dead father names -RRB- ; if I was to see this , and see little Jacob looking grievous likewise , I should so take it to heart that I 'm sure I should go and list for a soldier , and run my head on purpose against the first cannon-ball I saw coming my way . '
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 13]: ` Oh , Kit , do n't talk like that . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 43]: I would , indeed , mother , and unless you want to make me feel very wretched and uncomfortable , you 'll keep that bow on your bonnet , which you 'd more than half a mind to pull off last week .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 22]: Can you suppose there 's any harm in looking as cheerful and being as cheerful as our poor circumstances will permit ?
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 44]: Do I see anything in the way I 'm made , which calls upon me to be a snivelling , solemn , whispering chap , sneaking about as if I could n't help it , and expressing myself in a most unpleasant snuffle ?
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 15]: on the contrary , do n't I see every reason why I should n't ?
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 4]: just hear this !
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 4]: Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 17]: A n't that as nat ` ral as walking , and as good for the health ?
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 4]: Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 31]: A n't that as nat ` ral as a sheep 's bleating , or a pig 's grunting , or a horse 's neighing , or a bird 's singing ?
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 4]: Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 7]: Is n't it , mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 52]: There was something contagious in Kit 's laugh , for his mother , who had looked grave before , first subsided into a smile , and then fell to joining in it heartily , which occasioned Kit to say that he knew it was natural , and to laugh the more .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 50]: Kit and his mother , laughing together in a pretty loud key , woke the baby , who , finding that there was something very jovial and agreeable in progress , was no sooner in its mother 's arms than it began to kick and laugh , most vigorously .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 36]: This new illustration of his argument so tickled Kit , that he fell backward in his chair in a state of exhaustion , pointing at the baby and shaking his sides till he rocked again .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 29]: After recovering twice or thrice , and as often relapsing , he wiped his eyes and said grace ; and a very cheerful meal their scanty supper was .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 96]: With more kisses , and hugs , and tears , than many young gentlemen who start upon their travels , and leave well-stocked homes behind them , would deem within the bounds of probability -LRB- if matter so low could be herein set down -RRB- , Kit left the house at an early hour next morning , and set out to walk to Finchley ; feeling a sufficient pride in his appearance to have warranted his excommunication from Little Bethel from that time forth , if he had ever been one of that mournful congregation .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 81]: Lest anybody should feel a curiosity to know how Kit was clad , it may be briefly remarked that he wore no livery , but was dressed in a coat of pepper-and-salt with waistcoat of canary colour , and nether garments of iron-grey ; besides these glories , he shone in the lustre of a new pair of boots and an extremely stiff and shiny hat , which on being struck anywhere with the knuckles , sounded like a drum .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 36]: And in this attire , rather wondering that he attracted so little attention , and attributing the circumstance to the insensibility of those who got up early , he made his way towards Abel Cottage .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 66]: Without encountering any more remarkable adventure on the road , than meeting a lad in a brimless hat , the exact counterpart of his old one , on whom he bestowed half the sixpence he possessed , Kit arrived in course of time at the carrier 's house , where , to the lasting honour of human nature , he found the box in safety .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 28]: Receiving from the wife of this immaculate man , a direction to Mr Garland 's , he took the box upon his shoulder and repaired thither directly .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 38]: To be sure , it was a beautiful little cottage with a thatched roof and little spires at the gable-ends , and pieces of stained glass in some of the windows , almost as large as pocket-books .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 31]: On one side of the house was a little stable , just the size for the pony , with a little room over it , just the size for Kit .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 70]: White curtains were fluttering , and birds in cages that looked as bright as if they were made of gold , were singing at the windows ; plants were arranged on either side of the path , and clustered about the door ; and the garden was bright with flowers in full bloom , which shed a sweet odour all round , and had a charming and elegant appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 17]: Everything within the house and without , seemed to be the perfection of neatness and order .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 50]: In the garden there was not a weed to be seen , and to judge from some dapper gardening-tools , a basket , and a pair of gloves which were lying in one of the walks , old Mr Garland had been at work in it that very morning .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 36]: Kit looked about him , and admired , and looked again , and this a great many times before he could make up his mind to turn his head another way and ring the bell .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 39]: There was abundance of time to look about him again though , when he had rung it , for nobody came , so after ringing it twice or thrice he sat down upon his box , and waited .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 14]: He rang the bell a great many times , and yet nobody came .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 89]: But at last , as he was sitting upon the box thinking about giants ' castles , and princesses tied up to pegs by the hair of their heads , and dragons bursting out from behind gates , and other incidents of the like nature , common in story-books to youths of low degree on their first visit to strange houses , the door was gently opened , and a little servant-girl , very tidy , modest , and demure , but very pretty too , appeared . '
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 13]: I suppose you 're Christopher , sir , ' said the servant-girl .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 13]: Kit got off the box , and said yes , he was .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 34]: ` I 'm afraid you 've rung a good many times perhaps , ' she rejoined , ` but we could n't hear you , because we 've been catching the pony . '
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 76]: Kit rather wondered what this meant , but as he could n't stop there , asking questions , he shouldered the box again and followed the girl into the hall , where through a back-door he descried Mr Garland leading Whisker in triumph up the garden , after that self-willed pony had -LRB- as he afterwards learned -RRB- dodged the family round a small paddock in the rear , for one hour and three quarters .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 40]: The old gentleman received him very kindly and so did the old lady , whose previous good opinion of him was greatly enhanced by his wiping his boots on the mat until the soles of his feet burnt again .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 119]: He was then taken into the parlour to be inspected in his new clothes ; and when he had been surveyed several times , and had afforded by his appearance unlimited satisfaction , he was taken into the stable -LRB- where the pony received him with uncommon complaisance -RRB- ; and thence into the little chamber he had already observed , which was very clean and comfortable : and thence into the garden , in which the old gentleman told him he would be taught to employ himself , and where he told him , besides , what great things he meant to do to make him comfortable , and happy , if he found he deserved it .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 27]: All these kindnesses , Kit acknowledged with various expressions of gratitude , and so many touches of the new hat , that the brim suffered considerably .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 78]: When the old gentleman had said all he had to say in the way of promise and advice , and Kit had said all he had to say in the way of assurance and thankfulness , he was handed over again to the old lady , who , summoning the little servant-girl -LRB- whose name was Barbara -RRB- instructed her to take him down stairs and give him something to eat and drink , after his walk .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 53]: Down stairs , therefore , Kit went ; and at the bottom of the stairs there was such a kitchen as was never before seen or heard of out of a toy-shop window , with everything in it as bright and glowing , and as precisely ordered too , as Barbara herself .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 50]: And in this kitchen , Kit sat himself down at a table as white as a tablecloth , to eat cold meat , and drink small ale , and use his knife and fork the more awkwardly , because there was an unknown Barbara looking on and observing him .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 50]: It did not appear , however , that there was anything remarkably tremendous about this strange Barbara , who having lived a very quiet life , blushed very much and was quite as embarrassed and uncertain what she ought to say or do , as Kit could possibly be .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 68]: When he had sat for some little time , attentive to the ticking of the sober clock , he ventured to glance curiously at the dresser , and there , among the plates and dishes , were Barbara 's little work-box with a sliding lid to shut in the balls of cotton , and Barbara 's prayer-book , and Barbara 's hymn-book , and Barbara 's Bible .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 25]: Barbara 's little looking-glass hung in a good light near the window , and Barbara 's bonnet was on a nail behind the door .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 107]: From all these mute signs and tokens of her presence , he naturally glanced at Barbara herself , who sat as mute as they , shelling peas into a dish ; and just when Kit was looking at her eyelashes and wondering -- quite in the simplicity of his heart -- what colour her eyes might be , it perversely happened that Barbara raised her head a little to look at him , when both pair of eyes were hastily withdrawn , and Kit leant over his plate , and Barbara over her pea-shells , each in extreme confusion at having been detected by the other .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 158]: Chapter 23 Mr Richard Swiveller wending homeward from the Wilderness -LRB- for such was the appropriate name of Quilp 's choice retreat -RRB- , after a sinuous and corkscrew fashion , with many checks and stumbles ; after stopping suddenly and staring about him , then as suddenly running forward for a few paces , and as suddenly halting again and shaking his head ; doing everything with a jerk and nothing by premeditation ; -- Mr Richard Swiveller wending his way homeward after this fashion , which is considered by evil-minded men to be symbolical of intoxication , and is not held by such persons to denote that state of deep wisdom and reflection in which the actor knows himself to be , began to think that possibly he had misplaced his confidence and that the dwarf might not be precisely the sort of person to whom to entrust a secret of such delicacy and importance .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 72]: And being led and tempted on by this remorseful thought into a condition which the evil-minded class before referred to would term the maudlin state or stage of drunkenness , it occurred to Mr Swiveller to cast his hat upon the ground , and moan , crying aloud that he was an unhappy orphan , and that if he had not been an unhappy orphan things had never come to this .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 50]: ` Left an infant by my parents , at an early age , ' said Mr Swiveller , bewailing his hard lot , ` cast upon the world in my tenderest period , and thrown upon the mercies of a deluding dwarf , who can wonder at my weakness !
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 8]: Here 's a miserable orphan for you .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 26]: Here , ' said Mr Swiveller raising his voice to a high pitch , and looking sleepily round , ` is a miserable orphan ! '
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 19]: ` Then , ' said somebody hard by , ` let me be a father to you . '
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 54]: Mr Swiveller swayed himself to and fro to preserve his balance , and , looking into a kind of haze which seemed to surround him , at last perceived two eyes dimly twinkling through the mist , which he observed after a short time were in the neighbourhood of a nose and mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 79]: Casting his eyes down towards that quarter in which , with reference to a man 's face , his legs are usually to be found , he observed that the face had a body attached ; and when he looked more intently he was satisfied that the person was Mr Quilp , who indeed had been in his company all the time , but whom he had some vague idea of having left a mile or two behind .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 16]: ` You have deceived an orphan , Sir , ' said Mr Swiveller solemnly . '
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 3]: ` I !
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 12]: I 'm a second father to you , ' replied Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 8]: ` You my father , Sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 3]: retorted Dick .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 20]: ` Being all right myself , Sir , I request to be left alone -- instantly , Sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 9]: ` What a funny fellow you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 3]: cried Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 18]: ` Go , Sir , ' returned Dick , leaning against a post and waving his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 34]: ` Go , deceiver , go , some day , Sir , p ` r ` aps you 'll waken , from pleasure 's dream to know , the grief of orphans forsaken .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 7]: Will you go , Sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 22]: The dwarf taking no heed of this adjuration , Mr Swiveller advanced with the view of inflicting upon him condign chastisement .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 43]: But forgetting his purpose or changing his mind before he came close to him , he seized his hand and vowed eternal friendship , declaring with an agreeable frankness that from that time forth they were brothers in everything but personal appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 67]: Then he told his secret over again , with the addition of being pathetic on the subject of Miss Wackles , who , he gave Mr Quilp to understand , was the occasion of any slight incoherency he might observe in his speech at that moment , which was attributable solely to the strength of his affection and not to rosy wine or other fermented liquor .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 11]: And then they went on arm-in-arm , very lovingly together .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 29]: ` I 'm as sharp , ' said Quilp to him , at parting , ` as sharp as a ferret , and as cunning as a weazel .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 49]: You bring Trent to me ; assure him that I 'm his friend though i fear he a little distrusts me -LRB- I do n't know why , I have not deserved it -RRB- ; and you 've both of you made your fortunes -- in perspective . '
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 12]: ` That 's the worst of it , ' returned Dick .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 13]: ` These fortunes in perspective look such a long way off . '
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 22]: ` But they look smaller than they really are , on that account , ' said Quilp , pressing his arm .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 19]: ` You 'll have no conception of the value of your prize until you draw close to it .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 4]: Mark that . '
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 7]: 'D ` ye think not ? '
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 24]: ` Aye , I do ; and I am certain of what I say , that 's better , ' returned the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 7]: ` You bring Trent to me .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 16]: Tell him I am his friend and yours -- why should n't I be ? '
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 63]: ` There 's no reason why you should n't , certainly , ' replied Dick , ` and perhaps there are a great many why you should -- at least there would be nothing strange in your wanting to be my friend , if you were a choice spirit , but then you know you 're not a choice spirit . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 7]: I not a choice spirit ? '
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 3]: cried Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 12]: ` Devil a bit , sir , ' returned Dick . '
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 9]: A man of your appearance could n't be .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 16]: If you 're any spirit at all , sir , you 're an evil spirit .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 34]: Choice spirits , ' added Dick , smiting himself on the breast , ` are quite a different looking sort of people , you may take your oath of that , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 38]: Quilp glanced at his free-spoken friend with a mingled expression of cunning and dislike , and wringing his hand almost at the same moment , declared that he was an uncommon character and had his warmest esteem .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 49]: With that they parted ; Mr Swiveller to make the best of his way home and sleep himself sober ; and Quilp to cogitate upon the discovery he had made , and exult in the prospect of the rich field of enjoyment and reprisal it opened to him .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 67]: It was not without great reluctance and misgiving that Mr Swiveller , next morning , his head racked by the fumes of the renowned Schiedam , repaired to the lodging of his friend Trent -LRB- which was in the roof of an old house in an old ghostly inn -RRB- , and recounted by very slow degrees what had yesterday taken place between him and Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 34]: Nor was it without great surprise and much speculation on Quilp 's probable motives , nor without many bitter comments on Dick Swiveller 's folly , that his friend received the tale . '
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 62]: I do n't defend myself , Fred , ' said the penitent Richard ; ` but the fellow has such a queer way with him and is such an artful dog , that first of all he set me upon thinking whether there was any harm in telling him , and while I was thinking , screwed it out of me .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 22]: If you had seen him drink and smoke , as I did , you could n't have kept anything from him .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 14]: He 's a Salamander you know , that 's what he is . '
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 92]: Without inquiring whether Salamanders were of necessity good confidential agents , or whether a fire-proof man was as a matter of course trustworthy , Frederick Trent threw himself into a chair , and , burying his head in his hands , endeavoured to fathom the motives which had led Quilp to insinuate himself into Richard Swiveller 's confidence ; -- for that the disclosure was of his seeking , and had not been spontaneously revealed by Dick , was sufficiently plain from Quilp 's seeking his company and enticing him away .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 17]: The dwarf had twice encountered him when he was endeavouring to obtain intelligence of the fugitives .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 51]: This , perhaps , as he had not shown any previous anxiety about them , was enough to awaken suspicion in the breast of a creature so jealous and distrustful by nature , setting aside any additional impulse to curiosity that he might have derived from Dick 's incautious manner .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 16]: But knowing the scheme they had planned , why should he offer to assist it ?
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 91]: This was a question more difficult of solution ; but as knaves generally overreach themselves by imputing their own designs to others , the idea immediately presented itself that some circumstances of irritation between Quilp and the old man , arising out of their secret transactions and not unconnected perhaps with his sudden disappearance , now rendered the former desirous of revenging himself upon him by seeking to entrap the sole object of his love and anxiety into a connexion of which he knew he had a dread and hatred .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 41]: As Frederick Trent himself , utterly regardless of his sister , had this object at heart , only second to the hope of gain , it seemed to him the more likely to be Quilp 's main principle of action .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 97]: Once investing the dwarf with a design of his own in abetting them , which the attainment of their purpose would serve , it was easy to believe him sincere and hearty in the cause ; and as there could be no doubt of his proving a powerful and useful auxiliary , Trent determined to accept his invitation and go to his house that night , and if what he said and did confirmed him in the impression he had formed , to let him share the labour of their plan , but not the profit .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 61]: Having revolved these things in his mind and arrived at this conclusion , he communicated to Mr Swiveller as much of his meditations as he thought proper -LRB- Dick would have been perfectly satisfied with less -RRB- , and giving him the day to recover himself from his late salamandering , accompanied him at evening to Mr Quilp 's house .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 54]: Mighty glad Mr Quilp was to see them , or mightily glad he seemed to be ; and fearfully polite Mr Quilp was to Mrs Quilp and Mrs jiniwin ; and very sharp was the look he cast on his wife to observe how she was affected by the recognition of young Trent .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 80]: Mrs Quilp was as innocent as her own mother of any emotion , painful or pleasant , which the sight of him awakened , but as her husband 's glance made her timid and confused , and uncertain what to do or what was required of her , Mr Quilp did not fail to assign her embarrassment to the cause he had in his mind , and while he chuckled at his penetration was secretly exasperated by his jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 7]: Nothing of this appeared , however .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 23]: On the contrary , Mr Quilp was all blandness and suavity , and presided over the case-bottle of rum with extraordinary open-heartedness .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 11]: ` Why , let me see , ' said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 17]: ` It must be a matter of nearly two years since we were first acquainted . '
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 11]: ` Nearer three , I think , ' said Trent .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 5]: ` Nearer three ! '
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 3]: cried Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 6]: ` How fast time flies .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 14]: Does it seem as long as that to you , Mrs Quilp ? '
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 19]: ` Yes , I think it seems full three years , Quilp , ' was the unfortunate reply .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 19]: ` Oh indeed , ma'am , ' thought Quilp , ` you have been pining , have you ?
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 6]: Very good , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 29]: ` It seems to me but yesterday that you went out to Demerara in the Mary Anne , ' said Quilp ; ` but yesterday , I declare .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 8]: Well , I like a little wildness .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 7]: I was wild myself once . '
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 71]: Mr Quilp accompanied this admission with such an awful wink , indicative of old rovings and backslidings , that Mrs Jiniwin was indignant , and could not forbear from remarking under her breath that he might at least put off his confessions until his wife was absent ; for which act of boldness and insubordination Mr Quilp first stared her out of countenance and then drank her health ceremoniously . '
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 10]: I thought you 'd come back directly , Fred .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 13]: I always thought that , ' said Quilp setting down his glass .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 47]: ` And when the Mary Anne returned with you on board , instead of a letter to say what a contrite heart you had , and how happy you were in the situation that had been provided for you , I was amused -- exceedingly amused .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 5]: Ha ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 34]: The young man smiled , but not as though the theme was the most agreeable one that could have been selected for his entertainment ; and for that reason Quilp pursued it . '
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 50]: I always will say , ' he resumed , ` that when a rich relation having two young people -- sisters or brothers , or brother and sister -- dependent on him , attaches himself exclusively to one , and casts off the other , he does wrong . '
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 33]: The young man made a movement of impatience , but Quilp went on as calmly as if he were discussing some abstract question in which nobody present had the slightest personal interest .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 41]: ` It 's very true , ' said Quilp , ` that your grandfather urged repeated forgiveness , ingratitude , riot , and extravagance , and all that ; but as I told him `` these are common faults . ''
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 11]: `` But he 's a scoundrel , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 30]: `` Granting that , '' said I -LRB- for the sake of argument of course -RRB- , `` a great many young noblemen and gentlemen are scoundrels too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 9]: But he would n't be convinced . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 15]: I wonder at that , Mr Quilp , ' said the young man sarcastically .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 21]: ` Well , so did I at the time , ' returned Quilp , ` but he was always obstinate .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 18]: He was in a manner a friend of mine , but he was always obstinate and wrong-headed .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 19]: Little Nell is a nice girl , a charming girl , but you 're her brother , Frederick .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 24]: You 're her brother after all ; as you told him the last time you met , he ca n't alter that . '
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 23]: ` He would if he could , confound him for that and all other kindnesses , ' said the young man impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 24]: ` But nothing can come of this subject now , and let us have done with it in the Devil 's name . '
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 14]: ` Agreed , ' returned Quilp , ` agreed on my part readily .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 7]: Why have I alluded to it ?
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 15]: Just to show you , Frederick , that I have always stood your friend .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 17]: You little knew who was your friend , and who your foe ; now did you ?
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 30]: You thought I was against you , and so there has been a coolness between us ; but it was all on your side , entirely on your side .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 9]: Let 's shake hands again , Fred . '
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 30]: With his head sunk down between his shoulders , and a hideous grin over-spreading his face , the dwarf stood up and stretched his short arm across the table .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 57]: After a moment 's hesitation , the young man stretched out his to meet it ; Quilp clutched his fingers in a grip that for the moment stopped the current of the blood within them , and pressing his other hand upon his lip and frowning towards the unsuspicious Richard , released them and sat down .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 55]: This action was not lost upon Trent , who , knowing that Richard Swiveller was a mere tool in his hands and knew no more of his designs than he thought proper to communicate , saw that the dwarf perfectly understood their relative position , and fully entered into the character of his friend .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 11]: It is something to be appreciated , even in knavery .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 46]: This silent homage to his superior abilities , no less than a sense of the power with which the dwarf 's quick perception had already invested him , inclined the young man towards that ugly worthy , and determined him to profit by his aid .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 62]: It being now Mr Quilp 's cue to change the subject with all convenient expedition , lest Richard Swiveller in his heedlessness should reveal anything which it was inexpedient for the women to know , he proposed a game at four-handed cribbage , and partners being cut for , Mrs Quilp fell to Frederick Trent , and Dick himself to Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 90]: Mrs Jiniwin being very fond of cards was carefully excluded by her son-in-law from any participation in the game , and had assigned to her the duty of occasionally replenishing the glasses from the case-bottle ; Mr Quilp from that moment keeping one eye constantly upon her , lest she should by any means procure a taste of the same , and thereby tantalising the wretched old lady -LRB- who was as much attached to the case-bottle as the cards -RRB- in a double degree and most ingenious manner .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 25]: But it was not to Mrs Jiniwin alone that Mr Quilp 's attention was restricted , as several other matters required his constant vigilance .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 100]: Among his various eccentric habits he had a humorous one of always cheating at cards , which rendered necessary on his part , not only a close observance of the game , and a sleight-of-hand in counting and scoring , but also involved the constant correction , by looks , and frowns , and kicks under the table , of Richard Swiveller , who being bewildered by the rapidity with which his cards were told , and the rate at which the pegs travelled down the board , could not be prevented from sometimes expressing his surprise and incredulity .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 110]: Mrs Quilp too was the partner of young Trent , and for every look that passed between them , and every word they spoke , and every card they played , the dwarf had eyes and ears ; not occupied alone with what was passing above the table , but with signals that might be exchanging beneath it , which he laid all kinds of traps to detect ; besides often treading on his wife 's toes to see whether she cried out or remained silent under the infliction , in which latter case it would have been quite clear that Trent had been treading on her toes before .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 81]: Yet , in the most of all these distractions , the one eye was upon the old lady always , and if she so much as stealthily advanced a tea-spoon towards a neighbouring glass -LRB- which she often did -RRB- , for the purpose of abstracting but one sup of its sweet contents , Quilp 's hand would overset it in the very moment of her triumph , and Quilp 's mocking voice implore her to regard her precious health .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 21]: And in any one of these his many cares , from first to last , Quilp never flagged nor faltered .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 48]: At length , when they had played a great many rubbers and drawn pretty freely upon the case-bottle , Mr Quilp warned his lady to retire to rest , and that submissive wife complying , and being followed by her indignant mother , Mr Swiveller fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 23]: The dwarf beckoning his remaining companion to the other end of the room , held a short conference with him in whispers .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 30]: ` It 's as well not to say more than one can help before our worthy friend , ' said Quilp , making a grimace towards the slumbering Dick .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 10]: ` Is it a bargain between us , Fred ?
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 9]: Shall he marry little rosy Nell by-and-by ? '
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 19]: ` You have some end of your own to answer , of course , ' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 26]: ` Of course I have , dear Fred , ' said Quilp , grinning to think how little he suspected what the real end was .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 9]: ` It 's retaliation perhaps ; perhaps whim .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 11]: I have influence , Fred , to help or oppose .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 7]: Which way shall I use it ?
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 14]: There are a pair of scales , and it goes into one . '
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 11]: ` Throw it into mine then , ' said Trent .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 29]: ` It 's done , Fred , ' rejoined Quilp , stretching out his clenched hand and opening it as if he had let some weight fall out .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 16]: ` It 's in the scale from this time , and turns it , Fred .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 4]: Mind that . '
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 7]: ` Where have they gone ? '
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 3]: asked Trent .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 21]: Quilp shook his head , and said that point remained to be discovered , which it might be , easily .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 11]: When it was , they would begin their preliminary advances .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 47]: He would visit the old man , or even Richard Swiveller might visit him , and by affecting a deep concern in his behalf , and imploring him to settle in some worthy home , lead to the child 's remembering him with gratitude and favour .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 61]: Once impressed to this extent , it would be easy , he said , to win her in a year or two , for she supposed the old man to be poor , as it was a part of his jealous policy -LRB- in common with many other misers -RRB- to feign to be so , to those about him .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 17]: ` He has feigned it often enough to me , of late , ' said Trent .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 6]: and to me too ! '
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 4]: replied the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 17]: ` Which is more extraordinary , as I know how rich he really is . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 10]: I suppose you should , ' said Trent . '
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 23]: I think I should indeed , ' rejoined the dwarf ; and in that , at least , he spoke the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 29]: After a few more whispered words , they returned to the table , and the young man rousing Richard Swiveller informed him that he was waiting to depart .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 12]: This was welcome news to Dick , who started up directly .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 24]: After a few words of confidence in the result of their project had been exchanged , they bade the grinning Quilp good night .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 16]: Quilp crept to the window as they passed in the street below , and listened .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 30]: Trent was pronouncing an encomium upon his wife , and they were both wondering by what enchantment she had been brought to marry such a misshapen wretch as he .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 26]: The dwarf after watching their retreating shadows with a wider grin than his face had yet displayed , stole softly in the dark to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 25]: In this hatching of their scheme , neither Trent nor Quilp had had one thought about the happiness or misery of poor innocent Nell .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 110]: It would have been strange if the careless profligate , who was the butt of both , had been harassed by any such consideration ; for his high opinion of his own merits and deserts rendered the project rather a laudable one than otherwise ; and if he had been visited by so unwonted a guest as reflection , he would -- being a brute only in the gratification of his appetites -- have soothed his conscience with the plea that he did not mean to beat or kill his wife , and would therefore , after all said and done , be a very tolerable , average husband .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 50]: Chapter 24 It was not until they were quite exhausted and could no longer maintain the pace at which they had fled from the race-ground , that the old man and the child ventured to stop , and sit down to rest upon the borders of a little wood .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 33]: Here , though the course was hidden from their view , they could yet faintly distinguish the noise of distant shouts , the hum of voices , and the beating of drums .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 44]: Climbing the eminence which lay between them and the spot they had left , the child could even discern the fluttering flags and white tops of booths ; but no person was approaching towards them , and their resting-place was solitary and still .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 21]: Some time elapsed before she could reassure her trembling companion , or restore him to a state of moderate tranquillity .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 35]: His disordered imagination represented to him a crowd of persons stealing towards them beneath the cover of the bushes , lurking in every ditch , and peeping from the boughs of every rustling tree .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 45]: He was haunted by apprehensions of being led captive to some gloomy place where he would be chained and scourged , and worse than all , where Nell could never come to see him , save through iron bars and gratings in the wall .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 6]: His terrors affected the child .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 51]: Separation from her grandfather was the greatest evil she could dread ; and feeling for the time as though , go where they would , they were to be hunted down , and could never be safe but in hiding , her heart failed her , and her courage drooped .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 27]: In one so young , and so unused to the scenes in which she had lately moved , this sinking of the spirit was not surprising .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 71]: But , Nature often enshrines gallant and noble hearts in weak bosoms -- oftenest , God bless her , in female breasts -- and when the child , casting her tearful eyes upon the old man , remembered how weak he was , and how destitute and helpless he would be if she failed him , her heart swelled within her , and animated her with new strength and fortitude .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 21]: ` We are quite safe now , and have nothing to fear indeed , dear grandfather , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 6]: ` Nothing to fear ! '
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 5]: returned the old man .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 11]: ` Nothing to fear if they took me from thee !
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 8]: Nothing to fear if they parted us !
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 6]: Nobody is true to me .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 5]: No , not one .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 5]: Not even Nell ! '
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 26]: do not say that , ' replied the child , ` for if ever anybody was true at heart , and earnest , I am .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 9]: I am sure you know I am . '
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 51]: ` Then how , ' said the old man , looking fearfully round , ` how can you bear to think that we are safe , when they are searching for me everywhere , and may come here , and steal upon us , even while we 're talking ? '
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 16]: ` Because I 'm sure we have not been followed , ' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 20]: ` Judge for yourself , dear grandfather : look round , and see how quiet and still it is .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 12]: We are alone together , and may ramble where we like .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 3]: Not safe !
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 18]: Could I feel easy -- did I feel at ease -- when any danger threatened you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 19]: ` True , too , ' he answered , pressing her hand , but still looking anxiously about .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 8]: ` What noise was that ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 24]: A bird , ' said the child , ` flying into the wood , and leading the way for us to follow . '
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 31]: You remember that we said we would walk in woods and fields , and by the side of rivers , and how happy we would be -- you remember that ?
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 28]: But here , while the sun shines above our heads , and everything is bright and happy , we are sitting sadly down , and losing time .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 28]: See what a pleasant path ; and there 's the bird -- the same bird -- now he flies to another tree , and stays to sing .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 3]: Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 132]: When they rose up from the ground , and took the shady track which led them through the wood , she bounded on before , printing her tiny footsteps in the moss , which rose elastic from so light a pressure and gave it back as mirrors throw off breath ; and thus she lured the old man on , with many a backward look and merry beck , now pointing stealthily to some lone bird as it perched and twittered on a branch that strayed across their path , now stopping to listen to the songs that broke the happy silence , or watch the sun as it trembled through the leaves , and stealing in among the ivied trunks of stout old trees , opened long paths of light .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 78]: As they passed onward , parting the boughs that clustered in their way , the serenity which the child had first assumed , stole into her breast in earnest ; the old man cast no longer fearful looks behind , but felt at ease and cheerful , for the further they passed into the deep green shade , the more they felt that the tranquil mind of God was there , and shed its peace on them .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 25]: At length the path becoming clearer and less intricate , brought them to the end of the wood , and into a public road .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 36]: Taking their way along it for a short distance , they came to a lane , so shaded by the trees on either hand that they met together over-head , and arched the narrow way .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 23]: A broken finger-post announced that this led to a village three miles off ; and thither they resolved to bend their steps .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 16]: The miles appeared so long that they sometimes thought they must have missed their road .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 40]: But at last , to their great joy , it led downwards in a steep descent , with overhanging banks over which the footpaths led ; and the clustered houses of the village peeped from the woody hollow below .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 7]: It was a very small place .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 35]: The men and boys were playing at cricket on the green ; and as the other folks were looking on , they wandered up and down , uncertain where to seek a humble lodging .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 46]: There was but one old man in the little garden before his cottage , and him they were timid of approaching , for he was the schoolmaster , and had ` School ' written up over his window in black letters on a white board .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 35]: He was a pale , simple-looking man , of a spare and meagre habit , and sat among his flowers and beehives , smoking his pipe , in the little porch before his door .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 14]: ` Speak to him , dear , ' the old man whispered . '
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 14]: I am almost afraid to disturb him , ' said the child timidly .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 9]: ` He does not seem to see us .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 14]: Perhaps if we wait a little , he may look this way . '
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 25]: They waited , but the schoolmaster cast no look towards them , and still sat , thoughtful and silent , in the little porch .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 6]: He had a kind face .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 14]: In his plain old suit of black , he looked pale and meagre .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 42]: They fancied , too , a lonely air about him and his house , but perhaps that was because the other people formed a merry company upon the green , and he seemed the only solitary man in all the place .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 36]: They were very tired , and the child would have been bold enough to address even a schoolmaster , but for something in his manner which seemed to denote that he was uneasy or distressed .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 69]: As they stood hesitating at a little distance , they saw that he sat for a few minutes at a time like one in a brown study , then laid aside his pipe and took a few turns in his garden , then approached the gate and looked towards the green , then took up his pipe again with a sigh , and sat down thoughtfully as before .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 39]: As nobody else appeared and it would soon be dark , Nell at length took courage , and when he had resumed his pipe and seat , ventured to draw near , leading her grandfather by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 17]: The slight noise they made in raising the latch of the wicket-gate , caught his attention .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 16]: He looked at them kindly but seemed disappointed too , and slightly shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 33]: Nell dropped a curtsey , and told him they were poor travellers who sought a shelter for the night which they would gladly pay for , so far as their means allowed .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 20]: The schoolmaster looked earnestly at her as she spoke , laid aside his pipe , and rose up directly .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 24]: ` If you could direct us anywhere , sir , ' said the child , ` we should take it very kindly . '
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 15]: ` You have been walking a long way , ' said the schoolmaster . '
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 11]: A long way , Sir , ' the child replied .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 22]: ` You 're a young traveller , my child , ' he said , laying his hand gently on her head .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 7]: ` Your grandchild , friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 22]: ` Aye , Sir , ' cried the old man , ` and the stay and comfort of my life . '
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 9]: ` Come in , ' said the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 33]: Without further preface he conducted them into his little school-room , which was parlour and kitchen likewise , and told them that they were welcome to remain under his roof till morning .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 43]: Before they had done thanking him , he spread a coarse white cloth upon the table , with knives and platters ; and bringing out some bread and cold meat and a jug of beer , besought them to eat and drink .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 12]: The child looked round the room as she took her seat .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 72]: There were a couple of forms , notched and cut and inked all over ; a small deal desk perched on four legs , at which no doubt the master sat ; a few dog 's - eared books upon a high shelf ; and beside them a motley collection of peg-tops , balls , kites , fishing-lines , marbles , half-eaten apples , and other confiscated property of idle urchins .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 48]: Displayed on hooks upon the wall in all their terrors , were the cane and ruler ; and near them , on a small shelf of its own , the dunce 's cap , made of old newspapers and decorated with glaring wafers of the largest size .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 75]: But , the great ornaments of the walls were certain moral sentences fairly copied in good round text , and well-worked sums in simple addition and multiplication , evidently achieved by the same hand , which were plentifully pasted all round the room : for the double purpose , as it seemed , of bearing testimony to the excellence of the school , and kindling a worthy emulation in the bosoms of the scholars .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 20]: ` Yes , ' said the old schoolmaster , observing that her attention was caught by these latter specimens .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 10]: ` That 's beautiful writing , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 17]: ` Very , Sir , ' replied the child modestly , ` is it yours ? '
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 4]: ` Mine ! '
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 27]: he returned , taking out his spectacles and putting them on , to have a better view of the triumphs so dear to his heart . '
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 9]: I could n't write like that , now-a-days .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 27]: They 're all done by one hand ; a little hand it is , not so old as yours , but a very clever one . '
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 44]: As the schoolmaster said this , he saw that a small blot of ink had been thrown on one of the copies , so he took a penknife from his pocket , and going up to the wall , carefully scraped it out .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 48]: When he had finished , he walked slowly backward from the writing , admiring it as one might contemplate a beautiful picture , but with something of sadness in his voice and manner which quite touched the child , though she was unacquainted with its cause . '
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 11]: A little hand indeed , ' said the poor schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 27]: ` Far beyond all his companions , in his learning and his sports too , how did he ever come to be so fond of me !
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 40]: That I should love him is no wonder , but that he should love me -- ' and there the schoolmaster stopped , and took off his spectacles to wipe them , as though they had grown dim . '
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 15]: I hope there is nothing the matter , sir , ' said Nell anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 13]: ` Not much , my dear , ' returned the schoolmaster . '
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 11]: I hoped to have seen him on the green to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 7]: He was always foremost among them .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 8]: But he 'll be there to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 7]: ` Has he been ill ? '
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 11]: asked the child , with a child 's quick sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 4]: ` Not very .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 21]: They said he was wandering in his head yesterday , dear boy , and so they said the day before .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 26]: But that 's a part of that kind of disorder ; it 's not a bad sign -- not at all a bad sign . '
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 5]: The child was silent .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 11]: He walked to the door , and looked wistfully out .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 12]: The shadows of night were gathering , and all was still .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 28]: ` If he could lean upon anybody 's arm , he would come to me , I know , ' he said , returning into the room .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 12]: ` He always came into the garden to say good night .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 35]: But perhaps his illness has only just taken a favourable turn , and it 's too late for him to come out , for it 's very damp and there 's a heavy dew .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 11]: it 's much better he should n't come to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 15]: The schoolmaster lighted a candle , fastened the window-shutter , and closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 38]: But after he had done this , and sat silent a little time , he took down his hat , and said he would go and satisfy himself , if Nell would sit up till he returned .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 10]: The child readily complied , and he went out .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 53]: She sat there half-an-hour or more , feeling the place very strange and lonely , for she had prevailed upon the old man to go to bed , and there was nothing to be heard but the ticking of an old clock , and the whistling of the wind among the trees .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 21]: When he returned , he took his seat in the chimney corner , but remained silent for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 25]: At length he turned to her , and speaking very gently , hoped she would say a prayer that night for a sick child .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 6]: ` My favourite scholar ! '
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 22]: said the poor schoolmaster , smoking a pipe he had forgotten to light , and looking mournfully round upon the walls .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 18]: ` It is a little hand to have done all that , and waste away with sickness .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 10]: It is a very , very little hand ! '
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 65]: Chapter 25 After a sound night 's rest in a chamber in the thatched roof , in which it seemed the sexton had for some years been a lodger , but which he had lately deserted for a wife and a cottage of his own , the child rose early in the morning and descended to the room where she had supped last night .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 34]: As the schoolmaster had already left his bed and gone out , she bestirred herself to make it neat and comfortable , and had just finished its arrangement when the kind host returned .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 33]: He thanked her many times , and said that the old dame who usually did such offices for him had gone to nurse the little scholar whom he had told her of .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 13]: The child asked how he was , and hoped he was better .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 16]: ` No , ' rejoined the schoolmaster shaking his head sorrowfully , ` no better .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 9]: They even say he is worse . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 14]: I am very sorry for that , Sir , ' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 63]: The poor schoolmaster appeared to be gratified by her earnest manner , but yet rendered more uneasy by it , for he added hastily that anxious people often magnified an evil and thought it greater than it was ; ` for my part , ' he said , in his quiet , patient way , ' I hope it 's not so .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 10]: I do n't think he can be worse . '
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 24]: The child asked his leave to prepare breakfast , and her grandfather coming down stairs , they all three partook of it together .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 26]: While the meal was in progress , their host remarked that the old man seemed much fatigued , and evidently stood in need of rest .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 37]: ` If the journey you have before you is a long one , ' he said , ` and do n't press you for one day , you 're very welcome to pass another night here .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 12]: I should really be glad if you would , friend . '
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 38]: He saw that the old man looked at Nell , uncertain whether to accept or decline his offer ; and added , ' I shall be glad to have your young companion with me for one day .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 22]: If you can do a charity to a lone man , and rest yourself at the same time , do so .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 28]: If you must proceed upon your journey , I wish you well through it , and will walk a little way with you before school begins . '
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 10]: ` What are we to do , Nell ? '
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 17]: said the old man irresolutely , ` say what we 're to do , dear . '
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 21]: It required no great persuasion to induce the child to answer that they had better accept the invitation and remain .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 30]: She was happy to show her gratitude to the kind schoolmaster by busying herself in the performance of such household duties as his little cottage stood in need of .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 46]: When these were done , she took some needle-work from her basket , and sat herself down upon a stool beside the lattice , where the honeysuckle and woodbine entwined their tender stems , and stealing into the room filled it with their delicious breath .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 31]: Her grandfather was basking in the sun outside , breathing the perfume of the flowers , and idly watching the clouds as they floated on before the light summer wind .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 47]: As the schoolmaster , after arranging the two forms in due order , took his seat behind his desk and made other preparations for school , the child was apprehensive that she might be in the way , and offered to withdraw to her little bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 26]: But this he would not allow , and as he seemed pleased to have her there , she remained , busying herself with her work .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 9]: ` Have you many scholars , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 17]: The poor schoolmaster shook his head , and said that they barely filled the two forms .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 9]: ` Are the others clever , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 12]: asked the child , glancing at the trophies on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 26]: ` Good boys , ' returned the schoolmaster , ` good boys enough , my dear , but they 'll never do like that . '
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 38]: A small white-headed boy with a sunburnt face appeared at the door while he was speaking , and stopping there to make a rustic bow , came in and took his seat upon one of the forms .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 60]: The white-headed boy then put an open book , astonishingly dog 's - eared upon his knees , and thrusting his hands into his pockets began counting the marbles with which they were filled ; displaying in the expression of his face a remarkable capacity of totally abstracting his mind from the spelling on which his eyes were fixed .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 111]: Soon afterwards another white-headed little boy came straggling in , and after him a red-headed lad , and after him two more with white heads , and then one with a flaxen poll , and so on until the forms were occupied by a dozen boys or thereabouts , with heads of every colour but grey , and ranging in their ages from four years old to fourteen years or more ; for the legs of the youngest were a long way from the floor when he sat upon the form , and the eldest was a heavy good-tempered foolish fellow , about half a head taller than the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 56]: At the top of the first form -- the post of honour in the school -- was the vacant place of the little sick scholar , and at the head of the row of pegs on which those who came in hats or caps were wont to hang them up , one was left empty .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 34]: No boy attempted to violate the sanctity of seat or peg , but many a one looked from the empty spaces to the schoolmaster , and whispered his idle neighbour behind his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 70]: Then began the hum of conning over lessons and getting them by heart , the whispered jest and stealthy game , and all the noise and drawl of school ; and in the midst of the din sat the poor schoolmaster , the very image of meekness and simplicity , vainly attempting to fix his mind upon the duties of the day , and to forget his little friend .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 28]: But the tedium of his office reminded him more strongly of the willing scholar , and his thoughts were rambling from his pupils -- it was plain .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 61]: None knew this better than the idlest boys , who , growing bolder with impunity , waxed louder and more daring ; playing odd-or-even under the master 's eye , eating apples openly and without rebuke , pinching each other in sport or malice without the least reserve , and cutting their autographs in the very legs of his desk .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 80]: The puzzled dunce , who stood beside it to say his lesson out of book , looked no longer at the ceiling for forgotten words , but drew closer to the master 's elbow and boldly cast his eye upon the page ; the wag of the little troop squinted and made grimaces -LRB- at the smallest boy of course -RRB- , holding no book before his face , and his approving audience knew no constraint in their delight .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 57]: If the master did chance to rouse himself and seem alive to what was going on , the noise subsided for a moment and no eyes met his but wore a studious and a deeply humble look ; but the instant he relapsed again , it broke out afresh , and ten times louder than before .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 47]: how some of those idle fellows longed to be outside , and how they looked at the open door and window , as if they half meditated rushing violently out , plunging into the woods , and being wild boys and savages from that time forth .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 82]: What rebellious thoughts of the cool river , and some shady bathing-place beneath willow trees with branches dipping in the water , kept tempting and urging that sturdy boy , who , with his shirt-collar unbuttoned and flung back as far as it could go , sat fanning his flushed face with a spelling-book , wishing himself a whale , or a tittlebat , or a fly , or anything but a boy at school on that hot , broiling day !
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 2]: Heat !
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 93]: ask that other boy , whose seat being nearest to the door gave him opportunities of gliding out into the garden and driving his companions to madness by dipping his face into the bucket of the well and then rolling on the grass -- ask him if there were ever such a day as that , when even the bees were diving deep down into the cups of flowers and stopping there , as if they had made up their minds to retire from business and be manufacturers of honey no more .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 60]: The day was made for laziness , and lying on one 's back in green places , and staring at the sky till its brightness forced one to shut one 's eyes and go to sleep ; and was this a time to be poring over musty books in a dark room , slighted by the very sun itself ?
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 2]: Monstrous !
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 27]: Nell sat by the window occupied with her work , but attentive still to all that passed , though sometimes rather timid of the boisterous boys .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 40]: The lessons over , writing time began ; and there being but one desk and that the master 's , each boy sat at it in turn and laboured at his crooked copy , while the master walked about .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 58]: This was a quieter time ; for he would come and look over the writer 's shoulder , and tell him mildly to observe how such a letter was turned in such a copy on the wall , praise such an up-stroke here and such a down-stroke there , and bid him take it for his model .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 83]: Then he would stop and tell them what the sick child had said last night , and how he had longed to be among them once again ; and such was the poor schoolmaster 's gentle and affectionate manner , that the boys seemed quite remorseful that they had worried him so much , and were absolutely quiet ; eating no apples , cutting no names , inflicting no pinches , and making no grimaces , for full two minutes afterwards . '
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 27]: I think , boys , ' said the schoolmaster when the clock struck twelve , ` that I shall give an extra half-holiday this afternoon . '
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 39]: At this intelligence , the boys , led on and headed by the tall boy , raised a great shout , in the midst of which the master was seen to speak , but could not be heard .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 41]: As he held up his hand , however , in token of his wish that they should be silent , they were considerate enough to leave off , as soon as the longest-winded among them were quite out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 45]: ` You must promise me first , ' said the schoolmaster , ` that you 'll not be noisy , or at least , if you are , that you 'll go away and be so -- away out of the village I mean .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 14]: I 'm sure you would n't disturb your old playmate and companion . '
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 51]: There was a general murmur -LRB- and perhaps a very sincere one , for they were but boys -RRB- in the negative ; and the tall boy , perhaps as sincerely as any of them , called those about him to witness that he had only shouted in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 34]: ` Then pray do n't forget , there 's my dear scholars , ' said the schoolmaster , ` what I have asked you , and do it as a favour to me .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 19]: Be as happy as you can , and do n't be unmindful that you are blessed with health .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 4]: Good-bye all ! '
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 37]: ` Thank ` ee , Sir , ' and ` good-bye , Sir , ' were said a good many times in a variety of voices , and the boys went out very slowly and softly .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 98]: But there was the sun shining and there were the birds singing , as the sun only shines and the birds only sing on holidays and half-holidays ; there were the trees waving to all free boys to climb and nestle among their leafy branches ; the hay , entreating them to come and scatter it to the pure air ; the green corn , gently beckoning towards wood and stream ; the smooth ground , rendered smoother still by blending lights and shadows , inviting to runs and leaps , and long walks God knows whither .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 32]: It was more than boy could bear , and with a joyous whoop the whole cluster took to their heels and spread themselves about , shouting and laughing as they went .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 9]: ` It 's natural , thank Heaven ! '
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 9]: said the poor schoolmaster , looking after them .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 12]: ` I 'm very glad they did n't mind me ! '
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 53]: It is difficult , however , to please everybody , as most of us would have discovered , even without the fable which bears that moral , and in the course of the afternoon several mothers and aunts of pupils looked in to express their entire disapproval of the schoolmaster 's proceeding .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 241]: A few confined themselves to hints , such as politely inquiring what red-letter day or saint 's day the almanack said it was ; a few -LRB- these were the profound village politicians -RRB- argued that it was a slight to the throne and an affront to church and state , and savoured of revolutionary principles , to grant a half-holiday upon any lighter occasion than the birthday of the Monarch ; but the majority expressed their displeasure on private grounds and in plain terms , arguing that to put the pupils on this short allowance of learning was nothing but an act of downright robbery and fraud : and one old lady , finding that she could not inflame or irritate the peaceable schoolmaster by talking to him , bounced out of his house and talked at him for half-an-hour outside his own window , to another old lady , saying that of course he would deduct this half-holiday from his weekly charge , or of course he would naturally expect to have an opposition started against him ; there was no want of idle chaps in that neighbourhood -LRB- here the old lady raised her voice -RRB- , and some chaps who were too idle even to be schoolmasters , might soon find that there were other chaps put over their heads , and so she would have them take care , and look pretty sharp about them .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 37]: But all these taunts and vexations failed to elicit one word from the meek schoolmaster , who sat with the child by his side -- a little more dejected perhaps , but quite silent and uncomplaining .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 43]: Towards night an old woman came tottering up the garden as speedily as she could , and meeting the schoolmaster at the door , said he was to go to Dame West 's directly , and had best run on before her .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 36]: He and the child were on the point of going out together for a walk , and without relinquishing her hand , the schoolmaster hurried away , leaving the messenger to follow as she might .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 17]: They stopped at a cottage-door , and the schoolmaster knocked softly at it with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 8]: It was opened without loss of time .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 38]: They entered a room where a little group of women were gathered about one , older than the rest , who was crying very bitterly , and sat wringing her hands and rocking herself to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 6]: ` Oh , dame ! '
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 18]: said the schoolmaster , drawing near her chair , ` is it so bad as this ? '
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 18]: ` He 's going fast , ' cried the old woman ; ` my grandson 's dying .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 7]: It 's all along of you .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 16]: You should n't see him now , but for his being so earnest on it .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 10]: This is what his learning has brought him to .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 13]: Oh dear , dear , dear , what can I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 18]: ` Do not say that I am in any fault , ' urged the gentle school-master . '
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 7]: I am not hurt , dame .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 4]: No , no .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 16]: You are in great distress of mind , and do n't mean what you say .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 9]: I am sure you do n't . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 10]: I do , ' returned the old woman . '
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 5]: I mean it all .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 30]: If he had n't been poring over his books out of fear of you , he would have been well and merry now , I know he would . '
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 52]: The schoolmaster looked round upon the other women as if to entreat some one among them to say a kind word for him , but they shook their heads , and murmured to each other that they never thought there was much good in learning , and that this convinced them .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 49]: Without saying a word in reply , or giving them a look of reproach , he followed the old woman who had summoned him -LRB- and who had now rejoined them -RRB- into another room , where his infant friend , half-dressed , lay stretched upon a bed .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 12]: He was a very young boy ; quite a little child .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 27]: His hair still hung in curls about his face , and his eyes were very bright ; but their light was of Heaven , not earth .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 18]: The schoolmaster took a seat beside him , and stooping over the pillow , whispered his name .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 32]: The boy sprung up , stroked his face with his hand , and threw his wasted arms round his neck , crying out that he was his dear kind friend . '
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 6]: I hope I always was .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 14]: I meant to be , God knows , ' said the poor schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 6]: ` Who is that ? '
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 8]: said the boy , seeing Nell . '
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 14]: I am afraid to kiss her , lest I should make her ill .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 9]: Ask her to shake hands with me . '
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 16]: The sobbing child came closer up , and took the little languid hand in hers .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 15]: Releasing his again after a time , the sick boy laid him gently down .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 40]: ` You remember the garden , Harry , ' whispered the schoolmaster , anxious to rouse him , for a dulness seemed gathering upon the child , ` and how pleasant it used to be in the evening time ?
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 29]: You must make haste to visit it again , for I think the very flowers have missed you , and are less gay than they used to be .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 17]: You will come soon , my dear , very soon now -- wo n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 22]: The boy smiled faintly -- so very , very faintly -- and put his hand upon his friend 's grey head .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 19]: He moved his lips too , but no voice came from them ; no , not a sound .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 23]: In the silence that ensued , the hum of distant voices borne upon the evening air came floating through the open window .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 6]: ` What 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 9]: said the sick child , opening his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 10]: ` The boys at play upon the green . '
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 17]: He took a handkerchief from his pillow , and tried to wave it above his head .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 8]: But the feeble arm dropped powerless down .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 7]: ` Shall I do it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 4]: said the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 14]: ` Please wave it at the window , ' was the faint reply .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 7]: ` Tie it to the lattice .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 8]: Some of them may see it there .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 13]: Perhaps they 'll think of me , and look this way . '
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 33]: He raised his head , and glanced from the fluttering signal to his idle bat , that lay with slate and book and other boyish property upon a table in the room .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 26]: And then he laid him softly down once more , and asked if the little girl were there , for he could not see her .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 15]: She stepped forward , and pressed the passive hand that lay upon the coverlet .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 43]: The two old friends and companions -- for such they were , though they were man and child -- held each other in a long embrace , and then the little scholar turned his face towards the wall , and fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 21]: The poor schoolmaster sat in the same place , holding the small cold hand in his , and chafing it .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 10]: It was but the hand of a dead child .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 18]: He felt that ; and yet he chafed it still , and could not lay it down .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 19]: Chapter 26 Almost broken-hearted , Nell withdrew with the schoolmaster from the bedside and returned to his cottage .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 43]: In the midst of her grief and tears she was yet careful to conceal their real cause from the old man , for the dead boy had been a grandchild , and left but one aged relative to mourn his premature decay .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 30]: She stole away to bed as quickly as she could , and when she was alone , gave free vent to the sorrow with which her breast was overcharged .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 79]: But the sad scene she had witnessed , was not without its lesson of content and gratitude ; of content with the lot which left her health and freedom ; and gratitude that she was spared to the one relative and friend she loved , and to live and move in a beautiful world , when so many young creatures -- as young and full of hope as she -- were stricken down and gathered to their graves .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 23]: How many of the mounds in that old churchyard where she had lately strayed , grew green above the graves of children !
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 99]: And though she thought as a child herself , and did not perhaps sufficiently consider to what a bright and happy existence those who die young are borne , and how in death they lose the pain of seeing others die around them , bearing to the tomb some strong affection of their hearts -LRB- which makes the old die many times in one long life -RRB- , still she thought wisely enough , to draw a plain and easy moral from what she had seen that night , and to store it , deep in her mind .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 23]: Her dreams were of the little scholar : not coffined and covered up , but mingling with angels , and smiling happily .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 31]: The sun darting his cheerful rays into the room , awoke her ; and now there remained but to take leave of the poor schoolmaster and wander forth once more .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 13]: By the time they were ready to depart , school had begun .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 33]: In the darkened room , the din of yesterday was going on again : a little sobered and softened down , perhaps , but only a very little , if at all .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 14]: The schoolmaster rose from his desk and walked with them to the gate .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 51]: It was with a trembling and reluctant hand , that the child held out to him the money which the lady had given her at the races for her flowers : faltering in her thanks as she thought how small the sum was , and blushing as she offered it .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 21]: But he bade her put it up , and stooping to kiss her cheek , turned back into his house .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 31]: They had not gone half-a-dozen paces when he was at the door again ; the old man retraced his steps to shake hands , and the child did the same .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 10]: ` Good fortune and happiness go with you ! '
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 6]: said the poor schoolmaster . '
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 8]: I am quite a solitary man now .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 17]: If you ever pass this way again , you 'll not forget the little village-school . '
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 30]: ` We shall never forget it , sir , ' rejoined Nell ; ` nor ever forget to be grateful to you for your kindness to us . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 33]: I have heard such words from the lips of children very often , ' said the schoolmaster , shaking his head , and smiling thoughtfully , ` but they were soon forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 26]: I had attached one young friend to me , the better friend for being young -- but that 's over -- God bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 27]: They bade him farewell very many times , and turned away , walking slowly and often looking back , until they could see him no more .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 21]: At length they had left the village far behind , and even lost sight of the smoke among the trees .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 25]: They trudged onward now , at a quicker pace , resolving to keep the main road , and go wherever it might lead them .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 10]: But main roads stretch a long , long way .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 71]: With the exception of two or three inconsiderable clusters of cottages which they passed , without stopping , and one lonely road-side public-house where they had some bread and cheese , this highway had led them to nothing -- late in the afternoon -- and still lengthened out , far in the distance , the same dull , tedious , winding course , that they had been pursuing all day .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 31]: As they had no resource , however , but to go forward , they still kept on , though at a much slower pace , being very weary and fatigued .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 29]: The afternoon had worn away into a beautiful evening , when they arrived at a point where the road made a sharp turn and struck across a common .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 52]: On the border of this common , and close to the hedge which divided it from the cultivated fields , a caravan was drawn up to rest ; upon which , by reason of its situation , they came so suddenly that they could not have avoided it if they would .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 50]: It was not a shabby , dingy , dusty cart , but a smart little house upon wheels , with white dimity curtains festooning the windows , and window-shutters of green picked out with panels of a staring red , in which happily-contrasted colours the whole concern shone brilliant .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 36]: Neither was it a poor caravan drawn by a single donkey or emaciated horse , for a pair of horses in pretty good condition were released from the shafts and grazing on the frouzy grass .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 41]: Neither was it a gipsy caravan , for at the open door -LRB- graced with a bright brass knocker -RRB- sat a Christian lady , stout and comfortable to look upon , who wore a large bonnet trembling with bows .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 30]: And that it was not an unprovided or destitute caravan was clear from this lady 's occupation , which was the very pleasant and refreshing one of taking tea .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 58]: The tea-things , including a bottle of rather suspicious character and a cold knuckle of ham , were set forth upon a drum , covered with a white napkin ; and there , as if at the most convenient round-table in all the world , sat this roving lady , taking her tea and enjoying the prospect .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 109]: It happened that at that moment the lady of the caravan had her cup -LRB- which , that everything about her might be of a stout and comfortable kind , was a breakfast cup -RRB- to her lips , and that having her eyes lifted to the sky in her enjoyment of the full flavour of the tea , not unmingled possibly with just the slightest dash or gleam of something out of the suspicious bottle -- but this is mere speculation and not distinct matter of history -- it happened that being thus agreeably engaged , she did not see the travellers when they first came up .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 61]: It was not until she was in the act of getting down the cup , and drawing a long breath after the exertion of causing its contents to disappear , that the lady of the caravan beheld an old man and a young child walking slowly by , and glancing at her proceedings with eyes of modest but hungry admiration .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 4]: ` Hey ! '
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 23]: cried the lady of the caravan , scooping the crumbs out of her lap and swallowing the same before wiping her lips .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 18]: ` Yes , to be sure -- Who won the Helter -- Skelter Plate , child ? '
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 7]: ` Won what , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 3]: asked Nell .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 24]: ` The Helter -- Skelter Plate at the races , child -- the plate that was run for on the second day . '
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 9]: ` On the second day , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 4]: ` Second day !
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 15]: Yes , second day , ' repeated the lady with an air of impatience .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 22]: ` Ca n't you say who won the Helter -- Skelter Plate when you 're asked the question civilly ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 8]: I do n't know , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 6]: ` Do n't know ! '
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 14]: repeated the lady of the caravan ; ` why , you were there .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 9]: I saw you with my own eyes . '
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 34]: Nell was not a little alarmed to hear this , supposing that the lady might be intimately acquainted with the firm of Short and Codlin ; but what followed tended to reassure her .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 43]: ` And very sorry I was , ' said the lady of the caravan , ` to see you in company with a Punch ; a low , practical , wulgar wretch , that people should scorn to look at . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 37]: I was not there by choice , ' returned the child ; ` we did n't know our way , and the two men were very kind to us , and let us travel with them .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 11]: Do you -- do you know them , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 7]: ` Know 'em , child ! '
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 12]: cried the lady of the caravan in a sort of shriek .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 4]: ` Know them !
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 18]: But you 're young and inexperienced , and that 's your excuse for asking sich a question .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 22]: Do I look as if I know 'd 'em , does the caravan look as if it know 'd 'em ? '
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 21]: ` No , ma'am , no , ' said the child , fearing she had committed some grievous fault . '
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 6]: I beg your pardon . '
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 19]: It was granted immediately , though the lady still appeared much ruffled and discomposed by the degrading supposition .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 34]: The child then explained that they had left the races on the first day , and were travelling to the next town on that road , where they purposed to spend the night .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 21]: As the countenance of the stout lady began to clear up , she ventured to inquire how far it was .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 64]: The reply -- which the stout lady did not come to , until she had thoroughly explained that she went to the races on the first day in a gig , and as an expedition of pleasure , and that her presence there had no connexion with any matters of business or profit -- was , that the town was eight miles off .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 23]: This discouraging information a little dashed the child , who could scarcely repress a tear as she glanced along the darkening road .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 26]: Her grandfather made no complaint , but he sighed heavily as he leaned upon his staff , and vainly tried to pierce the dusty distance .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 33]: The lady of the caravan was in the act of gathering her tea equipage together preparatory to clearing the table , but noting the child 's anxious manner she hesitated and stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 40]: The child curtseyed , thanked her for her information , and giving her hand to the old man had already got some fifty yards or so away , when the lady of the caravan called to her to return .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 19]: ` Come nearer , nearer still , ' said she , beckoning to her to ascend the steps .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 8]: ` Are you hungry , child ? '
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 20]: ` Not very , but we are tired , and it 's -- it IS a long way . '
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 21]: ` Well , hungry or not , you had better have some tea , ' rejoined her new acquaintance . '
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 12]: I suppose you are agreeable to that , old gentleman ? '
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 11]: The grandfather humbly pulled off his hat and thanked her .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 80]: The lady of the caravan then bade him come up the steps likewise , but the drum proving an inconvenient table for two , they descended again , and sat upon the grass , where she handed down to them the tea-tray , the bread and butter , the knuckle of ham , and in short everything of which she had partaken herself , except the bottle which she had already embraced an opportunity of slipping into her pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 28]: ` Set 'em out near the hind wheels , child , that 's the best place , ' said their friend , superintending the arrangements from above .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 49]: ` Now hand up the teapot for a little more hot water , and a pinch of fresh tea , and then both of you eat and drink as much as you can , and do n't spare anything ; that 's all I ask of you . '
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 30]: They might perhaps have carried out the lady 's wish , if it had been less freely expressed , or even if it had not been expressed at all .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 26]: But as this direction relieved them from any shadow of delicacy or uneasiness , they made a hearty meal and enjoyed it to the utmost .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 71]: While they were thus engaged , the lady of the caravan alighted on the earth , and with her hands clasped behind her , and her large bonnet trembling excessively , walked up and down in a measured tread and very stately manner , surveying the caravan from time to time with an air of calm delight , and deriving particular gratification from the red panels and the brass knocker .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 97]: When she had taken this gentle exercise for some time , she sat down upon the steps and called ` George ' ; whereupon a man in a carter 's frock , who had been so shrouded in a hedge up to this time as to see everything that passed without being seen himself , parted the twigs that concealed him , and appeared in a sitting attitude , supporting on his legs a baking-dish and a half-gallon stone bottle , and bearing in his right hand a knife , and in his left a fork .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 9]: ` Yes , Missus , ' said George .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 12]: ` How did you find the cold pie , George ? '
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 9]: ` It war n't amiss , mum . '
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 35]: ` And the beer , ' said the lady of the caravan , with an appearance of being more interested in this question than the last ; ` is it passable , George ? '
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 26]: ` It 's more flatterer than it might be , ' George returned , ` but it a n't so bad for all that . '
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 44]: To set the mind of his mistress at rest , he took a sip -LRB- amounting in quantity to a pint or thereabouts -RRB- from the stone bottle , and then smacked his lips , winked his eye , and nodded his head .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 32]: No doubt with the same amiable desire , he immediately resumed his knife and fork , as a practical assurance that the beer had wrought no bad effect upon his appetite .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 23]: The lady of the caravan looked on approvingly for some time , and then said , ` Have you nearly finished ? '
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 7]: ` Wery nigh , mum . '
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 77]: And indeed , after scraping the dish all round with his knife and carrying the choice brown morsels to his mouth , and after taking such a scientific pull at the stone bottle that , by degrees almost imperceptible to the sight , his head went further and further back until he lay nearly at his full length upon the ground , this gentleman declared himself quite disengaged , and came forth from his retreat . '
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 27]: I hope I have n't hurried you , George , ' said his mistress , who appeared to have a great sympathy with his late pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 36]: ` If you have , ' returned the follower , wisely reserving himself for any favourable contingency that might occur , ` we must make up for it next time , that 's all . '
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 11]: ` We are not a heavy load , George ? '
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 34]: ` That 's always what the ladies say , ' replied the man , looking a long way round , as if he were appealing to Nature in general against such monstrous propositions .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 32]: ` If you see a woman a driving , you 'll always perceive that she never will keep her whip still ; the horse ca n't go fast enough for her .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 22]: If cattle have got their proper load , you never can persuade a woman that they 'll not bear something more .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 10]: What is ' the cause of this here ? '
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 20]: ` Would these two travellers make much difference to the horses , if we took them with us ? '
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 32]: asked his mistress , offering no reply to the philosophical inquiry , and pointing to Nell and the old man , who were painfully preparing to resume their journey on foot .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 14]: ` They 'd make a difference in course , ' said George doggedly .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 8]: ` Would they make much difference ? '
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 4]: repeated his mistress .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 9]: ` They ca n't be very heavy . '
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 44]: ` The weight o ' the pair , mum , ' said George , eyeing them with the look of a man who was calculating within half an ounce or so , ` would be a trifle under that of Oliver Cromwell . ''
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 63]: Nell was very much surprised that the man should be so accurately acquainted with the weight of one whom she had read of in books as having lived considerably before their time , but speedily forgot the subject in the joy of hearing that they were to go forward in the caravan , for which she thanked its lady with unaffected earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 41]: She helped with great readiness and alacrity to put away the tea-things and other matters that were lying about , and , the horses being by that time harnessed , mounted into the vehicle , followed by her delighted grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 74]: Their patroness then shut the door and sat herself down by her drum at an open window ; and , the steps being struck by George and stowed under the carriage , away they went , with a great noise of flapping and creaking and straining , and the bright brass knocker , which nobody ever knocked at , knocking one perpetual double knock of its own accord as they jolted heavily along .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 28]: Chapter 27 When they had travelled slowly forward for some short distance , Nell ventured to steal a look round the caravan and observe it more closely .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 87]: One half of it -- that moiety in which the comfortable proprietress was then seated -- was carpeted , and so partitioned off at the further end as to accommodate a sleeping-place , constructed after the fashion of a berth on board ship , which was shaded , like the little windows , with fair white curtains , and looked comfortable enough , though by what kind of gymnastic exercise the lady of the caravan ever contrived to get into it , was an unfathomable mystery .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 23]: The other half served for a kitchen , and was fitted up with a stove whose small chimney passed through the roof .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 26]: It held also a closet or larder , several chests , a great pitcher of water , and a few cooking-utensils and articles of crockery .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 42]: These latter necessaries hung upon the walls , which , in that portion of the establishment devoted to the lady of the caravan , were ornamented with such gayer and lighter decorations as a triangle and a couple of well-thumbed tambourines .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 53]: The lady of the caravan sat at one window in all the pride and poetry of the musical instruments , and little Nell and her grandfather sat at the other in all the humility of the kettle and saucepans , while the machine jogged on and shifted the darkening prospect very slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 73]: At first the two travellers spoke little , and only in whispers , but as they grew more familiar with the place they ventured to converse with greater freedom , and talked about the country through which they were passing , and the different objects that presented themselves , until the old man fell asleep ; which the lady of the caravan observing , invited Nell to come and sit beside her .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 20]: ` Well , child , ' she said , ` how do you like this way of travelling ? '
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 26]: Nell replied that she thought it was very pleasant indeed , to which the lady assented in the case of people who had their spirits .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 49]: For herself , she said , she was troubled with a lowness in that respect which required a constant stimulant ; though whether the aforesaid stimulant was derived from the suspicious bottle of which mention has been already made or from other sources , she did not say .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 14]: ` That 's the happiness of you young people , ' she continued .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 15]: ` You do n't know what it is to be low in your feelings .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 15]: You always have your appetites too , and what a comfort that is . '
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 57]: Nell thought that she could sometimes dispense with her own appetite very conveniently ; and thought , moreover , that there was nothing either in the lady 's personal appearance or in her manner of taking tea , to lead to the conclusion that her natural relish for meat and drink had at all failed her .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 26]: She silently assented , however , as in duty bound , to what the lady had said , and waited until she should speak again .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 66]: Instead of speaking , however , she sat looking at the child for a long time in silence , and then getting up , brought out from a corner a large roll of canvas about a yard in width , which she laid upon the floor and spread open with her foot until it nearly reached from one end of the caravan to the other .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 14]: ` There , child , ' she said , ` read that . '
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 25]: Nell walked down it , and read aloud , in enormous black letters , the inscription , ` Jarley 's WAX -- WORK . '
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 12]: ` Read it again , ' said the lady , complacently .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 11]: ` Jarley 's Wax -- Work , ' repeated Nell .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 11]: ` That 's me , ' said the lady . '
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 6]: I am Mrs Jarley . '
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 143]: Giving the child an encouraging look , intended to reassure her and let her know , that , although she stood in the presence of the original Jarley , she must not allow herself to be utterly overwhelmed and borne down , the lady of the caravan unfolded another scroll , whereon was the inscription , ` One hundred figures the full size of life , ' and then another scroll , on which was written , ` The only stupendous collection of real wax-work in the world , ' and then several smaller scrolls with such inscriptions as ` Now exhibiting within ' -- ` The genuine and only Jarley ' -- ` Jarley 's unrivalled collection ' -- ` Jarley is the delight of the Nobility and Gentry ' -- ` The Royal Family are the patrons of Jarley . '
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 137]: When she had exhibited these leviathans of public announcement to the astonished child , she brought forth specimens of the lesser fry in the shape of hand-bills , some of which were couched in the form of parodies on popular melodies , as ` Believe me if all Jarley 's wax-work so rare ' -- ' I saw thy show in youthful prime ' -- ` Over the water to Jarley ; ' while , to consult all tastes , others were composed with a view to the lighter and more facetious spirits , as a parody on the favourite air of ` If I had a donkey , ' beginning If I know 'd a donkey wot would n't go To see Mrs JARLEY 'S wax-work show , Do you think I 'd acknowledge him ?
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 4]: Oh no no !
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 69]: Then run to Jarley 's -- -- besides several compositions in prose , purporting to be dialogues between the Emperor of China and an oyster , or the Archbishop of Canterbury and a dissenter on the subject of church-rates , but all having the same moral , namely , that the reader must make haste to Jarley 's , and that children and servants were admitted at half-price .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 45]: When she had brought all these testimonials of her important position in society to bear upon her young companion , Mrs Jarley rolled them up , and having put them carefully away , sat down again , and looked at the child in triumph .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 24]: ` Never go into the company of a filthy Punch any more , ' said Mrs Jarley , ` after this . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 12]: I never saw any wax-work , ma'am , ' said Nell .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 8]: ` Is it funnier than Punch ? '
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 4]: ` Funnier ! '
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 8]: said Mrs Jarley in a shrill voice .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 9]: ` It is not funny at all . '
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 8]: said Nell , with all possible humility .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 13]: ` It is n't funny at all , ' repeated Mrs Jarley .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 14]: ` It 's calm and -- what 's that word again -- critical ?
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 15]: -- no -- classical , that 's it -- it 's calm and classical .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 52]: No low beatings and knockings about , no jokings and squeakings like your precious Punches , but always the same , with a constantly unchanging air of coldness and gentility ; and so like life , that if wax-work only spoke and walked about , you 'd hardly know the difference .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 38]: I wo n't go so far as to say , that , as it is , I 've seen wax-work quite like life , but I 've certainly seen some life that was exactly like wax-work . '
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 8]: ` Is it here , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 11]: asked Nell , whose curiosity was awakened by this description .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 8]: ` Is what here , child ? '
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 7]: ` The wax-work , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 14]: ` Why , bless you , child , what are you thinking of ?
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 24]: How could such a collection be here , where you see everything except the inside of one little cupboard and a few boxes ?
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 23]: It 's gone on in the other wans to the assembly-rooms , and there it 'll be exhibited the day after to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 17]: You are going to the same town , and you 'll see it I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 19]: It 's natural to expect that you 'll see it , and I 've no doubt you will .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 18]: I suppose you could n't stop away if you was to try ever so much . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 18]: I shall not be in the town , I think , ma'am , ' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 5]: ` Not there ! '
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 4]: cried Mrs Jarley .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 8]: ` Then where will you be ? '
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 10]: ` I -- I -- do n't quite know .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 6]: I am not certain . '
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 23]: ` You do n't mean to say that you 're travelling about the country without knowing where you 're going to ? '
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 7]: said the lady of the caravan .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 7]: ` What curious people you are !
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 6]: What line are you in ?
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 28]: You looked to me at the races , child , as if you were quite out of your element , and had got there by accident . '
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 18]: ` We were there quite by accident , ' returned Nell , confused by this abrupt questioning .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 14]: ` We are poor people , ma'am , and are only wandering about .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 13]: We have nothing to do ; -- I wish we had . '
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 27]: ` You amaze me more and more , ' said Mrs Jarley , after remaining for some time as mute as one of her own figures .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 9]: ` Why , what do you call yourselves ?
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 4]: Not beggars ? '
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 19]: ` Indeed , ma'am , I do n't know what else we are , ' returned the child .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 14]: ` Lord bless me , ' said the lady of the caravan . '
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 8]: I never heard of such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 7]: Who 'd have thought it ! '
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 41]: She remained so long silent after this exclamation , that Nell feared she felt her having been induced to bestow her protection and conversation upon one so poor , to be an outrage upon her dignity that nothing could repair .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 27]: This persuasion was rather confirmed than otherwise by the tone in which she at length broke silence and said , ` And yet you can read .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 10]: And write too , I should n't wonder ? '
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 19]: ` Yes , ma'am , ' said the child , fearful of giving new offence by the confession .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 16]: ` Well , and what a thing that is , ' returned Mrs Jarley . '
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 5]: I ca n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 68]: Nell said ` indeed ' in a tone which might imply , either that she was reasonably surprised to find the genuine and only Jarley , who was the delight of the Nobility and Gentry and the peculiar pet of the Royal Family , destitute of these familiar arts ; or that she presumed so great a lady could scarcely stand in need of such ordinary accomplishments .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 61]: In whatever way Mrs Jarley received the response , it did not provoke her to further questioning , or tempt her into any more remarks at the time , for she relapsed into a thoughtful silence , and remained in that state so long that Nell withdrew to the other window and rejoined her grandfather , who was now awake .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 67]: At length the lady of the caravan shook off her fit of meditation , and , summoning the driver to come under the window at which she was seated , held a long conversation with him in a low tone of voice , as if she were asking his advice on an important point , and discussing the pros and cons of some very weighty matter .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 19]: This conference at length concluded , she drew in her head again , and beckoned Nell to approach .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 23]: ` And the old gentleman too , ' said Mrs Jarley ; ` for I want to have a word with him .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 12]: Do you want a good situation for your grand-daughter , master ?
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 15]: If you do , I can put her in the way of getting one .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 7]: What do you say ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 12]: I ca n't leave her , ' answered the old man .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 6]: ` We ca n't separate .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 10]: What would become of me without her ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 26]: I should have thought you were old enough to take care of yourself , if you ever will be , ' retorted Mrs Jarley sharply .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 17]: ` But he never will be , ' said the child in an earnest whisper . '
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 8]: I fear he never will be again .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 8]: Pray do not speak harshly to him .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 35]: We are very thankful to you , ' she added aloud ; ` but neither of us could part from the other if all the wealth of the world were halved between us . '
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 50]: Mrs Jarley was a little disconcerted by this reception of her proposal , and looked at the old man , who tenderly took Nell 's hand and detained it in his own , as if she could have very well dispensed with his company or even his earthly existence .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 57]: After an awkward pause , she thrust her head out of the window again , and had another conference with the driver upon some point on which they did not seem to agree quite so readily as on their former topic of discussion ; but they concluded at last , and she addressed the grandfather again .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 43]: ` If you 're really disposed to employ yourself , ' said Mrs Jarley , ` there would be plenty for you to do in the way of helping to dust the figures , and take the checks , and so forth .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 75]: What I want your grand-daughter for , is to point 'em out to the company ; they would be soon learnt , and she has a way with her that people would n't think unpleasant , though she does come after me ; for I 've been always accustomed to go round with visitors myself , which I should keep on doing now , only that my spirits make a little ease absolutely necessary .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 41]: It 's not a common offer , bear in mind , ' said the lady , rising into the tone and manner in which she was accustomed to address her audiences ; ` it 's Jarley 's wax-work , remember .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 31]: The duty 's very light and genteel , the company particularly select , the exhibition takes place in assembly-rooms , town-halls , large rooms at inns , or auction galleries .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 25]: There is none of your open-air wagrancy at Jarley 's , recollect ; there is no tarpaulin and sawdust at Jarley 's , remember .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 28]: Every expectation held out in the handbills is realised to the utmost , and the whole forms an effect of imposing brilliancy hitherto unrivalled in this kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 23]: Remember that the price of admission is only sixpence , and that this is an opportunity which may never occur again ! '
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 54]: Descending from the sublime when she had reached this point , to the details of common life , Mrs Jarley remarked that with reference to salary she could pledge herself to no specific sum until she had sufficiently tested Nell 's abilities , and narrowly watched her in the performance of her duties .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 39]: But board and lodging , both for her and her grandfather , she bound herself to provide , and she furthermore passed her word that the board should always be good in quality , and in quantity plentiful .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 45]: Nell and her grandfather consulted together , and while they were so engaged , Mrs Jarley with her hands behind her walked up and down the caravan , as she had walked after tea on the dull earth , with uncommon dignity and self-esteem .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 49]: Nor will this appear so slight a circumstance as to be unworthy of mention , when it is remembered that the caravan was in uneasy motion all the time , and that none but a person of great natural stateliness and acquired grace could have forborne to stagger .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 6]: ` Now , child ? '
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 14]: cried Mrs Jarley , coming to a halt as Nell turned towards her .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 23]: ` We are very much obliged to you , ma'am , ' said Nell , ` and thankfully accept your offer . '
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 15]: ` And you 'll never be sorry for it , ' returned Mrs Jarley .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 8]: ` I 'm pretty sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 16]: So as that 's all settled , let us have a bit of supper . '
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 57]: In the meanwhile , the caravan blundered on as if it too had been drinking strong beer and was drowsy , and came at last upon the paved streets of a town which were clear of passengers , and quiet , for it was by this time near midnight , and the townspeople were all abed .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 113]: As it was too late an hour to repair to the exhibition room , they turned aside into a piece of waste ground that lay just within the old town-gate , and drew up there for the night , near to another caravan , which , notwithstanding that it bore on the lawful panel the great name of Jarley , and was employed besides in conveying from place to place the wax-work which was its country 's pride , was designated by a grovelling stamp-office as a ` Common Stage Waggon , ' and numbered too -- seven thousand odd hundred -- as though its precious freight were mere flour or coals !
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 63]: This ill-used machine being empty -LRB- for it had deposited its burden at the place of exhibition , and lingered here until its services were again required -RRB- was assigned to the old man as his sleeping-place for the night ; and within its wooden walls , Nell made him up the best bed she could , from the materials at hand .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 26]: For herself , she was to sleep in Mrs Jarley 's own travelling-carriage , as a signal mark of that lady 's favour and confidence .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 35]: She had taken leave of her grandfather and was returning to the other waggon , when she was tempted by the coolness of the night to linger for a little while in the air .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 65]: The moon was shining down upon the old gateway of the town , leaving the low archway very black and dark ; and with a mingled sensation of curiosity and fear , she slowly approached the gate , and stood still to look up at it , wondering to see how dark , and grim , and old , and cold , it looked .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 78]: There was an empty niche from which some old statue had fallen or been carried away hundreds of years ago , and she was thinking what strange people it must have looked down upon when it stood there , and how many hard struggles might have taken place , and how many murders might have been done , upon that silent spot , when there suddenly emerged from the black shade of the arch , a man .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 25]: The instant he appeared , she recognised him -- Who could have failed to recognise , in that instant , the ugly misshapen Quilp !
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 33]: The street beyond was so narrow , and the shadow of the houses on one side of the way so deep , that he seemed to have risen out of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 5]: But there he was .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 16]: The child withdrew into a dark corner , and saw him pass close to her .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 44]: He had a stick in his hand , and , when he had got clear of the shadow of the gateway , he leant upon it , looked back -- directly , as it seemed , towards where she stood -- and beckoned .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 3]: To her ?
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 65]: oh no , thank God , not to her ; for as she stood , in an extremity of fear , hesitating whether to scream for help , or come from her hiding-place and fly , before he should draw nearer , there issued slowly forth from the arch another figure -- that of a boy -- who carried on his back a trunk .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 6]: ` Faster , sirrah ! '
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 41]: cried Quilp , looking up at the old gateway , and showing in the moonlight like some monstrous image that had come down from its niche and was casting a backward glance at its old house , ` faster ! '
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 15]: ` It 's a dreadful heavy load , Sir , ' the boy pleaded .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 11]: ` I 've come on very fast , considering . '
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 9]: ` YOU have come fast , considering ! '
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 20]: retorted Quilp ; ` you creep , you dog , you crawl , you measure distance like a worm .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 10]: There are the chimes now , half-past twelve . '
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 35]: He stopped to listen , and then turning upon the boy with a suddenness and ferocity that made him start , asked at what hour that London coach passed the corner of the road .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 7]: The boy replied , at one .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 17]: ` Come on then , ' said Quilp , ` or I shall be too late .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 7]: Faster -- do you hear me ?
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 3]: Faster . '
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 28]: The boy made all the speed he could , and Quilp led onward , constantly turning back to threaten him , and urge him to greater haste .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 47]: Nell did not dare to move until they were out of sight and hearing , and then hurried to where she had left her grandfather , feeling as if the very passing of the dwarf so near him must have filled him with alarm and terror .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 11]: But he was sleeping soundly , and she softly withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 89]: As she was making her way to her own bed , she determined to say nothing of this adventure , as upon whatever errand the dwarf had come -LRB- and she feared it must have been in search of them -RRB- it was clear by his inquiry about the London coach that he was on his way homeward , and as he had passed through that place , it was but reasonable to suppose that they were safer from his inquiries there , than they could be elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 45]: These reflections did not remove her own alarm , for she had been too much terrified to be easily composed , and felt as if she were hemmed in by a legion of Quilps , and the very air itself were filled with them .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 64]: The delight of the Nobility and Gentry and the patronised of Royalty had , by some process of self-abridgment known only to herself , got into her travelling bed , where she was snoring peacefully , while the large bonnet , carefully disposed upon the drum , was revealing its glories by the light of a dim lamp that swung from the roof .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 52]: The child 's bed was already made upon the floor , and it was a great comfort to her to hear the steps removed as soon as she had entered , and to know that all easy communication between persons outside and the brass knocker was by this means effectually prevented .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 50]: Certain guttural sounds , too , which from time to time ascended through the floor of the caravan , and a rustling of straw in the same direction , apprised her that the driver was couched upon the ground beneath , and gave her an additional feeling of security .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 74]: Notwithstanding these protections , she could get none but broken sleep by fits and starts all night , for fear of Quilp , who throughout her uneasy dreams was somehow connected with the wax-work , or was wax-work himself , or was Mrs Jarley and wax-work too , or was himself , Mrs Jarley , wax-work , and a barrel organ all in one , and yet not exactly any of them either .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 34]: At length , towards break of day , that deep sleep came upon her which succeeds to weariness and over-watching , and which has no consciousness but one of overpowering and irresistible enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 36]: Chapter 28 Sleep hung upon the eyelids of the child so long , that , when she awoke , Mrs Jarley was already decorated with her large bonnet , and actively engaged in preparing breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 31]: She received Nell 's apology for being so late with perfect good humour , and said that she should not have roused her if she had slept on until noon .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 56]: ` Because it does you good , ' said the lady of the caravan , ` when you 're tired , to sleep as long as ever you can , and get the fatigue quite off ; and that 's another blessing of your time of life -- you can sleep so very sound . '
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 11]: ` Have you had a bad night , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 4]: asked Nell . '
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 21]: I seldom have anything else , child , ' replied Mrs Jarley , with the air of a martyr . '
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 9]: I sometimes wonder how I bear it . '
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 35]: Remembering the snores which had proceeded from that cleft in the caravan in which the proprietress of the wax-work passed the night , Nell rather thought she must have been dreaming of lying awake .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 33]: However , she expressed herself very sorry to hear such a dismal account of her state of health , and shortly afterwards sat down with her grandfather and Mrs Jarley to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 50]: The meal finished , Nell assisted to wash the cups and saucers , and put them in their proper places , and these household duties performed , Mrs Jarley arrayed herself in an exceedingly bright shawl for the purpose of making a progress through the streets of the town .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 26]: ` The wan will come on to bring the boxes , ' said Mrs Jarley , and you had better come in it , child .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 37]: I am obliged to walk , very much against my will ; but the people expect it of me , and public characters ca n't be their own masters and mistresses in such matters as these .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 8]: How do I look , child ? '
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 51]: Nell returned a satisfactory reply , and Mrs Jarley , after sticking a great many pins into various parts of her figure , and making several abortive attempts to obtain a full view of her own back , was at last satisfied with her appearance , and went forth majestically .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 8]: The caravan followed at no great distance .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 39]: As it went jolting through the streets , Nell peeped from the window , curious to see in what kind of place they were , and yet fearful of encountering at every turn the dreaded face of Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 37]: It was a pretty large town , with an open square which they were crawling slowly across , and in the middle of which was the Town -- Hall , with a clock-tower and a weather-cock .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 48]: There were houses of stone , houses of red brick , houses of yellow brick , houses of lath and plaster ; and houses of wood , many of them very old , with withered faces carved upon the beams , and staring down into the street .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 25]: These had very little winking windows , and low-arched doors , and , in some of the narrower ways , quite overhung the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 16]: The streets were very clean , very sunny , very empty , and very dull .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 75]: A few idle men lounged about the two inns , and the empty market-place , and the tradesmen 's doors , and some old people were dozing in chairs outside an alms-house wall ; but scarcely any passengers who seemed bent on going anywhere , or to have any object in view , went by ; and if perchance some straggler did , his footsteps echoed on the hot bright pavement for minutes afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 35]: Nothing seemed to be going on but the clocks , and they had such drowzy faces , such heavy lazy hands , and such cracked voices that they surely must have been too slow .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 38]: The very dogs were all asleep , and the flies , drunk with moist sugar in the grocer 's shop , forgot their wings and briskness , and baked to death in dusty corners of the window .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 58]: Rumbling along with most unwonted noise , the caravan stopped at last at the place of exhibition , where Nell dismounted amidst an admiring group of children , who evidently supposed her to be an important item of the curiosities , and were fully impressed with the belief that her grandfather was a cunning device in wax .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 70]: The chests were taken out with all convenient despatch , and taken in to be unlocked by Mrs Jarley , who , attended by George and another man in velveteen shorts and a drab hat ornamented with turnpike tickets , were waiting to dispose their contents -LRB- consisting of red festoons and other ornamental devices in upholstery work -RRB- to the best advantage in the decoration of the room .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 16]: They all got to work without loss of time , and very busy they were .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 41]: As the stupendous collection were yet concealed by cloths , lest the envious dust should injure their complexions , Nell bestirred herself to assist in the embellishment of the room , in which her grandfather also was of great service .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 49]: The two men being well used to it , did a great deal in a short time ; and Mrs Jarley served out the tin tacks from a linen pocket like a toll-collector 's which she wore for the purpose , and encouraged her assistants to renewed exertion .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 86]: While they were thus employed , a tallish gentleman with a hook nose and black hair , dressed in a military surtout very short and tight in the sleeves , and which had once been frogged and braided all over , but was now sadly shorn of its garniture and quite threadbare -- dressed too in ancient grey pantaloons fitting tight to the leg , and a pair of pumps in the winter of their existence -- looked in at the door and smiled affably .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 50]: Mrs Jarley 's back being then towards him , the military gentleman shook his forefinger as a sign that her myrmidons were not to apprise her of his presence , and stealing up close behind her , tapped her on the neck , and cried playfully ` Boh ! '
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 7]: ` What , Mr Slum ! '
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 7]: cried the lady of the wax-work .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 3]: ` Lot !
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 11]: who 'd have thought of seeing you here ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 18]: Pon my soul and honour , ' said Mr Slum , ` that 's a good remark .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 12]: ` Pon my soul and honour that 's a wise remark .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 6]: Who would have thought it !
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 11]: George , my faithful feller , how are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 29]: George received this advance with a surly indifference , observing that he was well enough for the matter of that , and hammering lustily all the time . '
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 29]: I came here , ' said the military gentleman turning to Mrs Jarley -- '' pon my soul and honour I hardly know what I came here for .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 13]: It would puzzle me to tell you , it would by Gad .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 49]: I wanted a little inspiration , a little freshening up , a little change of ideas , and -- ` Pon my soul and honour , ' said the military gentleman , checking himself and looking round the room , ` what a devilish classical thing this is !
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 9]: by Gad , it 's quite Minervian . '
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 18]: ` It 'll look well enough when it comes to be finished , ' observed Mrs Jarley .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 5]: ` Well enough ! '
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 4]: said Mr Slum .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 34]: ` Will you believe me when I say it 's the delight of my life to have dabbled in poetry , when I think I 've exercised my pen upon this charming theme ?
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 7]: By the way -- any orders ?
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 12]: Is there any little thing I can do for you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 27]: ` It comes so very expensive , sir , ' replied Mrs Jarley , ` and I really do n't think it does much good . '
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 3]: ` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 5]: No , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 8]: returned Mr Slum , elevating his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 4]: ` No fibs .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 6]: I 'll not hear it .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 9]: Do n't say it do n't do good .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 5]: Do n't say it .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 6]: I know better ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 12]: I do n't think it does , ' said Mrs Jarley .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 6]: ` Ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 15]: cried Mr Slum , ` you 're giving way , you 're coming down .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 42]: Ask the perfumers , ask the blacking-makers , ask the hatters , ask the old lottery-office-keepers -- ask any man among 'em what my poetry has done for him , and mark my words , he blesses the name of Slum .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 24]: If he 's an honest man , he raises his eyes to heaven , and blesses the name of Slum -- mark that !
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 11]: You are acquainted with Westminster Abbey , Mrs Jarley ? '
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 6]: ` Yes , surely . '
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 58]: ` Then upon my soul and honour , ma'am , you 'll find in a certain angle of that dreary pile , called Poets ' Corner , a few smaller names than Slum , ' retorted that gentleman , tapping himself expressively on the forehead to imply that there was some slight quantity of brain behind it .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 61]: ` I 've got a little trifle here , now , ' said Mr Slum , taking off his hat which was full of scraps of paper , ' a little trifle here , thrown off in the heat of the moment , which I should say was exactly the thing you wanted to set this place on fire with .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 28]: It 's an acrostic -- the name at this moment is Warren , and the idea 's a convertible one , and a positive inspiration for Jarley .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 6]: Have the acrostic . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 12]: I suppose it 's very dear , ' said Mrs Jarley .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 16]: ` Five shillings , ' returned Mr Slum , using his pencil as a toothpick .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 8]: ` Cheaper than any prose . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 14]: I could n't give more than three , ' said Mrs Jarley . '
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 8]: -- And six , ' retorted Slum .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 3]: ` Come .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 3]: Three-and-six . '
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 27]: Mrs Jarley was not proof against the poet 's insinuating manner , and Mr Slum entered the order in a small note-book as a three-and-sixpenny one .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 39]: Mr Slum then withdrew to alter the acrostic , after taking a most affectionate leave of his patroness , and promising to return , as soon as he possibly could , with a fair copy for the printer .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 26]: As his presence had not interfered with or interrupted the preparations , they were now far advanced , and were completed shortly after his departure .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 119]: When the festoons were all put up as tastily as they might be , the stupendous collection was uncovered , and there were displayed , on a raised platform some two feet from the floor , running round the room and parted from the rude public by a crimson rope breast high , divers sprightly effigies of celebrated characters , singly and in groups , clad in glittering dresses of various climes and times , and standing more or less unsteadily upon their legs , with their eyes very wide open , and their nostrils very much inflated , and the muscles of their legs and arms very strongly developed , and all their countenances expressing great surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 42]: All the gentlemen were very pigeon-breasted and very blue about the beards ; and all the ladies were miraculous figures ; and all the ladies and all the gentlemen were looking intensely nowhere , and staring with extraordinary earnestness at nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 70]: When Nell had exhausted her first raptures at this glorious sight , Mrs Jarley ordered the room to be cleared of all but herself and the child , and , sitting herself down in an arm-chair in the centre , formally invested Nell with a willow wand , long used by herself for pointing out the characters , and was at great pains to instruct her in her duty .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 52]: ` That , ' said Mrs Jarley in her exhibition tone , as Nell touched a figure at the beginning of the platform , ` is an unfortunate Maid of Honour in the Time of Queen Elizabeth , who died from pricking her finger in consequence of working upon a Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 26]: Observe the blood which is trickling from her finger ; also the gold-eyed needle of the period , with which she is at work . '
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 29]: All this , Nell repeated twice or thrice : pointing to the finger and the needle at the right times : and then passed on to the next .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 51]: ` That , ladies and gentlemen , ' said Mrs Jarley , ` is jasper Packlemerton of atrocious memory , who courted and married fourteen wives , and destroyed them all , by tickling the soles of their feet when they were sleeping in the consciousness of innocence and virtue .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 44]: On being brought to the scaffold and asked if he was sorry for what he had done , he replied yes , he was sorry for having let 'em off so easy , and hoped all Christian husbands would pardon him the offence .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 22]: Let this be a warning to all young ladies to be particular in the character of the gentlemen of their choice .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 34]: Observe that his fingers are curled as if in the act of tickling , and that his face is represented with a wink , as he appeared when committing his barbarous murders . '
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 79]: When Nell knew all about Mr Packlemerton , and could say it without faltering , Mrs Jarley passed on to the fat man , and then to the thin man , the tall man , the short man , the old lady who died of dancing at a hundred and thirty-two , the wild boy of the woods , the woman who poisoned fourteen families with pickled walnuts , and other historical characters and interesting but misguided individuals .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 57]: And so well did Nell profit by her instructions , and so apt was she to remember them , that by the time they had been shut up together for a couple of hours , she was in full possession of the history of the whole establishment , and perfectly competent to the enlightenment of visitors .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 134]: Mrs Jarley was not slow to express her admiration at this happy result , and carried her young friend and pupil to inspect the remaining arrangements within doors , by virtue of which the passage had been already converted into a grove of green-baize hung with the inscription she had already seen -LRB- Mr Slum 's productions -RRB- , and a highly ornamented table placed at the upper end for Mrs Jarley herself , at which she was to preside and take the money , in company with his Majesty King George the Third , Mr Grimaldi as clown , Mary Queen of Scots , an anonymous gentleman of the Quaker persuasion , and Mr Pitt holding in his hand a correct model of the bill for the imposition of the window duty .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 64]: The preparations without doors had not been neglected either ; a nun of great personal attractions was telling her beads on the little portico over the door ; and a brigand with the blackest possible head of hair , and the clearest possible complexion , was at that moment going round the town in a cart , consulting the miniature of a lady .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 65]: It now only remained that Mr Slum 's compositions should be judiciously distributed ; that the pathetic effusions should find their way to all private houses and tradespeople ; and that the parody commencing ` If I know 'd a donkey , ' should be confined to the taverns , and circulated only among the lawyers ' clerks and choice spirits of the place .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 70]: When this had been done , and Mrs Jarley had waited upon the boarding-schools in person , with a handbill composed expressly for them , in which it was distinctly proved that wax-work refined the mind , cultivated the taste , and enlarged the sphere of the human understanding , that indefatigable lady sat down to dinner , and drank out of the suspicious bottle to a flourishing campaign .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 10]: Chapter 29 Unquestionably Mrs Jarley had an inventive genius .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 20]: In the midst of the various devices for attracting visitors to the exhibition , little Nell was not forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 76]: The light cart in which the Brigand usually made his perambulations being gaily dressed with flags and streamers , and the Brigand placed therein , contemplating the miniature of his beloved as usual , Nell was accommodated with a seat beside him , decorated with artificial flowers , and in this state and ceremony rode slowly through the town every morning , dispersing handbills from a basket , to the sound of drum and trumpet .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 24]: The beauty of the child , coupled with her gentle and timid bearing , produced quite a sensation in the little country place .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 38]: The Brigand , heretofore a source of exclusive interest in the streets , became a mere secondary consideration , and to be important only as a part of the show of which she was the chief attraction .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 40]: Grown-up folks began to be interested in the bright-eyed girl , and some score of little boys fell desperately in love , and constantly left enclosures of nuts and apples , directed in small-text , at the wax-work door .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 50]: This desirable impression was not lost on Mrs Jarley , who , lest Nell should become too cheap , soon sent the Brigand out alone again , and kept her in the exhibition room , where she described the figures every half-hour to the great satisfaction of admiring audiences .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 121]: And these audiences were of a very superior description , including a great many young ladies ' boarding-schools , whose favour Mrs Jarley had been at great pains to conciliate , by altering the face and costume of Mr Grimaldi as clown to represent Mr Lindley Murray as he appeared when engaged in the composition of his English Grammar , and turning a murderess of great renown into Mrs Hannah More -- both of which likenesses were admitted by Miss Monflathers , who was at the head of the head Boarding and Day Establishment in the town , and who condescended to take a Private View with eight chosen young ladies , to be quite startling from their extreme correctness .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 57]: Mr Pitt in a nightcap and bedgown , and without his boots , represented the poet Cowper with perfect exactness ; and Mary Queen of Scots in a dark wig , white shirt-collar , and male attire , was such a complete image of Lord Byron that the young ladies quite screamed when they saw it .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 54]: Miss Monflathers , however , rebuked this enthusiasm , and took occasion to reprove Mrs Jarley for not keeping her collection more select : observing that His Lordship had held certain opinions quite incompatible with wax-work honours , and adding something about a Dean and Chapter , which Mrs Jarley did not understand .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 87]: Although her duties were sufficiently laborious , Nell found in the lady of the caravan a very kind and considerate person , who had not only a peculiar relish for being comfortable herself , but for making everybody about her comfortable also ; which latter taste , it may be remarked , is , even in persons who live in much finer places than caravans , a far more rare and uncommon one than the first , and is not by any means its necessary consequence .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 66]: As her popularity procured her various little fees from the visitors on which her patroness never demanded any toll , and as her grandfather too was well-treated and useful , she had no cause of anxiety in connexion with the wax-work , beyond that which sprung from her recollection of Quilp , and her fears that he might return and one day suddenly encounter them .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 25]: Quilp indeed was a perpetual night-mare to the child , who was constantly haunted by a vision of his ugly face and stunted figure .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 81]: She slept , for their better security , in the room where the wax-work figures were , and she never retired to this place at night but she tortured herself -- she could not help it -- with imagining a resemblance , in some one or other of their death-like faces , to the dwarf , and this fancy would sometimes so gain upon her that she would almost believe he had removed the figure and stood within the clothes .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 95]: Then there were so many of them with their great glassy eyes -- and , as they stood one behind the other all about her bed , they looked so like living creatures , and yet so unlike in their grim stillness and silence , that she had a kind of terror of them for their own sakes , and would often lie watching their dusky figures until she was obliged to rise and light a candle , or go and sit at the open window and feel a companionship in the bright stars .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 50]: At these times , she would recall the old house and the window at which she used to sit alone ; and then she would think of poor Kit and all his kindness , until the tears came into her eyes , and she would weep and smile together .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 49]: Often and anxiously at this silent hour , her thoughts reverted to her grandfather , and she would wonder how much he remembered of their former life , and whether he was ever really mindful of the change in their condition and of their late helplessness and destitution .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 38]: When they were wandering about , she seldom thought of this , but now she could not help considering what would become of them if he fell sick , or her own strength were to fail her .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 76]: He was very patient and willing , happy to execute any little task , and glad to be of use ; but he was in the same listless state , with no prospect of improvement -- a mere child -- a poor , thoughtless , vacant creature -- a harmless fond old man , susceptible of tender love and regard for her , and of pleasant and painful impressions , but alive to nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 129]: It made her very sad to know that this was so -- so sad to see it that sometimes when he sat idly by , smiling and nodding to her when she looked round , or when he caressed some little child and carried it to and fro , as he was fond of doing by the hour together , perplexed by its simple questions , yet patient under his own infirmity , and seeming almost conscious of it too , and humbled even before the mind of an infant -- so sad it made her to see him thus , that she would burst into tears , and , withdrawing into some secret place , fall down upon her knees and pray that he might be restored .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 44]: But , the bitterness of her grief was not in beholding him in this condition , when he was at least content and tranquil , nor in her solitary meditations on his altered state , though these were trials for a young heart .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 11]: Cause for deeper and heavier sorrow was yet to come .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 18]: One evening , a holiday night with them , Nell and her grandfather went out to walk .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 22]: They had been rather closely confined for some days , and the weather being warm , they strolled a long distance .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 34]: Clear of the town , they took a footpath which struck through some pleasant fields , judging that it would terminate in the road they quitted and enable them to return that way .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 40]: It made , however , a much wider circuit than they had supposed , and thus they were tempted onward until sunset , when they reached the track of which they were in search , and stopped to rest .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 54]: It had been gradually getting overcast , and now the sky was dark and lowering , save where the glory of the departing sun piled up masses of gold and burning fire , decaying embers of which gleamed here and there through the black veil , and shone redly down upon the earth .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 35]: The wind began to moan in hollow murmurs , as the sun went down carrying glad day elsewhere ; and a train of dull clouds coming up against it , menaced thunder and lightning .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 33]: Large drops of rain soon began to fall , and , as the storm clouds came sailing onward , others supplied the void they left behind and spread over all the sky .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 30]: Then was heard the low rumbling of distant thunder , then the lightning quivered , and then the darkness of an hour seemed to have gathered in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 53]: Fearful of taking shelter beneath a tree or hedge , the old man and the child hurried along the high road , hoping to find some house in which they could seek a refuge from the storm , which had now burst forth in earnest , and every moment increased in violence .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 55]: Drenched with the pelting rain , confused by the deafening thunder , and bewildered by the glare of the forked lightning , they would have passed a solitary house without being aware of its vicinity , had not a man , who was standing at the door , called lustily to them to enter .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 50]: ` Your ears ought to be better than other folks ' at any rate , if you make so little of the chance of being struck blind , ' he said , retreating from the door and shading his eyes with his hands as the jagged lightning came again .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 11]: ` What were you going past for , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 20]: he added , as he closed the door and led the way along a passage to a room behind .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 20]: ` We did n't see the house , sir , till we heard you calling , ' Nell replied .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 20]: ` No wonder , ' said the man , ` with this lightning in one 's eyes , by-the-by .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 15]: You had better stand by the fire here , and dry yourselves a bit .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 12]: You can call for what you like if you want anything .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 16]: If you do n't want anything , you are not obliged to give an order .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 7]: Do n't be afraid of that .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 9]: This is a public-house , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 10]: The Valiant Soldier is pretty well known hereabouts . '
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 12]: ` Is this house called the Valiant Soldier , Sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 4]: asked Nell . '
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 11]: I thought everybody knew that , ' replied the landlord .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 22]: ` Where have you come from , if you do n't know the Valiant Soldier as well as the church catechism ?
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 33]: This is the Valiant Soldier , by James Groves -- Jem Groves -- honest Jem Groves , as is a man of unblemished moral character , and has a good dry skittle-ground .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 40]: If any man has got anything to say again Jem Groves , let him say it TO Jem Groves , and Jem Groves can accommodate him with a customer on any terms from four pound a side to forty .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 66]: With these words , the speaker tapped himself on the waistcoat to intimate that he was the Jem Groves so highly eulogized ; sparred scientifically at a counterfeit Jem Groves , who was sparring at society in general from a black frame over the chimney-piece ; and , applying a half-emptied glass of spirits and water to his lips , drank Jem Groves 's health .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 25]: The night being warm , there was a large screen drawn across the room , for a barrier against the heat of the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 59]: It seemed as if somebody on the other side of this screen had been insinuating doubts of Mr Groves 's prowess , and had thereby given rise to these egotistical expressions , for Mr Groves wound up his defiance by giving a loud knock upon it with his knuckles and pausing for a reply from the other side .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 31]: ` There a n't many men , ' said Mr Groves , no answer being returned , ` who would ventur ' to cross Jem Groves under his own roof .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 28]: There 's only one man , I know , that has nerve enough for that , and that man 's not a hundred mile from here neither .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 26]: But he 's worth a dozen men , and I let him say of me whatever he likes in consequence -- he knows that . '
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 25]: In return for this complimentary address , a very gruff hoarse voice bade Mr Groves ` hold his noise and light a candle . '
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 34]: And the same voice remarked that the same gentleman ` need n't waste his breath in brag , for most people knew pretty well what sort of stuff he was made of . '
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 20]: ` Nell , they 're -- they 're playing cards , ' whispered the old man , suddenly interested .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 8]: ` Do n't you hear them ? '
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 46]: ` Look sharp with that candle , ' said the voice ; ` it 's as much as I can do to see the pips on the cards as it is ; and get this shutter closed as quick as you can , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 13]: Your beer will be the worse for to-night 's thunder I expect .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 3]: -- Game !
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 7]: Seven-and-sixpence to me , old Isaac .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 4]: Hand over . '
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 13]: ` Do you hear , Nell , do you hear them ? '
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 19]: whispered the old man again , with increased earnestness , as the money chinked upon the table . '
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 47]: I have n't seen such a storm as this , ' said a sharp cracked voice of most disagreeable quality , when a tremendous peal of thunder had died away , ` since the night when old Luke Withers won thirteen times running on the red .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 47]: We all said he had the Devil 's luck and his own , and as it was the kind of night for the Devil to be out and busy , I suppose he was looking over his shoulder , if anybody could have seen him . '
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 34]: returned the gruff voice ; ` for all old Luke 's winning through thick and thin of late years , I remember the time when he was the unluckiest and unfortunatest of men .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 27]: He never took a dice-box in his hand , or held a card , but he was plucked , pigeoned , and cleaned out completely . '
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 9]: ` Do you hear what he says ? '
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 5]: whispered the old man .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 9]: ` Do you hear that , Nell ? '
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 17]: The child saw with astonishment and alarm that his whole appearance had undergone a complete change .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 41]: His face was flushed and eager , his eyes were strained , his teeth set , his breath came short and thick , and the hand he laid upon her arm trembled so violently that she shook beneath its grasp .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 40]: ` Bear witness , ' he muttered , looking upward , ` that I always said it ; that I knew it , dreamed of it , felt it was the truth , and that it must be so !
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 7]: What money have we , Nell ?
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 7]: I saw you with money yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 5]: What money have we ?
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 6]: Give it to me . '
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 18]: ` No , no , let me keep it , grandfather , ' said the frightened child .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 8]: ` Let us go away from here .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 6]: Do not mind the rain .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 6]: Pray let us go . '
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 16]: ` Give it to me , I say , ' returned the old man fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 11]: ` Hush , hush , do n't cry , Nell .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 13]: If I spoke sharply , dear , I did n't mean it .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 6]: It 's for thy good .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 18]: I have wronged thee , Nell , but I will right thee yet , I will indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 6]: Where is the money ? '
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 11]: ` Do not take it , ' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 9]: ` Pray do not take it , dear .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 29]: For both our sakes let me keep it , or let me throw it away -- better let me throw it away , than you take it now .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 10]: Let us go ; do let us go . '
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 18]: ` Give me the money , ' returned the old man , ' I must have it .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 10]: There -- there -- that 's my dear Nell .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 18]: I 'll right thee one day , child , I 'll right thee , never fear ! '
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 9]: She took from her pocket a little purse .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 27]: He seized it with the same rapid impatience which had characterised his speech , and hastily made his way to the other side of the screen .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 15]: It was impossible to restrain him , and the trembling child followed close behind .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 21]: The landlord had placed a light upon the table , and was engaged in drawing the curtain of the window .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 38]: The speakers whom they had heard were two men , who had a pack of cards and some silver money between them , while upon the screen itself the games they had played were scored in chalk .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 49]: The man with the rough voice was a burly fellow of middle age , with large black whiskers , broad cheeks , a coarse wide mouth , and bull neck , which was pretty freely displayed as his shirt collar was only confined by a loose red neckerchief .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 20]: He wore his hat , which was of a brownish-white , and had beside him a thick knotted stick .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 40]: The other man , whom his companion had called Isaac , was of a more slender figure -- stooping , and high in the shoulders -- with a very ill-favoured face , and a most sinister and villainous squint .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 12]: ` Now old gentleman , ' said Isaac , looking round .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 8]: ` Do you know either of us ?
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 11]: This side of the screen is private , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 13]: ` No offence , I hope , ' returned the old man .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 37]: ` But by G -- , sir , there is offence , ' said the other , interrupting him , ` when you intrude yourself upon a couple of gentlemen who are particularly engaged . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 20]: I had no intention to offend , ' said the old man , looking anxiously at the cards . '
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 21]: I thought that -- ' ` But you had no right to think , sir , ' retorted the other .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 18]: ` What the devil has a man at your time of life to do with thinking ? '
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 31]: ` Now bully boy , ' said the stout man , raising his eyes from his cards for the first time , ` ca n't you let him speak ? '
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 48]: The landlord , who had apparently resolved to remain neutral until he knew which side of the question the stout man would espouse , chimed in at this place with ` Ah , to be sure , ca n't you let him speak , Isaac List ? '
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 32]: ` Ca n't I let him speak , ' sneered Isaac in reply , mimicking as nearly as he could , in his shrill voice , the tones of the landlord .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 13]: ` Yes , I can let him speak , Jemmy Groves . '
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 11]: ` Well then , do it , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 4]: said the landlord .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 40]: Mr List 's squint assumed a portentous character , which seemed to threaten a prolongation of this controversy , when his companion , who had been looking sharply at the old man , put a timely stop to it .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 38]: ` Who knows , ' said he , with a cunning look , ` but the gentleman may have civilly meant to ask if he might have the honour to take a hand with us ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 11]: I did mean it , ' cried the old man .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 7]: ` That is what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 9]: That is what I want now ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 10]: I thought so , ' returned the same man .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 24]: ` Then who knows but the gentleman , anticipating our objection to play for love , civilly desired to play for money ? '
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 36]: The old man replied by shaking the little purse in his eager hand , and then throwing it down upon the table , and gathering up the cards as a miser would clutch at gold .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 23]: That indeed , ' said Isaac ; ` if that 's what the gentleman meant , I beg the gentleman 's pardon .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 8]: Is this the gentleman 's little purse ?
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 6]: A very pretty little purse .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 34]: Rather a light purse , ' added Isaac , throwing it into the air and catching it dexterously , ` but enough to amuse a gentleman for half an hour or so . '
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 21]: ` We 'll make a four-handed game of it , and take in Groves , ' said the stout man .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 6]: ` Come , Jemmy . '
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 25]: The landlord , who conducted himself like one who was well used to such little parties , approached the table and took his seat .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 24]: The child , in a perfect agony , drew her grandfather aside , and implored him , even then , to come away .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 15]: ` Come ; and we may be so happy , ' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 13]: ` We WILL be happy , ' replied the old man hastily .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 7]: ` Let me go , Nell .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 12]: The means of happiness are on the cards and the dice .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 9]: We must rise from little winnings to great .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 15]: There 's little to be won here ; but great will come in time .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 19]: I shall but win back my own , and it 's all for thee , my darling . '
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 6]: ` God help us ! '
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 4]: cried the child .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 8]: what hard fortune brought us here ? '
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 18]: rejoined the old man laying his hand upon her mouth , ` Fortune will not bear chiding .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 18]: We must not reproach her , or she shuns us ; I have found that out . '
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 11]: ` Now , mister , ' said the stout man .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 18]: ` If you 're not coming yourself , give us the cards , will you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 10]: I am coming , ' cried the old man .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 14]: ` Sit thee down , Nell , sit thee down and look on .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 16]: Be of good heart , it 's all for thee -- all -- every penny .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 28]: I do n't tell them , no , no , or else they would n't play , dreading the chance that such a cause must give me .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 4]: Look at them .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 9]: See what they are and what thou art .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 8]: Who doubts that we must win ! '
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 28]: ` The gentleman has thought better of it , and is n't coming , ' said Isaac , making as though he would rise from the table .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 22]: ` I 'm sorry the gentleman 's daunted -- nothing venture , nothing have -- but the gentleman knows best . '
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 6]: ` Why I am ready .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 15]: You have all been slow but me , ' said the old man . '
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 38]: I wonder who is more anxious to begin than I. ' As he spoke he drew a chair to the table ; and the other three closing round it at the same time , the game commenced .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 14]: The child sat by , and watched its progress with a troubled mind .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 30]: Regardless of the run of luck , and mindful only of the desperate passion which had its hold upon her grandfather , losses and gains were to her alike .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 50]: Exulting in some brief triumph , or cast down by a defeat , there he sat so wild and restless , so feverishly and intensely anxious , so terribly eager , so ravenous for the paltry stakes , that she could have almost better borne to see him dead .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 37]: And yet she was the innocent cause of all this torture , and he , gambling with such a savage thirst for gain as the most insatiable gambler never felt , had not one selfish thought !
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 38]: On the contrary , the other three -- knaves and gamesters by their trade -- while intent upon their game , were yet as cool and quiet as if every virtue had been centered in their breasts .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 99]: Sometimes one would look up to smile to another , or to snuff the feeble candle , or to glance at the lightning as it shot through the open window and fluttering curtain , or to listen to some louder peal of thunder than the rest , with a kind of momentary impatience , as if it put him out ; but there they sat , with a calm indifference to everything but their cards , perfect philosophers in appearance , and with no greater show of passion or excitement than if they had been made of stone .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 57]: The storm had raged for full three hours ; the lightning had grown fainter and less frequent ; the thunder , from seeming to roll and break above their heads , had gradually died away into a deep hoarse distance ; and still the game went on , and still the anxious child was quite forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 20]: Chapter 30 At length the play came to an end , and Mr Isaac List rose the only winner .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 11]: Mat and the landlord bore their losses with professional fortitude .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 30]: Isaac pocketed his gains with the air of a man who had quite made up his mind to win , all along , and was neither surprised nor pleased .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 66]: Nell 's little purse was exhausted ; but although it lay empty by his side , and the other players had now risen from the table , the old man sat poring over the cards , dealing them as they had been dealt before , and turning up the different hands to see what each man would have held if they had still been playing .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 28]: He was quite absorbed in this occupation , when the child drew near and laid her hand upon his shoulder , telling him it was near midnight .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 25]: ` See the curse of poverty , Nell , ' he said , pointing to the packs he had spread out upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 25]: ` If I could have gone on a little longer , only a little longer , the luck would have turned on my side .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 13]: Yes , it 's as plain as the marks upon the cards .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 11]: See here -- and there -- and here again . '
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 10]: ` Put them away , ' urged the child .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 7]: ` Try to forget them . '
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 7]: ` Try to forget them ! '
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 18]: he rejoined , raising his haggard face to hers , and regarding her with an incredulous stare .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 5]: ` To forget them !
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 13]: How are we ever to grow rich if I forget them ? '
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 8]: The child could only shake her head .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 24]: ` No , no , Nell , ' said the old man , patting her cheek ; ` they must not be forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 12]: We must make amends for this as soon as we can .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 15]: Patience -- patience , and we 'll right thee yet , I promise thee .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 6]: Lose to-day , win to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 12]: And nothing can be won without anxiety and care -- nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 7]: Come , I am ready . '
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 10]: ` Do you know what the time is ? '
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 11]: said Mr Groves , who was smoking with his friends .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 19]: ` Past twelve o'clock -- ' ' -- And a rainy night , ' added the stout man .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 9]: ` The Valiant Soldier , by James Groves .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 3]: Good beds .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 16]: Cheap entertainment for man and beast , ' said Mr Groves , quoting his sign-board .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 6]: ` Half-past twelve o'clock . '
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 13]: ` It 's very late , ' said the uneasy child . '
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 7]: I wish we had gone before .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 7]: What will they think of us !
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 12]: It will be two o'clock by the time we get back .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 13]: What would it cost , sir , if we stopped here ? '
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 25]: ` Two good beds , one-and-sixpence ; supper and beer one shilling ; total two shillings and sixpence , ' replied the Valiant Soldier .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 130]: Now , Nell had still the piece of gold sewn in her dress ; and when she came to consider the lateness of the hour , and the somnolent habits of Mrs Jarley , and to imagine the state of consternation in which they would certainly throw that good lady by knocking her up in the middle of the night -- and when she reflected , on the other hand , that if they remained where they were , and rose early in the morning , they might get back before she awoke , and could plead the violence of the storm by which they had been overtaken , as a good apology for their absence -- she decided , after a great deal of hesitation , to remain .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 34]: She therefore took her grandfather aside , and telling him that she had still enough left to defray the cost of their lodging , proposed that they should stay there for the night .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 23]: ` If I had had but that money before -- If I had only known of it a few minutes ago ! '
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 5]: muttered the old man .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 22]: ` We will decide to stop here if you please , ' said Nell , turning hastily to the landlord . '
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 11]: I think that 's prudent , ' returned Mr Groves .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 9]: ` You shall have your suppers directly . '
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 64]: Accordingly , when Mr Groves had smoked his pipe out , knocked out the ashes , and placed it carefully in a corner of the fire-place , with the bowl downwards , he brought in the bread and cheese , and beer , with many high encomiums upon their excellence , and bade his guests fall to , and make themselves at home .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 39]: Nell and her grandfather ate sparingly , for both were occupied with their own reflections ; the other gentlemen , for whose constitutions beer was too weak and tame a liquid , consoled themselves with spirits and tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 27]: As they would leave the house very early in the morning , the child was anxious to pay for their entertainment before they retired to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 60]: But as she felt the necessity of concealing her little hoard from her grandfather , and had to change the piece of gold , she took it secretly from its place of concealment , and embraced an opportunity of following the landlord when he went out of the room , and tendered it to him in the little bar .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 14]: ` Will you give me the change here , if you please ? '
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 4]: said the child .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 43]: Mr James Groves was evidently surprised , and looked at the money , and rang it , and looked at the child , and at the money again , as though he had a mind to inquire how she came by it .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 30]: The coin being genuine , however , and changed at his house , he probably felt , like a wise landlord , that it was no business of his .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 15]: At any rate , he counted out the change , and gave it her .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 28]: The child was returning to the room where they had passed the evening , when she fancied she saw a figure just gliding in at the door .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 49]: There was nothing but a long dark passage between this door and the place where she had changed the money , and , being very certain that no person had passed in or out while she stood there , the thought struck her that she had been watched .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 4]: But by whom ?
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 17]: When she re-entered the room , she found its inmates exactly as she had left them .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 32]: The stout fellow lay upon two chairs , resting his head on his hand , and the squinting man reposed in a similar attitude on the opposite side of the table .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 31]: Between them sat her grandfather , looking intently at the winner with a kind of hungry admiration , and hanging upon his words as if he were some superior being .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 18]: She was puzzled for a moment , and looked round to see if any else were there .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 19]: Then she asked her grandfather in a whisper whether anybody had left the room while she was absent .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 11]: ` No , ' he said , ` nobody . '
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 37]: It must have been her fancy then ; and yet it was strange , that , without anything in her previous thoughts to lead to it , she should have imagined this figure so very distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 19]: She was still wondering and thinking of it , when a girl came to light her to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 20]: The old man took leave of the company at the same time , and they went up stairs together .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 24]: It was a great , rambling house , with dull corridors and wide staircases which the flaring candles seemed to make more gloomy .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 32]: She left her grandfather in his chamber , and followed her guide to another , which was at the end of a passage , and approached by some half-dozen crazy steps .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 6]: This was prepared for her .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 14]: The girl lingered a little while to talk , and tell her grievances .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 21]: She had not a good place , she said ; the wages were low , and the work was hard .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 22]: She was going to leave it in a fortnight ; the child could n't recommend her to another , she supposed ?
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 34]: Instead she was afraid another would be difficult to get after living there , for the house had a very indifferent character ; there was far too much card-playing , and such like .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 40]: She was very much mistaken if some of the people who came there oftenest were quite as honest as they might be , but she would n't have it known that she had said so , for the world .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 38]: Then there were some rambling allusions to a rejected sweetheart , who had threatened to go a soldiering -- a final promise of knocking at the door early in the morning -- and ` Good night . '
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 12]: The child did not feel comfortable when she was left alone .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 28]: She could not help thinking of the figure stealing through the passage down stairs ; and what the girl had said did not tend to reassure her .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 6]: The men were very ill-looking .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 11]: They might get their living by robbing and murdering travellers .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 4]: Who could tell ?
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 31]: Reasoning herself out of these fears , or losing sight of them for a little while , there came the anxiety to which the adventures of the night gave rise .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 26]: Here was the old passion awakened again in her grandfather 's breast , and to what further distraction it might tempt him Heaven only knew .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 9]: What fears their absence might have occasioned already !
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 9]: Persons might be seeking for them even then .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 13]: Would they be forgiven in the morning , or turned adrift again !
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 9]: why had they stopped in that strange place ?
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 15]: It would have been better , under any circumstances , to have gone on !
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 34]: At last , sleep gradually stole upon her -- a broken , fitful sleep , troubled by dreams of falling from high towers , and waking with a start and in great terror .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 11]: A deeper slumber followed this -- and then -- What !
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 6]: That figure in the room .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 5]: A figure was there .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 51]: Yes , she had drawn up the blind to admit the light when it should be dawn , and there , between the foot of the bed and the dark casement , it crouched and slunk along , groping its way with noiseless hands , and stealing round the bed .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 21]: She had no voice to cry for help , no power to move , but lay still , watching it .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 16]: On it came -- on , silently and stealthily , to the bed 's head .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 24]: The breath so near her pillow , that she shrunk back into it , lest those wandering hands should light upon her face .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 15]: Back again it stole to the window -- then turned its head towards her .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 37]: The dark form was a mere blot upon the lighter darkness of the room , but she saw the turning of the head , and felt and knew how the eyes looked and the ears listened .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 8]: There it remained , motionless as she .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 25]: At length , still keeping the face towards her , it busied its hands in something , and she heard the chink of money .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 35]: Then , on it came again , silent and stealthy as before , and replacing the garments it had taken from the bedside , dropped upon its hands and knees , and crawled away .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 22]: How slowly it seemed to move , now that she could hear but not see it , creeping along the floor !
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 13]: It reached the door at last , and stood upon its feet .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 13]: The steps creaked beneath its noiseless tread , and it was gone .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 40]: The first impulse of the child was to fly from the terror of being by herself in that room -- to have somebody by -- not to be alone -- and then her power of speech would be restored .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 12]: With no consciousness of having moved , she gained the door .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 14]: There was the dreadful shadow , pausing at the bottom of the steps .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 29]: She could not pass it ; she might have done so , perhaps , in the darkness without being seized , but her blood curdled at the thought .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 32]: The figure stood quite still , and so did she ; not boldly , but of necessity ; for going back into the room was hardly less terrible than going on .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 19]: The rain beat fast and furiously without , and ran down in plashing streams from the thatched roof .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 34]: Some summer insect , with no escape into the air , flew blindly to and fro , beating its body against the walls and ceiling , and filling the silent place with murmurs .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 5]: The figure moved again .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 7]: The child involuntarily did the same .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 12]: Once in her grandfather 's room , she would be safe .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 19]: It crept along the passage until it came to the very door she longed so ardently to reach .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 35]: The child , in the agony of being so near , had almost darted forward with the design of bursting into the room and closing it behind her , when the figure stopped again .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 24]: The idea flashed suddenly upon her -- what if it entered there , and had a design upon the old man 's life !
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 6]: She turned faint and sick .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 3]: It did .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 4]: It went in .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 6]: There was a light inside .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 25]: The figure was now within the chamber , and she , still dumb -- quite dumb , and almost senseless -- stood looking on .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 6]: The door was partly open .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 25]: Not knowing what she meant to do , but meaning to preserve him or be killed herself , she staggered forward and looked in .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 9]: What sight was that which met her view !
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 14]: The bed had not been lain on , but was smooth and empty .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 43]: And at a table sat the old man himself ; the only living creature there ; his white face pinched and sharpened by the greediness which made his eyes unnaturally bright -- counting the money of which his hands had robbed her .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 35]: Chapter 31 With steps more faltering and unsteady than those with which she had approached the room , the child withdrew from the door , and groped her way back to her own chamber .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 16]: The terror she had lately felt was nothing compared with that which now oppressed her .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 54]: No strange robber , no treacherous host conniving at the plunder of his guests , or stealing to their beds to kill them in their sleep , no nightly prowler , however terrible and cruel , could have awakened in her bosom half the dread which the recognition of her silent visitor inspired .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 67]: The grey-headed old man gliding like a ghost into her room and acting the thief while he supposed her fast asleep , then bearing off his prize and hanging over it with the ghastly exultation she had witnessed , was worse -- immeasurably worse , and far more dreadful , for the moment , to reflect upon -- than anything her wildest fancy could have suggested .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 80]: If he should return -- there was no lock or bolt upon the door , and if , distrustful of having left some money yet behind , he should come back to seek for more -- a vague awe and horror surrounded the idea of his slinking in again with stealthy tread , and turning his face toward the empty bed , while she shrank down close at his feet to avoid his touch , which was almost insupportable .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 5]: She sat and listened .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 2]: Hark !
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 14]: A footstep on the stairs , and now the door was slowly opening .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 47]: It was but imagination , yet imagination had all the terrors of reality ; nay , it was worse , for the reality would have come and gone , and there an end , but in imagination it was always coming , and never went away .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 13]: The feeling which beset the child was one of dim uncertain horror .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 100]: She had no fear of the dear old grandfather , in whose love for her this disease of the brain had been engendered ; but the man she had seen that night , wrapt in the game of chance , lurking in her room , and counting the money by the glimmering light , seemed like another creature in his shape , a monstrous distortion of his image , a something to recoil from , and be the more afraid of , because it bore a likeness to him , and kept close about her , as he did .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 26]: She could scarcely connect her own affectionate companion , save by his loss , with this old man , so like yet so unlike him .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 10]: She had wept to see him dull and quiet .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 10]: How much greater cause she had for weeping now !
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 63]: The child sat watching and thinking of these things , until the phantom in her mind so increased in gloom and terror , that she felt it would be a relief to hear the old man 's voice , or , if he were asleep , even to see him , and banish some of the fears that clustered round his image .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 9]: She stole down the stairs and passage again .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 18]: The door was still ajar as she had left it , and the candle burning as before .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 38]: She had her own candle in her hand , prepared to say , if he were waking , that she was uneasy and could not rest , and had come to see if his were still alight .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 21]: Looking into the room , she saw him lying calmly on his bed , and so took courage to enter .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 3]: Fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 25]: No passion in the face , no avarice , no anxiety , no wild desire ; all gentle , tranquil , and at peace .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 53]: This was not the gambler , or the shadow in her room ; this was not even the worn and jaded man whose face had so often met her own in the grey morning light ; this was her dear old friend , her harmless fellow-traveller , her good , kind grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 29]: She had no fear as she looked upon his slumbering features , but she had a deep and weighty sorrow , and it found its relief in tears .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 6]: ` God bless him ! '
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 13]: said the child , stooping softly to kiss his placid cheek . '
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 31]: I see too well now , that they would indeed part us if they found us out , and shut him up from the light of the sun and sky .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 8]: He has only me to help him .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 6]: God bless us both ! '
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 36]: Lighting her candle , she retreated as silently as she had come , and , gaining her own room once more , sat up during the remainder of that long , long , miserable night .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 15]: At last the day turned her waning candle pale , and she fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 32]: She was quickly roused by the girl who had shown her up to bed ; and , as soon as she was dressed , prepared to go down to her grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 20]: But first she searched her pocket and found that her money was all gone -- not a sixpence remained .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 17]: The old man was ready , and in a few seconds they were on their road .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 22]: The child thought he rather avoided her eye , and appeared to expect that she would tell him of her loss .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 14]: She felt she must do that , or he might suspect the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 35]: ` Grandfather , ' she said in a tremulous voice , after they had walked about a mile in silence , ` do you think they are honest people at the house yonder ? '
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 4]: ` Why ? '
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 6]: returned the old man trembling .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 14]: ` Do I think them honest -- yes , they played honestly . '
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 14]: ` I 'll tell you why I ask , ' rejoined Nell . '
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 16]: I lost some money last night -- out of my bedroom , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 39]: Unless it was taken by somebody in jest -- only in jest , dear grandfather , which would make me laugh heartily if I could but know it -- ' ` Who would take money in jest ? '
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 9]: returned the old man in a hurried manner .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 11]: ` Those who take money , take it to keep .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 7]: Do n't talk of jest . '
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 29]: ` Then it was stolen out of my room , dear , ' said the child , whose last hope was destroyed by the manner of this reply .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 10]: ` But is there no more , Nell ? '
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 10]: said the old man ; ` no more anywhere ?
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 16]: Was it all taken -- every farthing of it -- was there nothing left ? '
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 8]: ` Nothing , ' replied the child .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 33]: ` We must get more , ' said the old man , ` we must earn it , Nell , hoard it up , scrape it together , come by it somehow .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 5]: Never mind this loss .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 12]: Tell nobody of it , and perhaps we may regain it .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 29]: Do n't ask how ; -- we may regain it , and a great deal more ; -- but tell nobody , or trouble may come of it .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 16]: And so they took it out of thy room , when thou wert asleep ! '
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 23]: he added in a compassionate tone , very different from the secret , cunning way in which he had spoken until now .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 9]: ` Poor Nell , poor little Nell ! '
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 9]: The child hung down her head and wept .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 18]: The sympathising tone in which he spoke , was quite sincere ; she was sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 18]: It was not the lightest part of her sorrow to know that this was done for her .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 39]: ` Not a word about it to any one but me , ' said the old man , ` no , not even to me , ' he added hastily , ` for it can do no good .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 17]: All the losses that ever were , are not worth tears from thy eyes , darling .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 13]: Why should they be , when we will win them back ? '
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 12]: ` Let them go , ' said the child looking up .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 27]: ` Let them go , once and for ever , and I would never shed another tear if every penny had been a thousand pounds . '
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 28]: ` Well , well , ' returned the old man , checking himself as some impetuous answer rose to his lips , ` she knows no better .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 9]: I ought to be thankful of it . '
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 20]: ` But listen to me , ' said the child earnestly , ` will you listen to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 26]: ` Aye , aye , I 'll listen , ' returned the old man , still without looking at her ; ' a pretty voice .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 9]: It has always a sweet sound to me .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 14]: It always had when it was her mother 's , poor child . '
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 44]: ` Let me persuade you , then -- oh , do let me persuade you , ' said the child , ` to think no more of gains or losses , and to try no fortune but the fortune we pursue together . '
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 22]: ` We pursue this aim together , ' retorted her grandfather , still looking away and seeming to confer with himself .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 8]: ` Whose image sanctifies the game ? '
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 27]: ` Have we been worse off , ' resumed the child , ` since you forgot these cares , and we have been travelling on together ?
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 32]: Have we not been much better and happier without a home to shelter us , than ever we were in that unhappy house , when they were on your mind ? '
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 18]: ` She speaks the truth , ' murmured the old man in the same tone as before .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 19]: ` It must not turn me , but it is the truth ; no doubt it is . '
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 67]: ` Only remember what we have been since that bright morning when we turned our backs upon it for the last time , ' said Nell , ` only remember what we have been since we have been free of all those miseries -- what peaceful days and quiet nights we have had -- what pleasant times we have known -- what happiness we have enjoyed .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 21]: If we have been tired or hungry , we have been soon refreshed , and slept the sounder for it .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 15]: Think what beautiful things we have seen , and how contented we have felt .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 8]: And why was this blessed change ? '
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 26]: He stopped her with a motion of his hand , and bade her talk to him no more just then , for he was busy .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 48]: After a time he kissed her cheek , still motioning her to silence , and walked on , looking far before him , and sometimes stopping and gazing with a puckered brow upon the ground , as if he were painfully trying to collect his disordered thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 8]: Once she saw tears in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 69]: When he had gone on thus for some time , he took her hand in his as he was accustomed to do , with nothing of the violence or animation of his late manner ; and so , by degrees so fine that the child could not trace them , he settled down into his usual quiet way , and suffered her to lead him where she would .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 89]: When they presented themselves in the midst of the stupendous collection , they found , as Nell had anticipated , that Mrs Jarley was not yet out of bed , and that , although she had suffered some uneasiness on their account overnight , and had indeed sat up for them until past eleven o'clock , she had retired in the persuasion , that , being overtaken by storm at some distance from home , they had sought the nearest shelter , and would not return before morning .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 42]: Nell immediately applied herself with great assiduity to the decoration and preparation of the room , and had the satisfaction of completing her task , and dressing herself neatly , before the beloved of the Royal Family came down to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 63]: ` We have n't had , ' said Mrs Jarley when the meal was over , ` more than eight of Miss Monflathers 's young ladies all the time we 've been here , and there 's twenty-six of 'em , as I was told by the cook when I asked her a question or two and put her on the free-list .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 30]: We must try 'em with a parcel of new bills , and you shall take it , my dear , and see what effect that has upon 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 72]: The proposed expedition being one of paramount importance , Mrs Jarley adjusted Nell 's bonnet with her own hands , and declaring that she certainly did look very pretty , and reflected credit on the establishment , dismissed her with many commendations , and certain needful directions as to the turnings on the right which she was to take , and the turnings on the left which she was to avoid .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 84]: Thus instructed , Nell had no difficulty in finding out Miss Monflathers 's Boarding and Day Establishment , which was a large house , with a high wall , and a large garden-gate with a large brass plate , and a small grating through which Miss Monflathers 's parlour-maid inspected all visitors before admitting them ; for nothing in the shape of a man -- no , not even a milkman -- was suffered , without special license , to pass that gate .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 24]: Even the tax-gatherer , who was stout , and wore spectacles and a broad-brimmed hat , had the taxes handed through the grating .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 20]: More obdurate than gate of adamant or brass , this gate of Miss Monflathers 's frowned on all mankind .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 21]: The very butcher respected it as a gate of mystery , and left off whistling when he rang the bell .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 53]: As Nell approached the awful door , it turned slowly upon its hinges with a creaking noise , and , forth from the solemn grove beyond , came a long file of young ladies , two and two , all with open books in their hands , and some with parasols likewise .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 38]: And last of the goodly procession came Miss Monflathers , bearing herself a parasol of lilac silk , and supported by two smiling teachers , each mortally envious of the other , and devoted unto Miss Monflathers .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 56]: Confused by the looks and whispers of the girls , Nell stood with downcast eyes and suffered the procession to pass on , until Miss Monflathers , bringing up the rear , approached her , when she curtseyed and presented her little packet ; on receipt whereof Miss Monflathers commanded that the line should halt .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 12]: ` You 're the wax-work child , are you not ? '
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 4]: said Miss Monflathers .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 33]: ` Yes , ma'am , ' replied Nell , colouring deeply , for the young ladies had collected about her , and she was the centre on which all eyes were fixed .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 54]: ` And do n't you think you must be a very wicked little child , ' said Miss Monflathers , who was of rather uncertain temper , and lost no opportunity of impressing moral truths upon the tender minds of the young ladies , ` to be a wax-work child at all ? '
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 27]: Poor Nell had never viewed her position in this light , and not knowing what to say , remained silent , blushing more deeply than before .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 50]: ` Do n't you know , ' said Miss Monflathers , ` that it 's very naughty and unfeminine , and a perversion of the properties wisely and benignantly transmitted to us , with expansive powers to be roused from their dormant state through the medium of cultivation ? '
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 32]: The two teachers murmured their respectful approval of this home-thrust , and looked at Nell as though they would have said that there indeed Miss Monflathers had hit her very hard .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 57]: Then they smiled and glanced at Miss Monflathers , and then , their eyes meeting , they exchanged looks which plainly said that each considered herself smiler in ordinary to Miss Monflathers , and regarded the other as having no right to smile , and that her so doing was an act of presumption and impertinence .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 77]: ` Do n't you feel how naughty it is of you , ' resumed Miss Monflathers , ` to be a wax-work child , when you might have the proud consciousness of assisting , to the extent of your infant powers , the manufactures of your country ; of improving your mind by the constant contemplation of the steam-engine ; and of earning a comfortable and independent subsistence of from two-and-ninepence to three shillings per week ?
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 19]: Do n't you know that the harder you are at work , the happier you are ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 20]: `` How doth the little -- '' ' murmured one of the teachers , in quotation from Doctor Watts .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 4]: ` Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 8]: said Miss Monflathers , turning smartly round .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 6]: ` Who said that ? '
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 38]: Of course the teacher who had not said it , indicated the rival who had , whom Miss Monflathers frowningly requested to hold her peace ; by that means throwing the informing teacher into raptures of joy .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 23]: ` The little busy bee , ' said Miss Monflathers , drawing herself up , ` is applicable only to genteel children .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 35]: `` In books , or work , or healthful play '' is quite right as far as they are concerned ; and the work means painting on velvet , fancy needle-work , or embroidery .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 41]: In such cases as these , ' pointing to Nell , with her parasol , ` and in the case of all poor people 's children , we should read it thus : `` In work , work , work .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 25]: In work alway Let my first years be past , That I may give for ev'ry day Some good account at last . '' '
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 54]: A deep hum of applause rose not only from the two teachers , but from all the pupils , who were equally astonished to hear Miss Monflathers improvising after this brilliant style ; for although she had been long known as a politician , she had never appeared before as an original poet .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 20]: Just then somebody happened to discover that Nell was crying , and all eyes were again turned towards her .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 25]: There were indeed tears in her eyes , and drawing out her handkerchief to brush them away , she happened to let it fall .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 48]: Before she could stoop to pick it up , one young lady of about fifteen or sixteen , who had been standing a little apart from the others , as though she had no recognised place among them , sprang forward and put it in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 15]: She was gliding timidly away again , when she was arrested by the governess .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 18]: ` It was Miss Edwards who did that , I KNOW , ' said Miss Monflathers predictively .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 11]: ` Now I am sure that was Miss Edwards . '
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 22]: It was Miss Edwards , and everybody said it was Miss Edwards , and Miss Edwards herself admitted that it was .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 92]: ` Is it not , ' said Miss Monflathers , putting down her parasol to take a severer view of the offender , ' a most remarkable thing , Miss Edwards , that you have an attachment to the lower classes which always draws you to their sides ; or , rather , is it not a most extraordinary thing that all I say and do will not wean you from propensities which your original station in life have unhappily rendered habitual to you , you extremely vulgar-minded girl ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 14]: I really intended no harm , ma'am , ' said a sweet voice .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 10]: ` It was a momentary impulse , indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 5]: ` An impulse ! '
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 6]: repeated Miss Monflathers scornfully . '
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 64]: I wonder that you presume to speak of impulses to me ' -- both the teachers assented -- ' I am astonished ' -- both the teachers were astonished -- ' I suppose it is an impulse which induces you to take the part of every grovelling and debased person that comes in your way ' -- both the teachers supposed so too .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 77]: ` But I would have you know , Miss Edwards , ' resumed the governess in a tone of increased severity , ` that you can not be permitted -- if it be only for the sake of preserving a proper example and decorum in this establishment -- that you can not be permitted , and that you shall not be permitted , to fly in the face of your superiors in this exceedingly gross manner .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 40]: If you have no reason to feel a becoming pride before wax-work children , there are young ladies here who have , and you must either defer to those young ladies or leave the establishment , Miss Edwards . '
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 56]: This young lady , being motherless and poor , was apprenticed at the school -- taught for nothing -- teaching others what she learnt , for nothing -- boarded for nothing -- lodged for nothing -- and set down and rated as something immeasurably less than nothing , by all the dwellers in the house .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 28]: The servant-maids felt her inferiority , for they were better treated ; free to come and go , and regarded in their stations with much more respect .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 23]: The teachers were infinitely superior , for they had paid to go to school in their time , and were paid now .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 64]: The pupils cared little for a companion who had no grand stories to tell about home ; no friends to come with post-horses , and be received in all humility , with cake and wine , by the governess ; no deferential servant to attend and bear her home for the holidays ; nothing genteel to talk about , and nothing to display .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 21]: But why was Miss Monflathers always vexed and irritated with the poor apprentice -- how did that come to pass ?
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 77]: Why , the gayest feather in Miss Monflathers 's cap , and the brightest glory of Miss Monflathers 's school , was a baronet 's daughter -- the real live daughter of a real live baronet -- who , by some extraordinary reversal of the Laws of Nature , was not only plain in features but dull in intellect , while the poor apprentice had both a ready wit , and a handsome face and figure .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 4]: It seems incredible .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 70]: Here was Miss Edwards , who only paid a small premium which had been spent long ago , every day outshining and excelling the baronet 's daughter , who learned all the extras -LRB- or was taught them all -RRB- and whose half-yearly bill came to double that of any other young lady 's in the school , making no account of the honour and reputation of her pupilage .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 52]: Therefore , and because she was a dependent , Miss Monflathers had a great dislike to Miss Edwards , and was spiteful to her , and aggravated by her , and , when she had compassion on little Nell , verbally fell upon and maltreated her as we have already seen .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 17]: ` You will not take the air to-day , Miss Edwards , ' said Miss Monflathers .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 20]: ` Have the goodness to retire to your own room , and not to leave it without permission . '
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 29]: The poor girl was moving hastily away , when she was suddenly , in nautical phrase , ` brought to ' by a subdued shriek from Miss Monflathers .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 10]: ` She has passed me without any salute ! '
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 11]: cried the governess , raising her eyes to the sky .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 15]: ` She has actually passed me without the slightest acknowledgment of my presence ! '
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 7]: The young lady turned and curtsied .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 44]: Nell could see that she raised her dark eyes to the face of her superior , and that their expression , and that of her whole attitude for the instant , was one of mute but most touching appeal against this ungenerous usage .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 19]: Miss Monflathers only tossed her head in reply , and the great gate closed upon a bursting heart .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 83]: ` As for you , you wicked child , ' said Miss Monflathers , turning to Nell , ` tell your mistress that if she presumes to take the liberty of sending to me any more , I will write to the legislative authorities and have her put in the stocks , or compelled to do penance in a white sheet ; and you may depend upon it that you shall certainly experience the treadmill if you dare to come here again .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 6]: Now ladies , on . '
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 75]: The procession filed off , two and two , with the books and parasols , and Miss Monflathers , calling the Baronet 's daughter to walk with her and smooth her ruffled feelings , discarded the two teachers -- who by this time had exchanged their smiles for looks of sympathy -- and left them to bring up the rear , and hate each other a little more for being obliged to walk together .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 26]: Chapter 32 Mrs Jarley 's wrath on first learning that she had been threatened with the indignity of Stocks and Penance , passed all description .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 19]: The genuine and only Jarley exposed to public scorn , jeered by children , and flouted by beadles !
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 35]: The delight of the Nobility and Gentry shorn of a bonnet which a Lady Mayoress might have sighed to wear , and arrayed in a white sheet as a spectacle of mortification and humility !
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 68]: And Miss Monflathers , the audacious creature who presumed , even in the dimmest and remotest distance of her imagination , to conjure up the degrading picture , ' I am a ` most inclined , ' said Mrs Jarley , bursting with the fulness of her anger and the weakness of her means of revenge , ` to turn atheist when I think of it ! '
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 65]: But instead of adopting this course of retaliation , Mrs Jarley , on second thoughts , brought out the suspicious bottle , and ordering glasses to be set forth upon her favourite drum , and sinking into a chair behind it , called her satellites about her , and to them several times recounted , word for word , the affronts she had received .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 90]: This done , she begged them in a kind of deep despair to drink ; then laughed , then cried , then took a little sip herself , then laughed and cried again , and took a little more ; and so , by degrees , the worthy lady went on , increasing in smiles and decreasing in tears , until at last she could not laugh enough at Miss Monflathers , who , from being an object of dire vexation , became one of sheer ridicule and absurdity .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 22]: ` For which of us is best off , I wonder , ' quoth Mrs Jarley , ` she or me !
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 44]: It 's only talking , when all is said and done , and if she talks of me in the stocks , why I can talk of her in the stocks , which is a good deal funnier if we come to that .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 11]: Lord , what does it matter , after all ! '
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 67]: Having arrived at this comfortable frame of mind -LRB- to which she had been greatly assisted by certain short interjectional remarks of the philosophical George -RRB- , Mrs Jarley consoled Nell with many kind words , and requested as a personal favour that whenever she thought of Miss Monflathers , she would do nothing else but laugh at her , all the days of her life .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 18]: So ended Mrs Jarley 's wrath , which subsided long before the going down of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 26]: Nell 's anxieties , however , were of a deeper kind , and the checks they imposed upon her cheerfulness were not so easily removed .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 25]: That evening , as she had dreaded , her grandfather stole away , and did not come back until the night was far spent .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 41]: Worn out as she was , and fatigued in mind and body , she sat up alone , counting the minutes , until he returned -- penniless , broken-spirited , and wretched , but still hotly bent upon his infatuation .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 18]: ` Get me money , ' he said wildly , as they parted for the night . '
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 7]: I must have money , Nell .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 36]: It shall be paid thee back with gallant interest one day , but all the money that comes into thy hands , must be mine -- not for myself , but to use for thee .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 10]: Remember , Nell , to use for thee ! '
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 33]: What could the child do with the knowledge she had , but give him every penny that came into her hands , lest he should be tempted on to rob their benefactress ?
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 52]: If she told the truth -LRB- so thought the child -RRB- he would be treated as a madman ; if she did not supply him with money , he would supply himself ; supplying him , she fed the fire that burnt him up , and put him perhaps beyond recovery .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 60]: Distracted by these thoughts , borne down by the weight of the sorrow which she dared not tell , tortured by a crowd of apprehensions whenever the old man was absent , and dreading alike his stay and his return , the colour forsook her cheek , her eye grew dim , and her heart was oppressed and heavy .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 41]: All her old sorrows had come back upon her , augmented by new fears and doubts ; by day they were ever present to her mind ; by night they hovered round her pillow , and haunted her in dreams .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 52]: It was natural that , in the midst of her affliction , she should often revert to that sweet young lady of whom she had only caught a hasty glance , but whose sympathy , expressed in one slight brief action , dwelt in her memory like the kindnesses of years .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 44]: She would often think , if she had such a friend as that to whom to tell her griefs , how much lighter her heart would be -- that if she were but free to hear that voice , she would be happier .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 56]: Then she would wish that she were something better , that she were not quite so poor and humble , that she dared address her without fearing a repulse ; and then feel that there was an immeasurable distance between them , and have no hope that the young lady thought of her any more .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 72]: It was now holiday-time at the schools , and the young ladies had gone home , and Miss Monflathers was reported to be flourishing in London , and damaging the hearts of middle-aged gentlemen , but nobody said anything about Miss Edwards , whether she had gone home , or whether she had any home to go to , whether she was still at the school , or anything about her .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 57]: But one evening , as Nell was returning from a lonely walk , she happened to pass the inn where the stage-coaches stopped , just as one drove up , and there was the beautiful girl she so well remembered , pressing forward to embrace a young child whom they were helping down from the roof .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 55]: Well , this was her sister , her little sister , much younger than Nell , whom she had not seen -LRB- so the story went afterwards -RRB- for five years , and to bring whom to that place on a short visit , she had been saving her poor means all that time .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 14]: Nell felt as if her heart would break when she saw them meet .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 33]: They went a little apart from the knot of people who had congregated about the coach , and fell upon each other 's neck , and sobbed , and wept with joy .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 34]: Their plain and simple dress , the distance which the child had come alone , their agitation and delight , and the tears they shed , would have told their history by themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 27]: They became a little more composed in a short time , and went away , not so much hand in hand as clinging to each other .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 11]: ` Are you sure you 're happy , sister ? '
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 11]: said the child as they passed where Nell was standing .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 9]: ` Quite happy now , ' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 5]: ` But always ? '
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 4]: said the child .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 14]: ` Ah , sister , why do you turn away your face ? '
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 10]: Nell could not help following at a little distance .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 23]: They went to the house of an old nurse , where the elder sister had engaged a bed-room for the child . '
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 23]: I shall come to you early every morning , ' she said , ` and we can be together all the day .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 10]: -- ' -- ` Why not at night-time too ?
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 13]: Dear sister , would they be angry with you for that ? '
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 21]: Why were the eyes of little Nell wet , that night , with tears like those of the two sisters ?
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 24]: Why did she bear a grateful heart because they had met , and feel it pain to think that they would shortly part ?
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 61]: Let us not believe that any selfish reference -- unconscious though it might have been -- to her own trials awoke this sympathy , but thank God that the innocent joys of others can strongly move us , and that we , even in our fallen nature , have one source of pure emotion which must be prized in Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 93]: By morning 's cheerful glow , but oftener still by evening 's gentle light , the child , with a respect for the short and happy intercourse of these two sisters which forbade her to approach and say a thankful word , although she yearned to do so , followed them at a distance in their walks and rambles , stopping when they stopped , sitting on the grass when they sat down , rising when they went on , and feeling it a companionship and delight to be so near them .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 10]: Their evening walk was by a river 's side .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 61]: Here , every night , the child was too , unseen by them , unthought of , unregarded ; but feeling as if they were her friends , as if they had confidences and trusts together , as if her load were lightened and less hard to bear ; as if they mingled their sorrows , and found mutual consolation .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 44]: It was a weak fancy perhaps , the childish fancy of a young and lonely creature ; but night after night , and still the sisters loitered in the same place , and still the child followed with a mild and softened heart .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 74]: She was much startled , on returning home one night , to find that Mrs Jarley had commanded an announcement to be prepared , to the effect that the stupendous collection would only remain in its present quarters one day longer ; in fulfilment of which threat -LRB- for all announcements connected with public amusements are well known to be irrevocable and most exact -RRB- , the stupendous collection shut up next day .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 12]: ` Are we going from this place directly , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 3]: said Nell .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 11]: ` Look here , child , ' returned Mrs Jarley .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 7]: ` That 'll inform you . '
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 54]: And so saying Mrs Jarley produced another announcement , wherein it was stated , that , in consequence of numerous inquiries at the wax-work door , and in consequence of crowds having been disappointed in obtaining admission , the Exhibition would be continued for one week longer , and would re-open next day .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 34]: ` For now that the schools are gone , and the regular sight-seers exhausted , ' said Mrs Jarley , ` we come to the General Public , and they want stimulating . '
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 42]: Upon the following day at noon , Mrs Jarley established herself behind the highly-ornamented table , attended by the distinguished effigies before mentioned , and ordered the doors to be thrown open for the readmission of a discerning and enlightened public .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 62]: But the first day 's operations were by no means of a successful character , inasmuch as the general public , though they manifested a lively interest in Mrs Jarley personally , and such of her waxen satellites as were to be seen for nothing , were not affected by any impulses moving them to the payment of sixpence a head .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 118]: Thus , notwithstanding that a great many people continued to stare at the entry and the figures therein displayed ; and remained there with great perseverance , by the hour at a time , to hear the barrel-organ played and to read the bills ; and notwithstanding that they were kind enough to recommend their friends to patronise the exhibition in the like manner , until the door-way was regularly blockaded by half the population of the town , who , when they went off duty , were relieved by the other half ; it was not found that the treasury was any the richer , or that the prospects of the establishment were at all encouraging .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 26]: In this depressed state of the classical market , Mrs Jarley made extraordinary efforts to stimulate the popular taste , and whet the popular curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 87]: Certain machinery in the body of the nun on the leads over the door was cleaned up and put in motion , so that the figure shook its head paralytically all day long , to the great admiration of a drunken , but very Protestant , barber over the way , who looked upon the said paralytic motion as typical of the degrading effect wrought upon the human mind by the ceremonies of the Romish Church and discoursed upon that theme with great eloquence and morality .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 55]: The two carters constantly passed in and out of the exhibition-room , under various disguises , protesting aloud that the sight was better worth the money than anything they had beheld in all their lives , and urging the bystanders , with tears in their eyes , not to neglect such a brilliant gratification .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 61]: Mrs Jarley sat in the pay-place , chinking silver moneys from noon till night , and solemnly calling upon the crowd to take notice that the price of admission was only sixpence , and that the departure of the whole collection , on a short tour among the Crowned Heads of Europe , was positively fixed for that day week .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 26]: ` So be in time , be in time , be in time , ' said Mrs Jarley at the close of every such address .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 34]: ` Remember that this is Jarley 's stupendous collection of upwards of One Hundred Figures , and that it is the only collection in the world ; all others being imposters and deceptions .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 13]: Be in time , be in time , be in time ! '
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 104]: Chapter 33 As the course of this tale requires that we should become acquainted , somewhere hereabouts , with a few particulars connected with the domestic economy of Mr Sampson Brass , and as a more convenient place than the present is not likely to occur for that purpose , the historian takes the friendly reader by the hand , and springing with him into the air , and cleaving the same at a greater rate than ever Don Cleophas Leandro Perez Zambullo and his familiar travelled through that pleasant region in company , alights with him upon the pavement of Bevis Marks .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 18]: The intrepid aeronauts alight before a small dark house , once the residence of Mr Sampson Brass .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 110]: In the parlour window of this little habitation , which is so close upon the footway that the passenger who takes the wall brushes the dim glass with his coat sleeve -- much to its improvement , for it is very dirty -- in this parlour window in the days of its occupation by Sampson Brass , there hung , all awry and slack , and discoloured by the sun , a curtain of faded green , so threadbare from long service as by no means to intercept the view of the little dark room , but rather to afford a favourable medium through which to observe it accurately .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 8]: There was not much to look at .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 187]: A rickety table , with spare bundles of papers , yellow and ragged from long carriage in the pocket , ostentatiously displayed upon its top ; a couple of stools set face to face on opposite sides of this crazy piece of furniture ; a treacherous old chair by the fire-place , whose withered arms had hugged full many a client and helped to squeeze him dry ; a second-hand wig box , used as a depository for blank writs and declarations and other small forms of law , once the sole contents of the head which belonged to the wig which belonged to the box , as they were now of the box itself ; two or three common books of practice ; a jar of ink , a pounce box , a stunted hearth-broom , a carpet trodden to shreds but still clinging with the tightness of desperation to its tacks -- these , with the yellow wainscot of the walls , the smoke-discoloured ceiling , the dust and cobwebs , were among the most prominent decorations of the office of Mr Sampson Brass .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 46]: But this was mere still-life , of no greater importance than the plate , ` BRASS , Solicitor , ' upon the door , and the bill , ` First floor to let to a single gentleman , ' which was tied to the knocker .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 31]: The office commonly held two examples of animated nature , more to the purpose of this history , and in whom it has a stronger interest and more particular concern .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 17]: Of these , one was Mr Brass himself , who has already appeared in these pages .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 48]: The other was his clerk , assistant , housekeeper , secretary , confidential plotter , adviser , intriguer , and bill of cost increaser , Miss Brass -- a kind of amazon at common law , of whom it may be desirable to offer a brief description .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 65]: Miss Sally Brass , then , was a lady of thirty-five or thereabouts , of a gaunt and bony figure , and a resolute bearing , which if it repressed the softer emotions of love , and kept admirers at a distance , certainly inspired a feeling akin to awe in the breasts of those male strangers who had the happiness to approach her .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 107]: In face she bore a striking resemblance to her brother , Sampson -- so exact , indeed , was the likeness between them , that had it consorted with Miss Brass 's maiden modesty and gentle womanhood to have assumed her brother 's clothes in a frolic and sat down beside him , it would have been difficult for the oldest friend of the family to determine which was Sampson and which Sally , especially as the lady carried upon her upper lip certain reddish demonstrations , which , if the imagination had been assisted by her attire , might have been mistaken for a beard .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 33]: These were , however , in all probability , nothing more than eyelashes in a wrong place , as the eyes of Miss Brass were quite free from any such natural impertinencies .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 37]: In complexion Miss Brass was sallow -- rather a dirty sallow , so to speak -- but this hue was agreeably relieved by the healthy glow which mantled in the extreme tip of her laughing nose .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 21]: Her voice was exceedingly impressive -- deep and rich in quality , and , once heard , not easily forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 44]: Her usual dress was a green gown , in colour not unlike the curtain of the office window , made tight to the figure , and terminating at the throat , where it was fastened behind by a peculiarly large and massive button .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 65]: Feeling , no doubt , that simplicity and plainness are the soul of elegance , Miss Brass wore no collar or kerchief except upon her head , which was invariably ornamented with a brown gauze scarf , like the wing of the fabled vampire , and which , twisted into any form that happened to suggest itself , formed an easy and graceful head-dress .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 7]: Such was Miss Brass in person .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 60]: In mind , she was of a strong and vigorous turn , having from her earliest youth devoted herself with uncommon ardour to the study of law ; not wasting her speculations upon its eagle flights , which are rare , but tracing it attentively through all the slippery and eel-like crawlings in which it commonly pursues its way .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 64]: Nor had she , like many persons of great intellect , confined herself to theory , or stopped short where practical usefulness begins ; inasmuch as she could ingross , fair-copy , fill up printed forms with perfect accuracy , and , in short , transact any ordinary duty of the office down to pouncing a skin of parchment or mending a pen .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 104]: It is difficult to understand how , possessed of these combined attractions , she should remain Miss Brass ; but whether she had steeled her heart against mankind , or whether those who might have wooed and won her , were deterred by fears that , being learned in the law , she might have too near her fingers ' ends those particular statutes which regulate what are familiarly termed actions for breach , certain it is that she was still in a state of celibacy , and still in daily occupation of her old stool opposite to that of her brother Sampson .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 25]: And equally certain it is , by the way , that between these two stools a great many people had come to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 85]: One morning Mr Sampson Brass sat upon his stool copying some legal process , and viciously digging his pen deep into the paper , as if he were writing upon the very heart of the party against whom it was directed ; and Miss Sally Brass sat upon her stool making a new pen preparatory to drawing out a little bill , which was her favourite occupation ; and so they sat in silence for a long time , until Miss Brass broke silence .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 9]: ` Have you nearly done , Sammy ? '
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 23]: said Miss Brass ; for in her mild and feminine lips , Sampson became Sammy , and all things were softened down .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 8]: ` No , ' returned her brother .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 19]: ` It would have been all done though , if you had helped at the right time . '
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 21]: ` Oh yes , indeed , ' cried Miss Sally ; ` you want my help , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 14]: -- YOU , too , that are going to keep a clerk ! '
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 25]: ` Am I going to keep a clerk for my own pleasure , or because of my own wish , you provoking rascal ! '
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 18]: said Mr Brass , putting his pen in his mouth , and grinning spitefully at his sister .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 15]: ` What do you taunt me about going to keep a clerk for ? '
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 61]: It may be observed in this place , lest the fact of Mr Brass calling a lady a rascal , should occasion any wonderment or surprise , that he was so habituated to having her near him in a man 's capacity , that he had gradually accustomed himself to talk to her as though she were really a man .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 60]: And this feeling was so perfectly reciprocal , that not only did Mr Brass often call Miss Brass a rascal , or even put an adjective before the rascal , but Miss Brass looked upon it as quite a matter of course , and was as little moved as any other lady would be by being called an angel .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 24]: ` What do you taunt me , after three hours ' talk last night , with going to keep a clerk for ? '
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 22]: repeated Mr Brass , grinning again with the pen in his mouth , like some nobleman 's or gentleman 's crest .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 6]: Is it my fault ? '
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 76]: ` All I know is , ' said Miss Sally , smiling drily , for she delighted in nothing so much as irritating her brother , ` that if every one of your clients is to force us to keep a clerk , whether we want to or not , you had better leave off business , strike yourself off the roll , and get taken in execution , as soon as you can . '
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 11]: ` Have we got any other client like him ? '
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 3]: said Brass .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 17]: ` Have we got another client like him now -- will you answer me that ? '
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 9]: ` Do you mean in the face ! '
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 4]: said his sister .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 9]: ` Do I mean in the face ! '
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 18]: sneered Sampson Brass , reaching over to take up the bill-book , and fluttering its leaves rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 22]: ` Look here -- Daniel Quilp , Esquire -- Daniel Quilp , Esquire -- Daniel Quilp , Esquire -- all through .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 30]: Whether should I take a clerk that he recommends , and says , `` this is the man for you , '' or lose all this , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 19]: Miss Sally deigned to make no reply , but smiled again , and went on with her work .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 16]: ` But I know what it is , ' resumed Brass after a short silence .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 23]: ` You 're afraid you wo n't have as long a finger in the business as you 've been used to have .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 11]: Do you think I do n't see through that ? '
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 22]: ` The business would n't go on very long , I expect , without me , ' returned his sister composedly .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 25]: ` Do n't you be a fool and provoke me , Sammy , but mind what you 're doing , and do it . '
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 49]: Sampson Brass , who was at heart in great fear of his sister , sulkily bent over his writing again , and listened as she said : ` If I determined that the clerk ought not to come , of course he would n't be allowed to come .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 13]: You know that well enough , so do n't talk nonsense . '
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 45]: Mr Brass received this observation with increased meekness , merely remarking , under his breath , that he did n't like that kind of joking , and that Miss Sally would be ' a much better fellow ' if she forbore to aggravate him .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 25]: To this compliment Miss Sally replied , that she had a relish for the amusement , and had no intention to forego its gratification .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 32]: Mr Brass not caring , as it seemed , to pursue the subject any further , they both plied their pens at a great pace , and there the discussion ended .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 21]: While they were thus employed , the window was suddenly darkened , as by some person standing close against it .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 29]: As Mr Brass and Miss Sally looked up to ascertain the cause , the top sash was nimbly lowered from without , and Quilp thrust in his head .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 4]: ` Hallo ! '
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 17]: he said , standing on tip-toe on the window-sill , and looking down into the room .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 7]: ` is there anybody at home ?
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 10]: Is there any of the Devil 's ware here ?
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 9]: Is Brass at a premium , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 8]: ` Ha , ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 8]: laughed the lawyer in an affected ecstasy .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 8]: ` Oh , very good , Sir !
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 6]: Oh , very good indeed !
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 3]: Quite eccentric !
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 9]: Dear me , what humour he has ! '
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 7]: ` Is that my Sally ? '
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 10]: croaked the dwarf , ogling the fair Miss Brass .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 18]: ` Is it Justice with the bandage off her eyes , and without the sword and scales ?
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 9]: Is it the Strong Arm of the Law ?
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 8]: Is it the Virgin of Bevis ? '
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 9]: ` What an amazing flow of spirits ! '
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 3]: cried Brass .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 11]: ` Upon my word , it 's quite extraordinary ! '
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 16]: ` Open the door , ' said Quilp , ` I 've got him here .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 18]: Such a clerk for you , Brass , such a prize , such an ace of trumps .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 37]: Be quick and open the door , or if there 's another lawyer near and he should happen to look out of window , he 'll snap him up before your eyes , he will . '
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 65]: It is probable that the loss of the phoenix of clerks , even to a rival practitioner , would not have broken Mr Brass 's heart ; but , pretending great alacrity , he rose from his seat , and going to the door , returned , introducing his client , who led by the hand no less a person than Mr Richard Swiveller .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 62]: ` There she is , ' said Quilp , stopping short at the door , and wrinkling up his eyebrows as he looked towards Miss Sally ; ` there is the woman I ought to have married -- there is the beautiful Sarah -- there is the female who has all the charms of her sex and none of their weaknesses .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 6]: Oh Sally , Sally ! '
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 12]: To this amorous address Miss Brass briefly responded ` Bother ! '
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 16]: ` Hard-hearted as the metal from which she takes her name , ' said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 19]: ` Why do n't she change it -- melt down the brass , and take another name ? '
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 21]: ` Hold your nonsense , Mr Quilp , do , ' returned Miss Sally , with a grim smile . '
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 15]: I wonder you 're not ashamed of yourself before a strange young man . '
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 26]: ` The strange young man , ' said Quilp , handing Dick Swiveller forward , ` is too susceptible himself not to understand me well .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 50]: This is Mr Swiveller , my intimate friend -- a gentleman of good family and great expectations , but who , having rather involved himself by youthful indiscretion , is content for a time to fill the humble station of a clerk -- humble , but here most enviable .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 6]: What a delicious atmosphere ! '
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 37]: If Mr Quilp spoke figuratively , and meant to imply that the air breathed by Miss Sally Brass was sweetened and rarefied by that dainty creature , he had doubtless good reason for what he said .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 76]: But if he spoke of the delights of the atmosphere of Mr Brass 's office in a literal sense , he had certainly a peculiar taste , as it was of a close and earthy kind , and , besides being frequently impregnated with strong whiffs of the second-hand wearing apparel exposed for sale in Duke 's Place and Houndsditch , had a decided flavour of rats and mice , and a taint of mouldiness .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 33]: Perhaps some doubts of its pure delight presented themselves to Mr Swiveller , as he gave vent to one or two short abrupt sniffs , and looked incredulously at the grinning dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 37]: ` Mr Swiveller , ' said Quilp , ` being pretty well accustomed to the agricultural pursuits of sowing wild oats , Miss Sally , prudently considers that half a loaf is better than no bread .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 23]: To be out of harm 's way he prudently thinks is something too , and therefore he accepts your brother 's offer .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 9]: Brass , Mr Swiveller is yours . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 17]: I am very glad , Sir , ' said Mr Brass , ` very glad indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 13]: Mr Swiveller , Sir , is fortunate enough to have your friendship .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 17]: You may be very proud , Sir , to have the friendship of Mr Quilp . '
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 67]: Dick murmured something about never wanting a friend or a bottle to give him , and also gasped forth his favourite allusion to the wing of friendship and its never moulting a feather ; but his faculties appeared to be absorbed in the contemplation of Miss Sally Brass , at whom he stared with blank and rueful looks , which delighted the watchful dwarf beyond measure .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 36]: As to the divine Miss Sally herself , she rubbed her hands as men of business do , and took a few turns up and down the office with her pen behind her ear . '
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 26]: I suppose , ' said the dwarf , turning briskly to his legal friend , ` that Mr Swiveller enters upon his duties at once ?
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 6]: It 's Monday morning . '
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 18]: ` At once , if you please , Sir , by all means , ' returned Brass .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 48]: ` Miss Sally will teach him law , the delightful study of the law , ' said Quilp ; ` she 'll be his guide , his friend , his companion , his Blackstone , his Coke upon Littleton , his Young Lawyer 's Best Companion . '
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 41]: ` He is exceedingly eloquent , ' said Brass , like a man abstracted , and looking at the roofs of the opposite houses , with his hands in his pockets ; ` he has an extraordinary flow of language .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 5]: Beautiful , really . '
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 26]: ` With Miss Sally , ' Quilp went on , ` and the beautiful fictions of the law , his days will pass like minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 39]: Those charming creations of the poet , John Doe and Richard Roe , when they first dawn upon him , will open a new world for the enlargement of his mind and the improvement of his heart . '
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 7]: ` Oh , beautiful , beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 4]: Beau-ti-ful indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 3]: cried Brass .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 10]: ` It 's a treat to hear him ! '
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 8]: ` Where will Mr Swiveller sit ? '
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 6]: said Quilp , looking round .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 15]: ` Why , we 'll buy another stool , sir , ' returned Brass .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 31]: ` We had n't any thoughts of having a gentleman with us , sir , until you were kind enough to suggest it , and our accommodation 's not extensive .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 11]: We 'll look about for a second-hand stool , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 46]: In the meantime , if Mr Swiveller will take my seat , and try his hand at a fair copy of this ejectment , as I shall be out pretty well all the morning -- ' ` Walk with me , ' said Quilp . '
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 15]: I have a word or two to say to you on points of business .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 7]: Can you spare the time ? '
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 13]: ` Can I spare the time to walk with you , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 22]: You 're joking , sir , you 're joking with me , ' replied the lawyer , putting on his hat .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 10]: ` I 'm ready , sir , quite ready .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 20]: My time must be fully occupied indeed , sir , not to leave me time to walk with you .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 22]: It 's not everybody , sir , who has an opportunity of improving himself by the conversation of Mr Quilp . '
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 28]: The dwarf glanced sarcastically at his brazen friend , and , with a short dry cough , turned upon his heel to bid adieu to Miss Sally .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 33]: After a very gallant parting on his side , and a very cool and gentlemanly sort of one on hers , he nodded to Dick Swiveller , and withdrew with the attorney .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 36]: Dick stood at the desk in a state of utter stupefaction , staring with all his might at the beauteous Sally , as if she had been some curious animal whose like had never lived .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 37]: When the dwarf got into the street , he mounted again upon the window-sill , and looked into the office for a moment with a grinning face , as a man might peep into a cage .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 41]: Dick glanced upward at him , but without any token of recognition ; and long after he had disappeared , still stood gazing upon Miss Sally Brass , seeing or thinking of nothing else , and rooted to the spot .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 44]: Miss Brass being by this time deep in the bill of costs , took no notice whatever of Dick , but went scratching on , with a noisy pen , scoring down the figures with evident delight , and working like a steam-engine .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 60]: There stood Dick , gazing now at the green gown , now at the brown head-dress , now at the face , and now at the rapid pen , in a state of stupid perplexity , wondering how he got into the company of that strange monster , and whether it was a dream and he would ever wake .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 16]: At last he heaved a deep sigh , and began slowly pulling off his coat .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 78]: Mr Swiveller pulled off his coat , and folded it up with great elaboration , staring at Miss Sally all the time ; then put on a blue jacket with a double row of gilt buttons , which he had originally ordered for aquatic expeditions , but had brought with him that morning for office purposes ; and , still keeping his eye upon her , suffered himself to drop down silently upon Mr Brass 's stool .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 42]: Then he underwent a relapse , and becoming powerless again , rested his chin upon his hand , and opened his eyes so wide , that it appeared quite out of the question that he could ever close them any more .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 56]: When he had looked so long that he could see nothing , Dick took his eyes off the fair object of his amazement , turned over the leaves of the draft he was to copy , dipped his pen into the inkstand , and at last , and by slow approaches , began to write .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 27]: But he had not written half-a-dozen words when , reaching over to the inkstand to take a fresh dip , he happened to raise his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 35]: There was the intolerable brown head-dress -- there was the green gown -- there , in short , was Miss Sally Brass , arrayed in all her charms , and more tremendous than ever .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 42]: This happened so often , that Mr Swiveller by degrees began to feel strange influences creeping over him -- horrible desires to annihilate this Sally Brass -- mysterious promptings to knock her head-dress off and try how she looked without it .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 18]: There was a very large ruler on the table ; a large , black , shining ruler .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 14]: Mr Swiveller took it up and began to rub his nose with it .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 32]: From rubbing his nose with the ruler , to poising it in his hand and giving it an occasional flourish after the tomahawk manner , the transition was easy and natural .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 57]: In some of these flourishes it went close to Miss Sally 's head ; the ragged edges of the head-dress fluttered with the wind it raised ; advance it but an inch , and that great brown knot was on the ground : yet still the unconscious maiden worked away , and never raised her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 8]: Well , this was a great relief .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 41]: It was a good thing to write doggedly and obstinately until he was desperate , and then snatch up the ruler and whirl it about the brown head-dress with the consciousness that he could have it off if he liked .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 46]: It was a good thing to draw it back , and rub his nose very hard with it , if he thought Miss Sally was going to look up , and to recompense himself with more hardy flourishes when he found she was still absorbed .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 47]: By these means Mr Swiveller calmed the agitation of his feelings , until his applications to the ruler became less fierce and frequent , and he could even write as many as half-a-dozen consecutive lines without having recourse to it -- which was a great victory .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 66]: Chapter 34 In course of time , that is to say , after a couple of hours or so , of diligent application , Miss Brass arrived at the conclusion of her task , and recorded the fact by wiping her pen upon the green gown , and taking a pinch of snuff from a little round tin box which she carried in her pocket .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 37]: Having disposed of this temperate refreshment , she arose from her stool , tied her papers into a formal packet with red tape , and taking them under her arm , marched out of the office .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 50]: Mr Swiveller had scarcely sprung off his seat and commenced the performance of a maniac hornpipe , when he was interrupted , in the fulness of his joy at being again alone , by the opening of the door , and the reappearance of Miss Sally 's head . '
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 10]: I am going out , ' said Miss Brass .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 10]: ` Very good , ma'am , ' returned Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 20]: ` And do n't hurry yourself on my account to come back , ma'am , ' he added inwardly .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 32]: ` If anybody comes on office business , take their messages , and say that the gentleman who attends to that matter is n't in at present , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 5]: said Miss Brass . '
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 10]: I will , ma'am , ' replied Dick . '
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 14]: I sha n't be very long , ' said Miss Brass , retiring .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 21]: ` I 'm sorry to hear it , ma'am , ' rejoined Dick when she had shut the door . '
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 10]: I hope you may be unexpectedly detained , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 21]: If you could manage to be run over , ma'am , but not seriously , so much the better . '
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 38]: Uttering these expressions of good-will with extreme gravity , Mr Swiveller sat down in the client 's chair and pondered ; then took a few turns up and down the room and fell into the chair again .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 12]: ` So I 'm Brass 's clerk , am I ? '
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 7]: ` Brass 's clerk , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 14]: And the clerk of Brass 's sister -- clerk to a female Dragon .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 6]: Very good , very good !
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 6]: What shall I be next ?
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 48]: Shall I be a convict in a felt hat and a grey suit , trotting about a dockyard with my number neatly embroidered on my uniform , and the order of the garter on my leg , restrained from chafing my ankle by a twisted belcher handkerchief ?
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 5]: Shall I be that ?
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 10]: Will that do , or is it too genteel ?
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 14]: Whatever you please , have it your own way , of course . '
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 61]: As he was entirely alone , it may be presumed that , in these remarks , Mr Swiveller addressed himself to his fate or destiny , whom , as we learn by the precedents , it is the custom of heroes to taunt in a very bitter and ironical manner when they find themselves in situations of an unpleasant nature .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 44]: This is the more probable from the circumstance of Mr Swiveller directing his observations to the ceiling , which these bodily personages are usually supposed to inhabit -- except in theatrical cases , when they live in the heart of the great chandelier .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 80]: ` Quilp offers me this place , which he says he can insure me , ' resumed Dick after a thoughtful silence , and telling off the circumstances of his position , one by one , upon his fingers ; ` Fred , who , I could have taken my affidavit , would not have heard of such a thing , backs Quilp to my astonishment , and urges me to take it also -- staggerer , number one !
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 36]: My aunt in the country stops the supplies , and writes an affectionate note to say that she has made a new will , and left me out of it -- staggerer , number two .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 38]: No money ; no credit ; no support from Fred , who seems to turn steady all at once ; notice to quit the old lodgings -- staggerers , three , four , five , and six !
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 15]: Under an accumulation of staggerers , no man can be considered a free agent .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 21]: No man knocks himself down ; if his destiny knocks him down , his destiny must pick him up again .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 34]: Then I 'm very glad that mine has brought all this upon itself , and I shall be as careless as I can , and make myself quite at home to spite it .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 36]: So go on my buck , ' said Mr Swiveller , taking his leave of the ceiling with a significant nod , ` and let us see which of us will be tired first ! '
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 46]: Dismissing the subject of his downfall with these reflections , which were no doubt very profound , and are indeed not altogether unknown in certain systems of moral philosophy , Mr Swiveller shook off his despondency and assumed the cheerful ease of an irresponsible clerk .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 75]: As a means towards his composure and self-possession , he entered into a more minute examination of the office than he had yet had time to make ; looked into the wig-box , the books , and ink-bottle ; untied and inspected all the papers ; carved a few devices on the table with a sharp blade of Mr Brass 's penknife ; and wrote his name on the inside of the wooden coal-scuttle .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 89]: Having , as it were , taken formal possession of his clerkship in virtue of these proceedings , he opened the window and leaned negligently out of it until a beer-boy happened to pass , whom he commanded to set down his tray and to serve him with a pint of mild porter , which he drank upon the spot and promptly paid for , with the view of breaking ground for a system of future credit and opening a correspondence tending thereto , without loss of time .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 62]: Then , three or four little boys dropped in , on legal errands from three or four attorneys of the Brass grade : whom Mr Swiveller received and dismissed with about as professional a manner , and as correct and comprehensive an understanding of their business , as would have been shown by a clown in a pantomime under similar circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 35]: These things done and over , he got upon his stool again and tried his hand at drawing caricatures of Miss Brass with a pen and ink , whistling very cheerfully all the time .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 23]: He was occupied in this diversion when a coach stopped near the door , and presently afterwards there was a loud double-knock .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 39]: As this was no business of Mr Swiveller 's , the person not ringing the office bell , he pursued his diversion with perfect composure , notwithstanding that he rather thought there was nobody else in the house .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 43]: In this , however , he was mistaken ; for , after the knock had been repeated with increased impatience , the door was opened , and somebody with a very heavy tread went up the stairs and into the room above .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 30]: Mr Swiveller was wondering whether this might be another Miss Brass , twin sister to the Dragon , when there came a rapping of knuckles at the office door .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 5]: ` Come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 7]: ` Do n't stand upon ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 13]: The business will get rather complicated if I 've many more customers .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 4]: Come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 27]: ` Oh , please , ' said a little voice very low down in the doorway , ` will you come and show the lodgings ? '
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 32]: Dick leant over the table , and descried a small slipshod girl in a dirty coarse apron and bib , which left nothing of her visible but her face and feet .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 11]: She might as well have been dressed in a violin-case .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 8]: ` Why , who are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 20]: To which the only reply was , ` Oh , please will you come and show the lodgings ? '
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 13]: There never was such an old-fashioned child in her looks and manner .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 10]: She must have been at work from her cradle .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 16]: She seemed as much afraid of Dick , as Dick was amazed at her . '
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 16]: I hav 'n' t got anything to do with the lodgings , ' said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 8]: ` Tell 'em to call again . '
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 32]: ` Oh , but please will you come and show the lodgings , ' returned the girl ; ` It 's eighteen shillings a week and us finding plate and linen .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 16]: Boots and clothes is extra , and fires in winter-time is eightpence a day . '
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 9]: ` Why do n't you show 'em yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 12]: You seem to know all about 'em , ' said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 28]: ` Miss Sally said I was n't to , because people would n't believe the attendance was good if they saw how small I was first . '
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 18]: ` Well , but they 'll see how small you are afterwards , wo n't they ? '
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 35]: But then they 'll have taken 'em for a fortnight certain , ' replied the child with a shrewd look ; ` and people do n't like moving when they 're once settled . '
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 15]: ` This is a queer sort of thing , ' muttered Dick , rising .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 14]: ` What do you mean to say you are -- the cook ? '
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 13]: ` Yes , I do plain cooking ; ' replied the child .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 17]: ` I 'm housemaid too ; I do all the work of the house . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 19]: I suppose Brass and the Dragon and I do the dirtiest part of it , ' thought Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 45]: And he might have thought much more , being in a doubtful and hesitating mood , but that the girl again urged her request , and certain mysterious bumping sounds on the passage and staircase seemed to give note of the applicant 's impatience .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 41]: Richard Swiveller , therefore , sticking a pen behind each ear , and carrying another in his mouth as a token of his great importance and devotion to business , hurried out to meet and treat with the single gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 63]: He was a little surprised to perceive that the bumping sounds were occasioned by the progress up-stairs of the single gentleman 's trunk , which , being nearly twice as wide as the staircase , and exceedingly heavy withal , it was no easy matter for the united exertions of the single gentleman and the coachman to convey up the steep ascent .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 73]: But there they were , crushing each other , and pushing and pulling with all their might , and getting the trunk tight and fast in all kinds of impossible angles , and to pass them was out of the question ; for which sufficient reason , Mr Swiveller followed slowly behind , entering a new protest on every stair against the house of Mr Sampson Brass being thus taken by storm .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 39]: To these remonstrances , the single gentleman answered not a word , but when the trunk was at last got into the bed-room , sat down upon it and wiped his bald head and face with his handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 47]: He was very warm , and well he might be ; for , not to mention the exertion of getting the trunk up stairs , he was closely muffled in winter garments , though the thermometer had stood all day at eighty-one in the shade . '
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 28]: I believe , sir , ' said Richard Swiveller , taking his pen out of his mouth , ` that you desire to look at these apartments .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 8]: They are very charming apartments , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 29]: They command an uninterrupted view of -- of over the way , and they are within one minute 's walk of -- of the corner of the street .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 21]: There is exceedingly mild porter , sir , in the immediate vicinity , and the contingent advantages are extraordinary . '
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 7]: ` What 's the rent ? '
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 5]: said the single gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 15]: ` One pound per week , ' replied Dick , improving on the terms .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 7]: ` I 'll take 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 34]: ` The boots and clothes are extras , ' said Dick ; ` and the fires in winter time are -- ' ` Are all agreed to , ' answered the single gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 19]: ` Two weeks certain , ' said Dick , ` are the -- ' ` Two weeks ! '
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 13]: cried the single gentleman gruffly , eyeing him from top to toe .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 4]: ` Two years .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 8]: I shall live here for two years .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 2]: Here .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 4]: Ten pounds down .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 6]: The bargain 's made . '
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 25]: ` Why you see , ' said Dick , ` my name is not Brass , and -- ' ` Who said it was ?
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 6]: My name 's not Brass .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 4]: What then ? '
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 15]: ` The name of the master of the house is , ' said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 23]: ` I 'm glad of it , ' returned the single gentleman ; ` it 's a good name for a lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 6]: Coachman , you may go .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 7]: So may you , Sir . '
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 35]: Mr Swiveller was so much confounded by the single gentleman riding roughshod over him at this rate , that he stood looking at him almost as hard as he had looked at Miss Sally .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 41]: The single gentleman , however , was not in the slightest degree affected by this circumstance , but proceeded with perfect composure to unwind the shawl which was tied round his neck , and then to pull off his boots .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 33]: Freed of these encumbrances , he went on to divest himself of his other clothing , which he folded up , piece by piece , and ranged in order on the trunk .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 28]: Then , he pulled down the window-blinds , drew the curtains , wound up his watch , and , quite leisurely and methodically , got into bed .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 34]: ` Take down the bill , ' were his parting words , as he looked out from between the curtains ; ` and let nobody call me till I ring the bell . '
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 13]: With that the curtains closed , and he seemed to snore immediately .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 13]: ` This is a most remarkable and supernatural sort of house ! '
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 17]: said Mr Swiveller , as he walked into the office with the bill in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 42]: ` She-dragons in the business , conducting themselves like professional gentlemen ; plain cooks of three feet high appearing mysteriously from under ground ; strangers walking in and going to bed without leave or licence in the middle of the day !
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 33]: If he should be one of the miraculous fellows that turn up now and then , and has gone to sleep for two years , I shall be in a pleasant situation .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 15]: It 's my destiny , however , and I hope Brass may like it .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 9]: I shall be sorry if he do n't .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 18]: But it 's no business of mine -- I have nothing whatever to do with it ! '
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 57]: Chapter 35 Mr Brass on returning home received the report of his clerk with much complacency and satisfaction , and was particular in inquiring after the ten-pound note , which , proving on examination to be a good and lawful note of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England , increased his good-humour considerably .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 77]: Indeed he so overflowed with liberality and condescension , that , in the fulness of his heart , he invited Mr Swiveller to partake of a bowl of punch with him at that remote and indefinite period which is currently denominated ` one of these days , ' and paid him many handsome compliments on the uncommon aptitude for business which his conduct on the first day of his devotion to it had so plainly evinced .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 78]: It was a maxim with Mr Brass that the habit of paying compliments kept a man 's tongue oiled without any expense ; and , as that useful member ought never to grow rusty or creak in turning on its hinges in the case of a practitioner of the law , in whom it should be always glib and easy , he lost few opportunities of improving himself by the utterance of handsome speeches and eulogistic expressions .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 115]: And this had passed into such a habit with him , that , if he could not be correctly said to have his tongue at his fingers ' ends , he might certainly be said to have it anywhere but in his face : which being , as we have already seen , of a harsh and repulsive character , was not oiled so easily , but frowned above all the smooth speeches -- one of nature 's beacons , warning off those who navigated the shoals and breakers of the World , or of that dangerous strait the Law , and admonishing them to seek less treacherous harbours and try their fortune elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 124]: While Mr Brass by turns overwhelmed his clerk with compliments and inspected the ten-pound note , Miss Sally showed little emotion and that of no pleasurable kind , for as the tendency of her legal practice had been to fix her thoughts on small gains and gripings , and to whet and sharpen her natural wisdom , she was not a little disappointed that the single gentleman had obtained the lodgings at such an easy rate , arguing that when he was seen to have set his mind upon them , he should have been at the least charged double or treble the usual terms , and that , in exact proportion as he pressed forward , Mr Swiveller should have hung back .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 68]: But neither the good opinion of Mr Brass , nor the dissatisfaction of Miss Sally , wrought any impression upon that young gentleman , who , throwing the responsibility of this and all other acts and deeds thereafter to be done by him , upon his unlucky destiny , was quite resigned and comfortable : fully prepared for the worst , and philosophically indifferent to the best .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 21]: ` Good morning , Mr Richard , ' said Brass , on the second day of Mr Swiveller 's clerkship .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 16]: ` Sally found you a second-hand stool , Sir , yesterday evening , in Whitechapel .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 17]: She 's a rare fellow at a bargain , I can tell you , Mr Richard .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 17]: You 'll find that a first-rate stool , Sir , take my word for it . '
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 15]: ` It 's rather a crazy one to look at , ' said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 23]: ` You 'll find it a most amazing stool to sit down upon , you may depend , ' returned Mr Brass .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 46]: ` It was bought in the open street just opposite the hospital , and as it has been standing there a month of two , it has got rather dusty and a little brown from being in the sun , that 's all . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 33]: I hope it has n't got any fevers or anything of that sort in it , ' said Dick , sitting himself down discontentedly , between Mr Sampson and the chaste Sally .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 12]: ` One of the legs is longer than the others . '
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 16]: ` Then we get a bit of timber in , Sir , ' retorted Brass .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 7]: ` Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 25]: We get a bit of timber in , Sir , and that 's another advantage of my sister 's going to market for us .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 16]: Miss Brass , Mr Richard is the -- ' ` Will you keep quiet ? '
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 14]: interrupted the fair subject of these remarks , looking up from her papers .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 13]: ` How am I to work if you keep on chattering ? '
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 9]: ` What an uncertain chap you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 4]: returned the lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 9]: ` Sometimes you 're all for a chat .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 9]: At another time you 're all for work .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 13]: A man never knows what humour he 'll find you in . '
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 24]: ` I 'm in a working humour now , ' said Sally , ` so do n't disturb me , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 24]: And do n't take him , ' Miss Sally pointed with the feather of her pen to Richard , ` off his business .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 15]: He wo n't do more than he can help , I dare say . '
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 57]: Mr Brass had evidently a strong inclination to make an angry reply , but was deterred by prudent or timid considerations , as he only muttered something about aggravation and a vagabond ; not associating the terms with any individual , but mentioning them as connected with some abstract ideas which happened to occur to him .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 89]: They went on writing for a long time in silence after this -- in such a dull silence that Mr Swiveller -LRB- who required excitement -RRB- had several times fallen asleep , and written divers strange words in an unknown character with his eyes shut , when Miss Sally at length broke in upon the monotony of the office by pulling out the little tin box , taking a noisy pinch of snuff , and then expressing her opinion that Mr Richard Swiveller had ` done it . '
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 7]: ` Done what , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 3]: said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 37]: ` Do you know , ' returned Miss Brass , ` that the lodger is n't up yet -- that nothing has been seen or heard of him since he went to bed yesterday afternoon ? '
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 30]: ` Well , ma'am , ' said Dick , ' I suppose he may sleep his ten pound out , in peace and quietness , if he likes . '
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 14]: I begin to think he 'll never wake , ' observed Miss Sally .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 23]: ` It 's a very remarkable circumstance , ' said Brass , laying down his pen ; ` really , very remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 56]: Mr Richard , you 'll remember , if this gentleman should be found to have hung himself to the bed-post , or any unpleasant accident of that kind should happen -- you 'll remember , Mr Richard , that this ten pound note was given to you in part payment of two years ' rent ?
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 34]: You 'll bear that in mind , Mr Richard ; you had better make a note of it , sir , in case you should ever be called upon to give evidence . '
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 28]: Mr Swiveller took a large sheet of foolscap , and with a countenance of profound gravity , began to make a very small note in one corner .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 13]: ` We can never be too cautious , ' said Mr Brass .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 17]: ` There is a deal of wickedness going about the world , a deal of wickedness .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 25]: Did the gentleman happen to say , Sir -- but never mind that at present , sir ; finish that little memorandum first . '
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 27]: Dick did so , and handed it to Mr Brass , who had dismounted from his stool , and was walking up and down the office .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 12]: ` Oh , this is the memorandum , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 10]: said Brass , running his eye over the document .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 4]: ` Very good .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 13]: Now , Mr Richard , did the gentleman say anything else ? '
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 23]: ` Are you sure , Mr Richard , ' said Brass , solemnly , ` that the gentleman said nothing else ? '
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 11]: ` Devil a word , Sir , ' replied Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 102]: ` Think again , Sir , ' said Brass ; ` it 's my duty , Sir , in the position in which I stand , and as an honourable member of the legal profession -- the first profession in this country , Sir , or in any other country , or in any of the planets that shine above us at night and are supposed to be inhabited -- it 's my duty , Sir , as an honourable member of that profession , not to put to you a leading question in a matter of this delicacy and importance .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 43]: Did the gentleman , Sir , who took the first floor of you yesterday afternoon , and who brought with him a box of property -- a box of property -- say anything more than is set down in this memorandum ? '
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 14]: ` Come , do n't be a fool , ' said Miss Sally .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 24]: Dick looked at her , and then at Brass , and then at Miss Sally again , and still said ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 5]: ` Pooh , pooh !
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 13]: Deuce take it , Mr Richard , how dull you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 8]: cried Brass , relaxing into a smile .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 9]: ` Did he say anything about his property ?
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 4]: -- there ! '
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 19]: ` That 's the way to put it , ' said Miss Sally , nodding to her brother .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 168]: ` Did he say , for instance , ' added Brass , in a kind of comfortable , cozy tone -- ' I do n't assert that he did say so , mind ; I only ask you , to refresh your memory -- did he say , for instance , that he was a stranger in London -- that it was not his humour or within his ability to give any references -- that he felt we had a right to require them -- and that , in case anything should happen to him , at any time , he particularly desired that whatever property he had upon the premises should be considered mine , as some slight recompense for the trouble and annoyance I should sustain -- and were you , in short , ' added Brass , still more comfortably and cozily than before , ` were you induced to accept him on my behalf , as a tenant , upon those conditions ? '
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 8]: ` Certainly not , ' replied Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 40]: ` Why then , Mr Richard , ' said Brass , darting at him a supercilious and reproachful look , ` it 's my opinion that you 've mistaken your calling , and will never make a lawyer . '
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 14]: ` Not if you live a thousand years , ' added Miss Sally .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 25]: Whereupon the brother and sister took each a noisy pinch of snuff from the little tin box , and fell into a gloomy thoughtfulness .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 24]: Nothing further passed up to Mr Swiveller 's dinner-time , which was at three o'clock , and seemed about three weeks in coming .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 13]: At the first stroke of the hour , the new clerk disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 31]: At the last stroke of five , he reappeared , and the office , as if by magic , became fragrant with the smell of gin and water and lemon-peel .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 16]: ` Mr Richard , ' said Brass , ` this man 's not up yet .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 7]: Nothing will wake him , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 8]: What 's to be done ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 13]: I should let him have his sleep out , ' returned Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 5]: ` Sleep out ! '
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 14]: cried Brass ; ` why he has been asleep now , six-and-twenty hours .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 52]: We have been moving chests of drawers over his head , we have knocked double knocks at the street-door , we have made the servant-girl fall down stairs several times -LRB- she 's a light weight , and it do n't hurt her much , -RRB- but nothing wakes him . '
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 42]: ` Perhaps a ladder , ' suggested Dick , ` and getting in at the first-floor window -- ' ` But then there 's a door between ; besides , the neighbours would be up in arms , ' said Brass .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 24]: ` What do you say to getting on the roof of the house through the trap-door , and dropping down the chimney ? '
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 3]: suggested Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 45]: ` That would be an excellent plan , ' said Brass , ` if anybody would be -- ' and here he looked very hard at Mr Swiveller -- ` would be kind , and friendly , and generous enough , to undertake it .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 16]: I dare say it would not be anything like as disagreeable as one supposes . '
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 19]: Dick had made the suggestion , thinking that the duty might possibly fall within Miss Sally 's department .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 59]: As he said nothing further , and declined taking the hint , Mr Brass was fain to propose that they should go up stairs together , and make a last effort to awaken the sleeper by some less violent means , which , if they failed on this last trial , must positively be succeeded by stronger measures .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 51]: Mr Swiveller , assenting , armed himself with his stool and the large ruler , and repaired with his employer to the scene of action , where Miss Brass was already ringing a hand-bell with all her might , and yet without producing the smallest effect upon their mysterious lodger .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 10]: ` There are his boots , Mr Richard ! '
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 3]: said Brass .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 13]: ` Very obstinate-looking articles they are too , ' quoth Richard Swiveller .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 61]: And truly , they were as sturdy and bluff a pair of boots as one would wish to see ; as firmly planted on the ground as if their owner 's legs and feet had been in them ; and seeming , with their broad soles and blunt toes , to hold possession of their place by main force . '
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 26]: I ca n't see anything but the curtain of the bed , ' said Brass , applying his eye to the keyhole of the door .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 11]: ` Is he a strong man , Mr Richard ? '
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 6]: Very , ' answered Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 19]: It would be an extremely unpleasant circumstance if he was to bounce out suddenly , ' said Brass .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 6]: ` Keep the stairs clear .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 31]: I should be more than a match for him , of course , but I 'm the master of the house , and the laws of hospitality must be respected .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 4]: -- Hallo there !
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 5]: Hallo , hallo ! '
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 96]: While Mr Brass , with his eye curiously twisted into the keyhole , uttered these sounds as a means of attracting the lodger 's attention , and while Miss Brass plied the hand-bell , Mr Swiveller put his stool close against the wall by the side of the door , and mounting on the top and standing bolt upright , so that if the lodger did make a rush , he would most probably pass him in its onward fury , began a violent battery with the ruler upon the upper panels of the door .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 95]: Captivated with his own ingenuity , and confident in the strength of his position , which he had taken up after the method of those hardy individuals who open the pit and gallery doors of theatres on crowded nights , Mr Swiveller rained down such a shower of blows , that the noise of the bell was drowned ; and the small servant , who lingered on the stairs below , ready to fly at a moment 's notice , was obliged to hold her ears lest she should be rendered deaf for life .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 14]: Suddenly the door was unlocked on the inside , and flung violently open .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 66]: The small servant flew to the coal-cellar ; Miss Sally dived into her own bed-room ; Mr Brass , who was not remarkable for personal courage , ran into the next street , and finding that nobody followed him , armed with a poker or other offensive weapon , put his hands in his pockets , walked very slowly all at once , and whistled .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 73]: Meanwhile , Mr Swiveller , on the top of the stool , drew himself into as flat a shape as possible against the wall , and looked , not unconcernedly , down upon the single gentleman , who appeared at the door growling and cursing in a very awful manner , and , with the boots in his hand , seemed to have an intention of hurling them down stairs on speculation .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 8]: This idea , however , he abandoned .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 22]: He was turning into his room again , still growling vengefully , when his eyes met those of the watchful Richard .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 10]: ` Have YOU been making that horrible noise ? '
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 6]: said the single gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 44]: I have been helping , sir , ' returned Dick , keeping his eye upon him , and waving the ruler gently in his right hand , as an indication of what the single gentleman had to expect if he attempted any violence .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 15]: ` How dare you then , ' said the lodger , ` Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 57]: To this , Dick made no other reply than by inquiring whether the lodger held it to be consistent with the conduct and character of a gentleman to go to sleep for six-and-twenty hours at a stretch , and whether the peace of an amiable and virtuous family was to weigh as nothing in the balance .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 7]: ` Is my peace nothing ? '
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 5]: said the single gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 9]: ` Is their peace nothing , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 4]: returned Dick . '
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 57]: I do n't wish to hold out any threats , sir -- indeed the law does not allow of threats , for to threaten is an indictable offence -- but if ever you do that again , take care you 're not sat upon by the coroner and buried in a cross road before you wake .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 58]: We have been distracted with fears that you were dead , Sir , ' said Dick , gently sliding to the ground , ` and the short and the long of it is , that we can not allow single gentlemen to come into this establishment and sleep like double gentlemen without paying extra for it . '
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 4]: ` Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 4]: cried the lodger .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 58]: ` Yes , Sir , indeed , ' returned Dick , yielding to his destiny and saying whatever came uppermost ; ` an equal quantity of slumber was never got out of one bed and bedstead , and if you 're going to sleep in that way , you must pay for a double-bedded room . ' .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 28]: Instead of being thrown into a greater passion by these remarks , the lodger lapsed into a broad grin and looked at Mr Swiveller with twinkling eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 20]: He was a brown-faced sun-burnt man , and appeared browner and more sun-burnt from having a white nightcap on .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 37]: As it was clear that he was a choleric fellow in some respects , Mr Swiveller was relieved to find him in such good humour , and , to encourage him in it , smiled himself .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 26]: The lodger , in the testiness of being so rudely roused , had pushed his nightcap very much on one side of his bald head .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 54]: This gave him a rakish eccentric air which , now that he had leisure to observe it , charmed Mr Swiveller exceedingly ; therefore , by way of propitiation , he expressed his hope that the gentleman was going to get up , and further that he would never do so any more .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 9]: ` Come here , you impudent rascal ! '
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 11]: was the lodger 's answer as he re-entered his room .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 21]: Mr Swiveller followed him in , leaving the stool outside , but reserving the ruler in case of a surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 24]: He rather congratulated himself on his prudence when the single gentleman , without notice or explanation of any kind , double-locked the door .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 7]: ` Can you drink anything ? '
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 5]: was his next inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 35]: Mr Swiveller replied that he had very recently been assuaging the pangs of thirst , but that he was still open to ' a modest quencher , ' if the materials were at hand .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 35]: Without another word spoken on either side , the lodger took from his great trunk , a kind of temple , shining as of polished silver , and placed it carefully on the table .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 12]: Greatly interested in his proceedings , Mr Swiveller observed him closely .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 42]: Into one little chamber of this temple , he dropped an egg ; into another some coffee ; into a third a compact piece of raw steak from a neat tin case ; into a fourth , he poured some water .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 83]: Then , with the aid of a phosphorus-box and some matches , he procured a light and applied it to a spirit-lamp which had a place of its own below the temple ; then , he shut down the lids of all the little chambers ; then he opened them ; and then , by some wonderful and unseen agency , the steak was done , the egg was boiled , the coffee was accurately prepared , and his breakfast was ready .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 39]: ` Hot water -- ' said the lodger , handing it to Mr Swiveller with as much coolness as if he had a kitchen fire before him -- ` extraordinary rum -- sugar -- and a travelling glass .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 4]: Mix for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 5]: And make haste . '
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 32]: Dick complied , his eyes wandering all the time from the temple on the table , which seemed to do everything , to the great trunk which seemed to hold everything .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 22]: The lodger took his breakfast like a man who was used to work these miracles , and thought nothing of them .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 15]: ` The man of the house is a lawyer , is he not ? '
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 4]: said the lodger .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 3]: Dick nodded .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 5]: The rum was amazing .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 13]: ` The woman of the house -- what 's she ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 7]: A dragon , ' said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 38]: The single gentleman , perhaps because he had met with such things in his travels , or perhaps because he WAS a single gentleman , evinced no surprise , but merely inquired ` Wife or Sister ? '
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 8]: -- ` Sister , ' said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 26]: -- ` So much the better , ' said the single gentleman , ` he can get rid of her when he likes . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 58]: I want to do as I like , young man , ' he added after a short silence ; ` to go to bed when I like , get up when I like , come in when I like , go out when I like -- to be asked no questions and be surrounded by no spies .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 10]: In this last respect , servants are the devil .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 7]: There 's only one here . '
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 11]: ` And a very little one , ' said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 12]: ` And a very little one , ' repeated the lodger .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 13]: ` Well , the place will suit me , will it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 7]: ` Sharks , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 4]: said the lodger .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 9]: Dick nodded assent , and drained his glass .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 15]: ` Let them know my humour , ' said the single gentleman , rising .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 12]: ` If they disturb me , they lose a good tenant .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 12]: If they know me to be that , they know enough .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 14]: If they try to know more , it 's a notice to quit .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 10]: It 's better to understand these things at once .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 5]: Good day . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 24]: I beg your pardon , ' said Dick , halting in his passage to the door , which the lodger prepared to open .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 21]: ` When he who adores thee has left but the name -- ' ` What do you mean ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 35]: -- But the name , ' said Dick -- ` has left but the name -- in case of letters or parcels -- ' ' I never have any , ' returned the lodger .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 10]: ` Or in the case anybody should call . '
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 8]: ` Nobody ever calls on me . '
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 29]: ` If any mistake should arise from not having the name , do n't say it was my fault , Sir , ' added Dick , still lingering .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 41]: -- ` Oh blame not the bard -- ' ` I 'll blame nobody , ' said the lodger , with such irascibility that in a moment Dick found himself on the staircase , and the locked door between them .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 27]: Mr Brass and Miss Sally were lurking hard by , having been , indeed , only routed from the keyhole by Mr Swiveller 's abrupt exit .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 62]: As their utmost exertions had not enabled them to overhear a word of the interview , however , in consequence of a quarrel for precedence , which , though limited of necessity to pushes and pinches and such quiet pantomime , had lasted the whole time , they hurried him down to the office to hear his account of the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 94]: This Mr Swiveller gave them -- faithfully as regarded the wishes and character of the single gentleman , and poetically as concerned the great trunk , of which he gave a description more remarkable for brilliancy of imagination than a strict adherence to truth ; declaring , with many strong asseverations , that it contained a specimen of every kind of rich food and wine , known in these times , and in particular that it was of a self-acting kind and served up whatever was required , as he supposed by clock-work .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 134]: He also gave them to understand that the cooking apparatus roasted a fine piece of sirloin of beef , weighing about six pounds avoir-dupoise , in two minutes and a quarter , as he had himself witnessed , and proved by his sense of taste ; and further , that , however the effect was produced , he had distinctly seen water boil and bubble up when the single gentleman winked ; from which facts he -LRB- Mr Swiveller -RRB- was led to infer that the lodger was some great conjuror or chemist , or both , whose residence under that roof could not fail at some future days to shed a great credit and distinction on the name of Brass , and add a new interest to the history of Bevis Marks .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 75]: There was one point which Mr Swiveller deemed it unnecessary to enlarge upon , and that was the fact of the modest quencher , which , by reason of its intrinsic strength and its coming close upon the heels of the temperate beverage he had discussed at dinner , awakened a slight degree of fever , and rendered necessary two or three other modest quenchers at the public-house in the course of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 118]: Chapter 36 As the single gentleman after some weeks ' occupation of his lodgings , still declined to correspond , by word or gesture , either with Mr Brass or his sister Sally , but invariably chose Richard Swiveller as his channel of communication ; and as he proved himself in all respects a highly desirable inmate , paying for everything beforehand , giving very little trouble , making no noise , and keeping early hours ; Mr Richard imperceptibly rose to an important position in the family , as one who had influence over this mysterious lodger , and could negotiate with him , for good or evil , when nobody else durst approach his person .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 161]: If the truth must be told , even Mr Swiveller 's approaches to the single gentleman were of a very distant kind , and met with small encouragement ; but , as he never returned from a monosyllabic conference with the unknown , without quoting such expressions as ` Swiveller , I know I can rely upon you , ' -- ' I have no hesitation in saying , Swiveller , that I entertain a regard for you , ' -- ` Swiveller , you are my friend , and will stand by me I am sure , ' with many other short speeches of the same familiar and confiding kind , purporting to have been addressed by the single gentleman to himself , and to form the staple of their ordinary discourse , neither Mr Brass nor Miss Sally for a moment questioned the extent of his influence , but accorded to him their fullest and most unqualified belief .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 33]: But quite apart from , and independent of , this source of popularity , Mr Swiveller had another , which promised to be equally enduring , and to lighten his position considerably .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 11]: He found favour in the eyes of Miss Sally Brass .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 45]: Let not the light scorners of female fascination erect their ears to listen to a new tale of love which shall serve them for a jest ; for Miss Brass , however accurately formed to be beloved , was not of the loving kind .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 55]: That amiable virgin , having clung to the skirts of the Law from her earliest youth ; having sustained herself by their aid , as it were , in her first running alone , and maintained a firm grasp upon them ever since ; had passed her life in a kind of legal childhood .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 97]: She had been remarkable , when a tender prattler for an uncommon talent in counterfeiting the walk and manner of a bailiff : in which character she had learned to tap her little playfellows on the shoulder , and to carry them off to imaginary sponging-houses , with a correctness of imitation which was the surprise and delight of all who witnessed her performances , and which was only to be exceeded by her exquisite manner of putting an execution into her doll 's house , and taking an exact inventory of the chairs and tables .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 77]: These artless sports had naturally soothed and cheered the decline of her widowed father : a most exemplary gentleman -LRB- called ` old Foxey ' by his friends from his extreme sagacity , -RRB- who encouraged them to the utmost , and whose chief regret , on finding that he drew near to Houndsditch churchyard , was , that his daughter could not take out an attorney 's certificate and hold a place upon the roll .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 50]: Filled with this affectionate and touching sorrow , he had solemnly confided her to his son Sampson as an invaluable auxiliary ; and from the old gentleman 's decease to the period of which we treat , Miss Sally Brass had been the prop and pillar of his business .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 66]: It is obvious that , having devoted herself from infancy to this one pursuit and study , Miss Brass could know but little of the world , otherwise than in connection with the law ; and that from a lady gifted with such high tastes , proficiency in those gentler and softer arts in which women usually excel , was scarcely to be looked for .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 14]: Miss Sally 's accomplishments were all of a masculine and strictly legal kind .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 14]: They began with the practice of an attorney and they ended with it .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 13]: She was in a state of lawful innocence , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 7]: The law had been her nurse .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 47]: And , as bandy-legs or such physical deformities in children are held to be the consequence of bad nursing , so , if in a mind so beautiful any moral twist or handiness could be found , Miss Sally Brass 's nurse was alone to blame .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 91]: It was on this lady , then , that Mr Swiveller burst in full freshness as something new and hitherto undreamed of , lighting up the office with scraps of song and merriment , conjuring with inkstands and boxes of wafers , catching three oranges in one hand , balancing stools upon his chin and penknives on his nose , and constantly performing a hundred other feats with equal ingenuity ; for with such unbendings did Richard , in Mr Brass 's absence , relieve the tedium of his confinement .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 48]: These social qualities , which Miss Sally first discovered by accident , gradually made such an impression upon her , that she would entreat Mr Swiveller to relax as though she were not by , which Mr Swiveller , nothing loth , would readily consent to do .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 10]: By these means a friendship sprung up between them .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 25]: Mr Swiveller gradually came to look upon her as her brother Sampson did , and as he would have looked upon any other clerk .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 38]: He imparted to her the mystery of going the odd man or plain Newmarket for fruit , ginger-beer , baked potatoes , or even a modest quencher , of which Miss Brass did not scruple to partake .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 67]: He would often persuade her to undertake his share of writing in addition to her own ; nay , he would sometimes reward her with a hearty slap on the back , and protest that she was a devilish good fellow , a jolly dog , and so forth ; all of which compliments Miss Sally would receive in entire good part and with perfect satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 54]: One circumstance troubled Mr Swiveller 's mind very much , and that was that the small servant always remained somewhere in the bowels of the earth under Bevis Marks , and never came to the surface unless the single gentleman rang his bell , when she would answer it and immediately disappear again .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 53]: She never went out , or came into the office , or had a clean face , or took off the coarse apron , or looked out of any one of the windows , or stood at the street-door for a breath of air , or had any rest or enjoyment whatever .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 17]: Nobody ever came to see her , nobody spoke of her , nobody cared about her .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 37]: Mr Brass had said once , that he believed she was a ` love-child ' -LRB- which means anything but a child of love -RRB- , and that was all the information Richard Swiveller could obtain .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 28]: ` It 's of no use asking the dragon , ' thought Dick one day , as he sat contemplating the features of Miss Sally Brass . '
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 19]: I suspect if I asked any questions on that head , our alliance would be at an end .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 16]: I wonder whether she is a dragon by-the-bye , or something in the mermaid way .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 7]: She has rather a scaly appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 18]: But mermaids are fond of looking at themselves in the glass , which she ca n't be .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 15]: And they have a habit of combing their hair , which she has n't .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 8]: No , she 's a dragon . '
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 10]: ` Where are you going , old fellow ? '
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 23]: said Dick aloud , as Miss Sally wiped her pen as usual on the green dress , and uprose from her seat .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 9]: ` To dinner , ' answered the dragon .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 5]: ` To dinner ! '
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 9]: thought Dick , ` that 's another circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 14]: I do n't believe that small servant ever has anything to eat . '
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 12]: ` Sammy wo n't be home , ' said Miss Brass .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 7]: ` Stop till I come back .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 8]: I sha 'n' t be long . '
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 34]: Dick nodded , and followed Miss Brass -- with his eyes to the door , and with his ears to a little back parlour , where she and her brother took their meals .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 43]: ` Now , ' said Dick , walking up and down with his hands in his pockets , ` I 'd give something -- if I had it -- to know how they use that child , and where they keep her .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 24]: My mother must have been a very inquisitive woman ; I have no doubt I 'm marked with a note of interrogation somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 49]: My feelings I smother , but thou hast been the cause of this anguish , my -- upon my word , ' said Mr Swiveller , checking himself and falling thoughtfully into the client 's chair , ' I should like to know how they use her ! '
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 36]: After running on , in this way , for some time , Mr Swiveller softly opened the office door , with the intention of darting across the street for a glass of the mild porter .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 21]: At that moment he caught a parting glimpse of the brown head-dress of Miss Brass flitting down the kitchen stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 6]: ` And by Jove ! '
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 13]: thought Dick , ` she 's going to feed the small servant .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 5]: Now or never ! '
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 50]: First peeping over the handrail and allowing the head-dress to disappear in the darkness below , he groped his way down , and arrived at the door of a back kitchen immediately after Miss Brass had entered the same , bearing in her hand a cold leg of mutton .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 24]: It was a very dark miserable place , very low and very damp : the walls disfigured by a thousand rents and blotches .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 27]: The water was trickling out of a leaky butt , and a most wretched cat was lapping up the drops with the sickly eagerness of starvation .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 30]: The grate , which was a wide one , was wound and screwed up tight , so as to hold no more than a little thin sandwich of fire .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 21]: Everything was locked up ; the coal-cellar , the candle-box , the salt-box , the meat-safe , were all padlocked .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 11]: There was nothing that a beetle could have lunched upon .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 14]: The pinched and meagre aspect of the place would have killed a chameleon .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 27]: He would have known , at the first mouthful , that the air was not eatable , and must have given up the ghost in despair .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 17]: The small servant stood with humility in presence of Miss Sally , and hung her head .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 6]: ` Are you there ? '
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 4]: said Miss Sally .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 14]: ` Yes , ma'am , ' was the answer in a weak voice .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 25]: ` Go further away from the leg of mutton , or you 'll be picking it , I know , ' said Miss Sally .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 38]: The girl withdrew into a corner , while Miss Brass took a key from her pocket , and opening the safe , brought from it a dreary waste of cold potatoes , looking as eatable as Stonehenge .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 36]: This she placed before the small servant , ordering her to sit down before it , and then , taking up a great carving-knife , made a mighty show of sharpening it upon the carving-fork .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 7]: ` Do you see this ? '
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 30]: said Miss Brass , slicing off about two square inches of cold mutton , after all this preparation , and holding it out on the point of the fork .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 31]: The small servant looked hard enough at it with her hungry eyes to see every shred of it , small as it was , and answered , ` yes . '
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 23]: ` Then do n't you ever go and say , ' retorted Miss Sally , ` that you had n't meat here .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 7]: There , eat it up . '
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 5]: This was soon done .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 10]: ` Now , do you want any more ? '
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 4]: said Miss Sally .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 11]: The hungry creature answered with a faint ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 9]: They were evidently going through an established form .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 47]: ` You 've been helped once to meat , ' said Miss Brass , summing up the facts ; ` you have had as much as you can eat , you 're asked if you want any more , and you answer , ` no ! '
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 16]: Then do n't you ever go and say you were allowanced , mind that . '
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 32]: With those words , Miss Sally put the meat away and locked the safe , and then drawing near to the small servant , overlooked her while she finished the potatoes .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 78]: It was plain that some extraordinary grudge was working in Miss Brass 's gentle breast , and that it was that which impelled her , without the smallest present cause , to rap the child with the blade of the knife , now on her hand , now on her head , and now on her back , as if she found it quite impossible to stand so close to her without administering a few slight knocks .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 58]: But Mr Swiveller was not a little surprised to see his fellow-clerk , after walking slowly backwards towards the door , as if she were trying to withdraw herself from the room but could not accomplish it , dart suddenly forward , and falling on the small servant give her some hard blows with her clenched hand .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 43]: The victim cried , but in a subdued manner as if she feared to raise her voice , and Miss Sally , comforting herself with a pinch of snuff , ascended the stairs , just as Richard had safely reached the office .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 41]: Chapter 37 The single gentleman among his other peculiarities -- and he had a very plentiful stock , of which he every day furnished some new specimen -- took a most extraordinary and remarkable interest in the exhibition of Punch .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 72]: If the sound of a Punch 's voice , at ever so remote a distance , reached Bevis Marks , the single gentleman , though in bed and asleep , would start up , and , hurrying on his clothes , make for the spot with all speed , and presently return at the head of a long procession of idlers , having in the midst the theatre and its proprietors .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 61]: Straightway , the stage would be set up in front of Mr Brass 's house ; the single gentleman would establish himself at the first floor window ; and the entertainment would proceed , with all its exciting accompaniments of fife and drum and shout , to the excessive consternation of all sober votaries of business in that silent thoroughfare .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 88]: It might have been expected that when the play was done , both players and audience would have dispersed ; but the epilogue was as bad as the play , for no sooner was the Devil dead , than the manager of the puppets and his partner were summoned by the single gentleman to his chamber , where they were regaled with strong waters from his private store , and where they held with him long conversations , the purport of which no human being could fathom .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 11]: But the secret of these discussions was of little importance .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 125]: It was sufficient to know that while they were proceeding , the concourse without still lingered round the house ; that boys beat upon the drum with their fists , and imitated Punch with their tender voices ; that the office-window was rendered opaque by flattened noses , and the key-hole of the street-door luminous with eyes ; that every time the single gentleman or either of his guests was seen at the upper window , or so much as the end of one of their noses was visible , there was a great shout of execration from the excluded mob , who remained howling and yelling , and refusing consolation , until the exhibitors were delivered up to them to be attended elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 29]: It was sufficient , in short , to know that Bevis Marks was revolutionised by these popular movements , and that peace and quietness fled from its precincts .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 119]: Nobody was rendered more indignant by these proceedings than Mr Sampson Brass , who , as he could by no means afford to lose so profitable an inmate , deemed it prudent to pocket his lodger 's affront along with his cash , and to annoy the audiences who clustered round his door by such imperfect means of retaliation as were open to him , and which were confined to the trickling down of foul water on their heads from unseen watering pots , pelting them with fragments of tile and mortar from the roof of the house , and bribing the drivers of hackney cabriolets to come suddenly round the corner and dash in among them precipitately .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 120]: It may , at first sight , be matter of surprise to the thoughtless few that Mr Brass , being a professional gentleman , should not have legally indicted some party or parties , active in the promotion of the nuisance , but they will be good enough to remember , that as Doctors seldom take their own prescriptions , and Divines do not always practise what they preach , so lawyers are shy of meddling with the Law on their own account : knowing it to be an edged tool of uncertain application , very expensive in the working , and rather remarkable for its properties of close shaving , than for its always shaving the right person .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 19]: ` Come , ' said Mr Brass one afternoon , ` this is two days without a Punch .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 15]: I 'm in hopes he has run through 'em all , at last . '
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 8]: ` Why are you in hopes ? '
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 4]: returned Miss Sally .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 8]: ` What harm do they do ? '
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 11]: ` Here 's a pretty sort of a fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 10]: cried Brass , laying down his pen in despair .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 9]: ` Now here 's an aggravating animal ! '
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 10]: ` Well , what harm do they do ? '
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 3]: retorted Sally .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 5]: ` What harm ! '
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 3]: cried Brass .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 33]: ` Is it no harm to have a constant hallooing and hooting under one 's very nose , distracting one from business , and making one grind one 's teeth with vexation ?
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 43]: Is it no harm to be blinded and choked up , and have the king 's highway stopped with a set of screamers and roarers whose throats must be made of -- of -- ' ` Brass , ' suggested Mr Swiveller .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 31]: of brass , ' said the lawyer , glancing at his clerk , to assure himself that he had suggested the word in good faith and without any sinister intention .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 7]: ` Is that no harm ? '
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 44]: The lawyer stopped short in his invective , and listening for a moment , and recognising the well-known voice , rested his head upon his hand , raised his eyes to the ceiling , and muttered faintly , ` There 's another ! '
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 9]: Up went the single gentleman 's window directly .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 44]: ` There 's another , ' repeated Brass ; ` and if I could get a break and four blood horses to cut into the Marks when the crowd is at its thickest , I 'd give eighteen-pence and never grudge it ! '
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 7]: The distant squeak was heard again .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 8]: The single gentleman 's door burst open .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 44]: He ran violently down the stairs , out into the street , and so past the window , without any hat , towards the quarter whence the sound proceeded -- bent , no doubt , upon securing the strangers ' services directly . '
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 64]: I wish I only knew who his friends were , ' muttered Sampson , filling his pocket with papers ; ` if they 'd just get up a pretty little Commission de lunatico at the Gray 's Inn Coffee House and give me the job , I 'd be content to have the lodgings empty for one while , at all events . '
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 37]: With which words , and knocking his hat over his eyes as if for the purpose of shutting out even a glimpse of the dreadful visitation , Mr Brass rushed from the house and hurried away .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 137]: As Mr Swiveller was decidedly favourable to these performances , upon the ground that looking at a Punch , or indeed looking at anything out of window , was better than working ; and as he had been , for this reason , at some pains to awaken in his fellow clerk a sense of their beauties and manifold deserts ; both he and Miss Sally rose as with one accord and took up their positions at the window : upon the sill whereof , as in a post of honour , sundry young ladies and gentlemen who were employed in the dry nurture of babies , and who made a point of being present , with their young charges , on such occasions , had already established themselves as comfortably as the circumstances would allow .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 37]: The glass being dim , Mr Swiveller , agreeably to a friendly custom which he had established between them , hitched off the brown head-dress from Miss Sally 's head , and dusted it carefully therewith .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 51]: By the time he had handed it back , and its beautiful wearer had put it on again -LRB- which she did with perfect composure and indifference -RRB- , the lodger returned with the show and showmen at his heels , and a strong addition to the body of spectators .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 85]: The exhibitor disappeared with all speed behind the drapery ; and his partner , stationing himself by the side of the Theatre , surveyed the audience with a remarkable expression of melancholy , which became more remarkable still when he breathed a hornpipe tune into that sweet musical instrument which is popularly termed a mouth-organ , without at all changing the mournful expression of the upper part of his face , though his mouth and chin were , of necessity , in lively spasms .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 17]: The drama proceeded to its close , and held the spectators enchained in the customary manner .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 44]: The sensation which kindles in large assemblies , when they are relieved from a state of breathless suspense and are again free to speak and move , was yet rife , when the lodger , as usual , summoned the men up stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 30]: ` Both of you , ' he called from the window ; for only the actual exhibitor -- a little fat man -- prepared to obey the summons . '
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 7]: I want to talk to you .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 6]: Come both of you ! '
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 10]: Come , Tommy , ' said the little man .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 11]: I a n't a talker , ' replied the other .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 5]: ` Tell him so .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 9]: What should I go and talk for ? '
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 17]: ` Do n't you see the gentleman 's got a bottle and glass up there ? '
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 5]: returned the little man .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 12]: ` And could n't you have said so at first ? '
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 7]: retorted the other with sudden alacrity .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 9]: ` Now , what are you waiting for ?
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 12]: Are you going to keep the gentleman expecting us all day ?
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 7]: have n't you no manners ? '
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 46]: With this remonstrance , the melancholy man , who was no other than Mr Thomas Codlin , pushed past his friend and brother in the craft , Mr Harris , otherwise Short or Trotters , and hurried before him to the single gentleman 's apartment .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 19]: ` Now , my men , ' said the single gentleman ; ` you have done very well .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 5]: What will you take ?
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 12]: Tell that little man behind , to shut the door . '
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 10]: ` Shut the door , ca n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 10]: said Mr Codlin , turning gruffly to his friend .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 21]: ` You might have knowed that the gentleman wanted the door shut , without being told , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 39]: Mr Short obeyed , observing under his breath that his friend seemed unusually ` cranky , ' and expressing a hope that there was no dairy in the neighbourhood , or his temper would certainly spoil its contents .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 26]: The gentleman pointed to a couple of chairs , and intimated by an emphatic nod of his head that he expected them to be seated .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 66]: Messrs Codlin and Short , after looking at each other with considerable doubt and indecision , at length sat down -- each on the extreme edge of the chair pointed out to him -- and held their hats very tight , while the single gentleman filled a couple of glasses from a bottle on the table beside him , and presented them in due form .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 19]: ` You 're pretty well browned by the sun , both of you , ' said their entertainer .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 7]: ` Have you been travelling ? '
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 13]: Mr Short replied in the affirmative with a nod and a smile .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 25]: Mr Codlin added a corroborative nod and a short groan , as if he still felt the weight of the Temple on his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 16]: ` To fairs , markets , races , and so forth , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 5]: pursued the single gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 21]: ` Yes , sir , ' returned Short , ` pretty nigh all over the West of England . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 40]: I have talked to men of your craft from North , East , and South , ' returned their host , in rather a hasty manner ; ` but I never lighted on any from the West before . '
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 26]: ` It 's our reg ` lar summer circuit is the West , master , ' said Short ; ` that 's where it is .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 22]: We takes the East of London in the spring and winter , and the West of England in the summer time .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 28]: Many 's the hard day 's walking in rain and mud , and with never a penny earned , we 've had down in the West . '
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 9]: ` Let me fill your glass again . '
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 28]: ` Much obleeged to you sir , I think I will , ' said Mr Codlin , suddenly thrusting in his own and turning Short 's aside .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 21]: ` I 'm the sufferer , sir , in all the travelling , and in all the staying at home .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 17]: In town or country , wet or dry , hot or cold , Tom Codlin suffers .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 11]: But Tom Codlin is n't to complain for all that .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 4]: Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 27]: Short may complain , but if Codlin grumbles by so much as a word -- oh dear , down with him , down with him directly .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 8]: It is n't his place to grumble .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 9]: That 's quite out of the question . '
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 27]: ` Codlin a n't without his usefulness , ' observed Short with an arch look , ` but he do n't always keep his eyes open .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 8]: He falls asleep sometimes , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 8]: Remember them last races , Tommy . '
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 11]: ` Will you never leave off aggravating a man ? '
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 3]: said Codlin .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 21]: ` It 's very like I was asleep when five-and-tenpence was collected , in one round , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 29]: I was attending to my business , and could n't have my eyes in twenty places at once , like a peacock , no more than you could .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 44]: If I a n't a match for an old man and a young child , you a n't neither , so do n't throw that out against me , for the cap fits your head quite as correct as it fits mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 15]: ` You may as well drop the subject , Tom , ' said Short .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 15]: ` It is n't particular agreeable to the gentleman , I dare say . '
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 55]: ` Then you should n't have brought it up , ' returned Mr Codlin ; ` and I ask the gentleman 's pardon on your account , as a giddy chap that likes to hear himself talk , and do n't much care what he talks about , so that he does talk . '
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 51]: Their entertainer had sat perfectly quiet in the beginning of this dispute , looking first at one man and then at the other , as if he were lying in wait for an opportunity of putting some further question , or reverting to that from which the discourse had strayed .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 31]: But , from the point where Mr Codlin was charged with sleepiness , he had shown an increasing interest in the discussion : which now attained a very high pitch .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 27]: ` You are the two men I want , ' he said , ` the two men I have been looking for , and searching after !
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 13]: Where are that old man and that child you speak of ? '
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 4]: ` Sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 11]: said Short , hesitating , and looking towards his friend .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 16]: ` The old man and his grandchild who travelled with you -- where are they ?
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 23]: It will be worth your while to speak out , I assure you ; much better worth your while than you believe .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 15]: They left you , you say -- at those races , as I understand .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 14]: They have been traced to that place , and there lost sight of .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 16]: Have you no clue , can you suggest no clue , to their recovery ? '
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 37]: ` Did I always say , Thomas , ' cried Short , turning with a look of amazement to his friend , ` that there was sure to be an inquiry after them two travellers ? '
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 5]: ` YOU said ! '
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 4]: returned Mr Codlin .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 19]: ` Did I always say that that ` ere blessed child was the most interesting I ever see ?
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 13]: Did I always say I loved her , and doated on her ?
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 10]: Pretty creetur , I think I hear her now .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 36]: `` Codlin 's my friend , '' she says , with a tear of gratitude a trickling down her little eye ; `` Codlin 's my friend , '' she says -- `` not Short .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 49]: Short 's very well , '' she says ; `` I 've no quarrel with Short ; he means kind , I dare say ; but Codlin , '' she says , `` has the feelings for my money , though he may n't look it . '' '
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 59]: Repeating these words with great emotion , Mr Codlin rubbed the bridge of his nose with his coat-sleeve , and shaking his head mournfully from side to side , left the single gentleman to infer that , from the moment when he lost sight of his dear young charge , his peace of mind and happiness had fled .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 5]: ` Good Heaven ! '
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 34]: said the single gentleman , pacing up and down the room , ` have I found these men at last , only to discover that they can give me no information or assistance !
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 35]: It would have been better to have lived on , in hope , from day to day , and never to have lighted on them , than to have my expectations scattered thus . '
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 10]: ` Stay a minute , ' said Short . '
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 15]: A man of the name of Jerry -- you know Jerry , Thomas ? '
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 16]: ` Oh , do n't talk to me of Jerrys , ' replied Mr Codlin .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 22]: ` How can I care a pinch of snuff for Jerrys , when I think of that ` ere darling child ?
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 27]: `` Codlin 's my friend , '' she says , `` dear , good , kind Codlin , as is always a devising pleasures for me !
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 19]: I do n't object to Short , '' she says , `` but I cotton to Codlin . ''
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 15]: Once , ' said that gentleman reflectively , ` she called me Father Codlin .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 9]: I thought I should have bust ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 61]: A man of the name of Jerry , sir , ' said Short , turning from his selfish colleague to their new acquaintance , ` wot keeps a company of dancing dogs , told me , in a accidental sort of way , that he had seen the old gentleman in connexion with a travelling wax-work , unbeknown to him .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 49]: As they 'd given us the slip , and nothing had come of it , and this was down in the country that he 'd been seen , I took no measures about it , and asked no questions -- But I can , if you like . '
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 8]: ` Is this man in town ? '
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 6]: said the impatient single gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 5]: ` Speak faster . '
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 25]: ` No he is n't , but he will be to-morrow , for he lodges in our house , ' replied Mr Short rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 12]: ` Then bring him here , ' said the single gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 7]: ` Here 's a sovereign a-piece .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 19]: If I can find these people through your means , it is but a prelude to twenty more .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 32]: Return to me to-morrow , and keep your own counsel on this subject -- though I need hardly tell you that ; for you 'll do so for your own sakes .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 12]: Now , give me your address , and leave me . '
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 46]: The address was given , the two men departed , the crowd went with them , and the single gentleman for two mortal hours walked in uncommon agitation up and down his room , over the wondering heads of Mr Swiveller and Miss Sally Brass .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 127]: Chapter 38 Kit -- for it happens at this juncture , not only that we have breathing time to follow his fortunes , but that the necessities of these adventures so adapt themselves to our ease and inclination as to call upon us imperatively to pursue the track we most desire to take -- Kit , while the matters treated of in the last fifteen chapters were yet in progress , was , as the reader may suppose , gradually familiarising himself more and more with Mr and Mrs Garland , Mr Abel , the pony , and Barbara , and gradually coming to consider them one and all as his particular private friends , and Abel Cottage , Finchley , as his own proper home .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 56]: Stay -- the words are written , and may go , but if they convey any notion that Kit , in the plentiful board and comfortable lodging of his new abode , began to think slightingly of the poor fare and furniture of his old dwelling , they do their office badly and commit injustice .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 24]: Who so mindful of those he left at home -- albeit they were but a mother and two young babies -- as Kit ?
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 34]: What boastful father in the fulness of his heart ever related such wonders of his infant prodigy , as Kit never wearied of telling Barbara in the evening time , concerning little Jacob ?
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 49]: Was there ever such a mother as Kit 's mother , on her son 's showing ; or was there ever such comfort in poverty as in the poverty of Kit 's family , if any correct judgment might be arrived at , from his own glowing account !
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 32]: And let me linger in this place , for an instant , to remark that if ever household affections and loves are graceful things , they are graceful in the poor .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 40]: The ties that bind the wealthy and the proud to home may be forged on earth , but those which link the poor man to his humble hearth are of the truer metal and bear the stamp of Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 75]: The man of high descent may love the halls and lands of his inheritance as part of himself : as trophies of his birth and power ; his associations with them are associations of pride and wealth and triumph ; the poor man 's attachment to the tenements he holds , which strangers have held before , and may to-morrow occupy again , has a worthier root , struck deep into a purer soil .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 71]: His household gods are of flesh and blood , with no alloy of silver , gold , or precious stone ; he has no property but in the affections of his own heart ; and when they endear bare floors and walls , despite of rags and toil and scanty fare , that man has his love of home from God , and his rude hut becomes a solemn place .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 132]: if those who rule the destinies of nations would but remember this -- if they would but think how hard it is for the very poor to have engendered in their hearts , that love of home from which all domestic virtues spring , when they live in dense and squalid masses where social decency is lost , or rather never found -- if they would but turn aside from the wide thoroughfares and great houses , and strive to improve the wretched dwellings in bye-ways where only Poverty may walk -- many low roofs would point more truly to the sky , than the loftiest steeple that now rears proudly up from the midst of guilt , and crime , and horrible disease , to mock them by its contrast .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 27]: In hollow voices from Workhouse , Hospital , and jail , this truth is preached from day to day , and has been proclaimed for years .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 32]: It is no light matter -- no outcry from the working vulgar -- no mere question of the people 's health and comforts that may be whistled down on Wednesday nights .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 49]: In love of home , the love of country has its rise ; and who are the truer patriots or the better in time of need -- those who venerate the land , owning its wood , and stream , and earth , and all that they produce ?
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 19]: or those who love their country , boasting not a foot of ground in all its wide domain !
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 74]: Kit knew nothing about such questions , but he knew that his old home was a very poor place , and that his new one was very unlike it , and yet he was constantly looking back with grateful satisfaction and affectionate anxiety , and often indited square-folded letters to his mother , enclosing a shilling or eighteenpence or such other small remittance , which Mr Abel 's liberality enabled him to make .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 73]: Sometimes being in the neighbourhood , he had leisure to call upon her , and then great was the joy and pride of Kit 's mother , and extremely noisy the satisfaction of little Jacob and the baby , and cordial the congratulations of the whole court , who listened with admiring ears to the accounts of Abel Cottage , and could never be told too much of its wonders and magnificence .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 74]: Although Kit was in the very highest favour with the old lady and gentleman , and Mr Abel , and Barbara , it is certain that no member of the family evinced such a remarkable partiality for him as the self-willed pony , who , from being the most obstinate and opinionated pony on the face of the earth , was , in his hands , the meekest and most tractable of animals .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 152]: It is true that in exact proportion as he became manageable by Kit he became utterly ungovernable by anybody else -LRB- as if he had determined to keep him in the family at all risks and hazards -RRB- , and that , even under the guidance of his favourite , he would sometimes perform a great variety of strange freaks and capers , to the extreme discomposure of the old lady 's nerves ; but as Kit always represented that this was only his fun , or a way he had of showing his attachment to his employers , Mrs Garland gradually suffered herself to be persuaded into the belief , in which she at last became so strongly confirmed , that if , in one of these ebullitions , he had overturned the chaise , she would have been quite satisfied that he did it with the very best intentions .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 51]: Besides becoming in a short time a perfect marvel in all stable matters , Kit soon made himself a very tolerable gardener , a handy fellow within doors , and an indispensable attendant on Mr Abel , who every day gave him some new proof of his confidence and approbation .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 60]: Mr Witherden the notary , too , regarded him with a friendly eye ; and even Mr Chuckster would sometimes condescend to give him a slight nod , or to honour him with that peculiar form of recognition which is called ` taking a sight , ' or to favour him with some other salute combining pleasantry with patronage .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 55]: One morning Kit drove Mr Abel to the Notary 's office , as he sometimes did , and having set him down at the house , was about to drive off to a livery stable hard by , when this same Mr Chuckster emerged from the office door , and cried ` Woa-a-a-a-a-a ! '
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 32]: -- dwelling upon the note a long time , for the purpose of striking terror into the pony 's heart , and asserting the supremacy of man over the inferior animals .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 16]: ` Pull up , Snobby , ' cried Mr Chuckster , addressing himself to Kit .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 8]: ` You 're wanted inside here . '
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 11]: ` Has Mr Abel forgotten anything , I wonder ? '
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 6]: said Kit as he dismounted .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 18]: ` Ask no questions , Snobby , ' returned Mr Chuckster , ` but go and see .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 6]: Woa-a-a then , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 12]: If that pony was mine , I 'd break him . '
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 25]: ` You must be very gentle with him , if you please , ' said Kit , ` or you 'll find him troublesome .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 12]: You 'd better not keep on pulling his ears , please .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 9]: I know he wo n't like it . '
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 37]: To this remonstrance Mr Chuckster deigned no other answer , than addressing Kit with a lofty and distant air as ` young feller , ' and requesting him to cut and come again with all speed .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 38]: The ` young feller ' complying , Mr Chuckster put his hands in his pockets , and tried to look as if he were not minding the pony , but happened to be lounging there by accident .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 41]: Kit scraped his shoes very carefully -LRB- for he had not yet lost his reverence for the bundles of papers and the tin boxes , -RRB- and tapped at the office-door , which was quickly opened by the Notary himself .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 10]: come in , Christopher , ' said Mr Witherden .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 7]: ` Is that the lad ? '
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 19]: asked an elderly gentleman , but of a stout , bluff figure -- who was in the room .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 11]: ` That 's the lad , ' said Mr Witherden .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 18]: ` He fell in with my client , Mr Garland , sir , at this very door .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 22]: I have reason to think he is a good lad , sir , and that you may believe what he says .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 49]: Let me introduce Mr Abel Garland , sir -- his young master ; my articled pupil , sir , and most particular friend : -- my most particular friend , sir , ' repeated the Notary , drawing out his silk handkerchief and flourishing it about his face .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 12]: ` Your servant , sir , ' said the stranger gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 15]: ` Yours , sir , I 'm sure , ' replied Mr Abel mildly .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 12]: ` You were wishing to speak to Christopher , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 6]: ` Yes , I was .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 6]: Have I your permission ? '
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 6]: ` By all means . '
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 36]: ` My business is no secret ; or I should rather say it need be no secret here , ' said the stranger , observing that Mr Abel and the Notary were preparing to retire .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 23]: ` It relates to a dealer in curiosities with whom he lived , and in whom I am earnestly and warmly interested .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 34]: I have been a stranger to this country , gentlemen , for very many years , and if I am deficient in form and ceremony , I hope you will forgive me . '
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 17]: ` No forgiveness is necessary , sir ; -- none whatever , ' replied the Notary .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 7]: And so said Mr Abel . '
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 32]: I have been making inquiries in the neighbourhood in which his old master lived , ' said the stranger , ` and I learn that he was served by this lad .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 31]: I have found out his mother 's house , and have been directed by her to this place as the nearest in which I should be likely to find him .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 14]: That 's the cause of my presenting myself here this morning . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 26]: I am very glad of any cause , sir , ' said the Notary , ` which procures me the honour of this visit . '
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 26]: ` Sir , ' retorted the stranger , ` you speak like a mere man of the world , and I think you something better .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 17]: Therefore , pray do not sink your real character in paying unmeaning compliments to me . '
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 4]: ` Hem ! '
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 4]: coughed the Notary .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 10]: ` You 're a plain speaker , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 11]: ` And a plain dealer , ' returned the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 37]: ` It may be my long absence and inexperience that lead me to the conclusion ; but if plain speakers are scarce in this part of the world , I fancy plain dealers are still scarcer .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 20]: If my speaking should offend you , sir , my dealing , I hope , will make amends . '
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 54]: Mr Witherden seemed a little disconcerted by the elderly gentleman 's mode of conducting the dialogue ; and as for Kit , he looked at him in open-mouthed astonishment : wondering what kind of language he would address to him , if he talked in that free and easy way to a Notary .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 68]: It was with no harshness , however , though with something of constitutional irritability and haste , that he turned to Kit and said : ` If you think , my lad , that I am pursuing these inquiries with any other view than that of serving and reclaiming those I am in search of , you do me a very great wrong , and deceive yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 16]: Do n't be deceived , I beg of you , but rely upon my assurance .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 32]: The fact is , gentlemen , ' he added , turning again to the Notary and his pupil , ` that I am in a very painful and wholly unexpected position .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 27]: I came to this city with a darling object at my heart , expecting to find no obstacle or difficulty in the way of its attainment .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 25]: I find myself suddenly checked and stopped short , in the execution of my design , by a mystery which I can not penetrate .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 45]: Every effort I have made to penetrate it , has only served to render it darker and more obscure ; and I am afraid to stir openly in the matter , lest those whom I anxiously pursue , should fly still farther from me .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 44]: I assure you that if you could give me any assistance , you would not be sorry to do so , if you knew how greatly I stand in need of it , and what a load it would relieve me from . '
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 57]: There was a simplicity in this confidence which occasioned it to find a quick response in the breast of the good-natured Notary , who replied , in the same spirit , that the stranger had not mistaken his desire , and that if he could be of service to him , he would , most readily .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 36]: Kit was then put under examination and closely questioned by the unknown gentleman , touching his old master and the child , their lonely way of life , their retired habits , and strict seclusion .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 45]: The nightly absence of the old man , the solitary existence of the child at those times , his illness and recovery , Quilp 's possession of the house , and their sudden disappearance , were all the subjects of much questioning and answer .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 45]: Finally , Kit informed the gentleman that the premises were now to let , and that a board upon the door referred all inquirers to Mr Sampson Brass , Solicitor , of Bevis Marks , from whom he might perhaps learn some further particulars .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 14]: ` Not by inquiry , ' said the gentleman shaking his head . '
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 5]: I live there . '
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 10]: ` Live at Brass 's the attorney 's ! '
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 16]: cried Mr Witherden in some surprise : having professional knowledge of the gentleman in question .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 9]: ` Aye , ' was the reply . '
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 19]: I entered on his lodgings t ` other day , chiefly because I had seen this very board .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 33]: it matters little to me where I live , and I had a desperate hope that some intelligence might be cast in my way there , which would not reach me elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 17]: Yes , I live at Brass 's -- more shame for me , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 18]: ` That 's a mere matter of opinion , ' said the Notary , shrugging his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 12]: ` He is looked upon as rather a doubtful character . '
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 4]: ` Doubtful ? '
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 5]: echoed the other . '
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 12]: I am glad to hear there 's any doubt about it .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 11]: I supposed that had been thoroughly settled , long ago .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 16]: But will you let me speak a word or two with you in private ? '
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 36]: Mr Witherden consenting , they walked into that gentleman 's private closet , and remained there , in close conversation , for some quarter of an hour , when they returned into the outer office .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 28]: The stranger had left his hat in Mr Witherden 's room , and seemed to have established himself in this short interval on quite a friendly footing .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 28]: ` I 'll not detain you any longer now , ' he said , putting a crown into Kit 's hand , and looking towards the Notary .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 8]: ` You shall hear from me again .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 17]: Not a word of this , you know , except to your master and mistress . '
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 17]: ` Mother , sir , would be glad to know -- ' said Kit , faltering .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 7]: ` Glad to know what ? '
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 15]: ` Anything -- so that it was no harm -- about Miss Nell . '
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 4]: ` Would she ?
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 14]: Well then , you may tell her if she can keep a secret .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 12]: But mind , not a word of this to anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 5]: Do n't forget that .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 4]: Be particular . '
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 12]: ` I 'll take care , sir , ' said Kit .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 10]: ` Thankee , sir , and good morning . '
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 68]: Now , it happened that the gentleman , in his anxiety to impress upon Kit that he was not to tell anybody what had passed between them , followed him out to the door to repeat his caution , and it further happened that at that moment the eyes of Mr Richard Swiveller were turned in that direction , and beheld his mysterious friend and Kit together .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 17]: It was quite an accident , and the way in which it came about was this .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 29]: Mr Chuckster , being a gentleman of a cultivated taste and refined spirit , was one of that Lodge of Glorious Apollos whereof Mr Swiveller was Perpetual Grand .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 58]: Mr Swiveller , passing through the street in the execution of some Brazen errand , and beholding one of his Glorious Brotherhood intently gazing on a pony , crossed over to give him that fraternal greeting with which Perpetual Grands are , by the very constitution of their office , bound to cheer and encourage their disciples .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 48]: He had scarcely bestowed upon him his blessing , and followed it with a general remark touching the present state and prospects of the weather , when , lifting up his eyes , he beheld the single gentleman of Bevis Marks in earnest conversation with Christopher Nubbles .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 4]: ` Hallo ! '
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 9]: said Dick , ` who is that ? '
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 28]: ` He called to see my Governor this morning , ' replied Mr Chuckster ; ` beyond that , I do n't know him from Adam . '
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 9]: ` At least you know his name ? '
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 27]: To which Mr Chuckster replied , with an elevation of speech becoming a Glorious Apollo , that he was ` everlastingly blessed ' if he did .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 66]: ` All I know , my dear feller , ' said Mr Chuckster , running his fingers through his hair , ` is , that he is the cause of my having stood here twenty minutes , for which I hate him with a mortal and undying hatred , and would pursue him to the confines of eternity if I could afford the time . '
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 49]: While they were thus discoursing , the subject of their conversation -LRB- who had not appeared to recognise Mr Richard Swiveller -RRB- re-entered the house , and Kit came down the steps and joined them ; to whom Mr Swiveller again propounded his inquiry with no better success .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 25]: ` He is a very nice gentleman , Sir , ' said Kit , ` and that 's all I know about him . '
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 42]: Mr Chuckster waxed wroth at this answer , and without applying the remark to any particular case , mentioned , as a general truth , that it was expedient to break the heads of Snobs , and to tweak their noses .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 45]: Without expressing his concurrence in this sentiment , Mr Swiveller after a few moments of abstraction inquired which way Kit was driving , and , being informed , declared it was his way , and that he would trespass on him for a lift .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 80]: Kit would gladly have declined the proffered honour , but as Mr Swiveller was already established in the seat beside him , he had no means of doing so , otherwise than by a forcible ejectment , and therefore , drove briskly off -- so briskly indeed , as to cut short the leave-taking between Mr Chuckster and his Grand Master , and to occasion the former gentleman some inconvenience from having his corns squeezed by the impatient pony .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 79]: As Whisker was tired of standing , and Mr Swiveller was kind enough to stimulate him by shrill whistles , and various sporting cries , they rattled off at too sharp a pace to admit of much conversation : especially as the pony , incensed by Mr Swiveller 's admonitions , took a particular fancy for the lamp-posts and cart-wheels , and evinced a strong desire to run on the pavement and rasp himself against the brick walls .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 56]: It was not , therefore , until they had arrived at the stable , and the chaise had been extricated from a very small doorway , into which the pony dragged it under the impression that he could take it along with him into his usual stall , that Mr Swiveller found time to talk .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 10]: ` It 's hard work , ' said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 10]: ` What do you say to some beer ? '
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 18]: Kit at first declined , but presently consented , and they adjourned to the neighbouring bar together .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 56]: ` We 'll drink our friend what 's - his-name , ' said Dick , holding up the bright frothy pot ; ' -- that was talking to you this morning , you know -- I know him -- a good fellow , but eccentric -- very -- here 's what 's - his-name ! '
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 4]: Kit pledged him .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 55]: ` He lives in my house , ' said Dick ; ` at least in the house occupied by the firm in which I 'm a sort of a -- of a managing partner -- a difficult fellow to get anything out of , but we like him -- we like him . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 18]: I must be going , sir , if you please , ' said Kit , moving away .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 23]: ` Do n't be in a hurry , Christopher , ' replied his patron , ` we 'll drink your mother . '
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 7]: ` Thank you , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 16]: ` An excellent woman that mother of yours , Christopher , ' said Mr Swiveller .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 19]: ` Who ran to catch me when I fell , and kissed the place to make it well ?
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 3]: My mother .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 4]: A charming woman .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 8]: He 's a liberal sort of fellow .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 11]: We must get him to do something for your mother .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 8]: Does he know her , Christopher ? '
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 25]: Kit shook his head , and glancing slyly at his questioner , thanked him , and made off before he could say another word .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 4]: ` Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 10]: said Mr Swiveller pondering , ` this is queer .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 10]: Nothing but mysteries in connection with Brass 's house .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 9]: I 'll keep my own counsel , however .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 24]: Everybody and anybody has been in my confidence as yet , but now I think I 'll set up in business for myself .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 6]: Queer -- very queer ! '
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 83]: After pondering deeply and with a face of exceeding wisdom for some time , Mr Swiveller drank some more of the beer , and summoning a small boy who had been watching his proceedings , poured forth the few remaining drops as a libation on the gravel , and bade him carry the empty vessel to the bar with his compliments , and above all things to lead a sober and temperate life , and abstain from all intoxicating and exciting liquors .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 49]: Having given him this piece of moral advice for his trouble -LRB- which , as he wisely observed , was far better than half-pence -RRB- the Perpetual Grand Master of the Glorious Apollos thrust his hands into his pockets and sauntered away : still pondering as he went .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 125]: Chapter 39 All that day , though he waited for Mr Abel until evening , Kit kept clear of his mother 's house , determined not to anticipate the pleasures of the morrow , but to let them come in their full rush of delight ; for to-morrow was the great and long looked-for epoch in his life -- to-morrow was the end of his first quarter -- the day of receiving , for the first time , one fourth part of his annual income of Six Pounds in one vast sum of Thirty Shillings -- to-morrow was to be a half-holiday devoted to a whirl of entertainments , and little Jacob was to know what oysters meant , and to see a play .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 150]: All manner of incidents combined in favour of the occasion : not only had Mr and Mrs Garland forewarned him that they intended to make no deduction for his outfit from the great amount , but to pay it him unbroken in all its gigantic grandeur ; not only had the unknown gentleman increased the stock by the sum of five shillings , which was a perfect god-send and in itself a fortune ; not only had these things come to pass which nobody could have calculated upon , or in their wildest dreams have hoped ; but it was Barbara 's quarter too -- Barbara 's quarter , that very day -- and Barbara had a half-holiday as well as Kit , and Barbara 's mother was going to make one of the party , and to take tea with Kit 's mother , and cultivate her acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 75]: To be sure Kit looked out of his window very early that morning to see which way the clouds were flying , and to be sure Barbara would have been at hers too , if she had not sat up so late over-night , starching and ironing small pieces of muslin , and crimping them into frills , and sewing them on to other pieces to form magnificent wholes for next day 's wear .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 93]: But they were both up very early for all that , and had small appetites for breakfast and less for dinner , and were in a state of great excitement when Barbara 's mother came in , with astonishing accounts of the fineness of the weather out of doors -LRB- but with a very large umbrella notwithstanding , for people like Barbara 's mother seldom make holiday without one -RRB- , and when the bell rang for them to go up stairs and receive their quarter 's money in gold and silver .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 216]: Well , was n't Mr Garland kind when he said ` Christopher , here 's your money , and you have earned it well ; ' and was n't Mrs Garland kind when she said ` Barbara , here 's yours , and I 'm much pleased with you ; ' and did n't Kit sign his name bold to his receipt , and did n't Barbara sign her name all a trembling to hers ; and was n't it beautiful to see how Mrs Garland poured out Barbara 's mother a glass of wine ; and did n't Barbara 's mother speak up when she said ` Here 's blessing you , ma'am , as a good lady , and you , sir , as a good gentleman , and Barbara , my love to you , and here 's towards you , Mr Christopher ; ' and was n't she as long drinking it as if it had been a tumblerful ; and did n't she look genteel , standing there with her gloves on ; and was n't there plenty of laughing and talking among them as they reviewed all these things upon the top of the coach , and did n't they pity the people who had n't got a holiday !
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 27]: But Kit 's mother , again -- would n't anybody have supposed she had come of a good stock and been a lady all her life !
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 54]: There she was , quite ready to receive them , with a display of tea-things that might have warmed the heart of a china-shop ; and little Jacob and the baby in such a state of perfection that their clothes looked as good as new , though Heaven knows they were old enough !
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 107]: Did n't she say before they had sat down five minutes that Barbara 's mother was exactly the sort of lady she expected , and did n't Barbara 's mother say that Kit 's mother was the very picture of what she had expected , and did n't Kit 's mother compliment Barbara 's mother on Barbara , and did n't Barbara 's mother compliment Kit 's mother on Kit , and was n't Barbara herself quite fascinated with little Jacob , and did ever a child show off when he was wanted , as that child did , or make such friends as he made !
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 9]: ` And we are both widows too ! '
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 5]: said Barbara 's mother .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 13]: ` We must have been made to know each other . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 13]: I have n't a doubt about it , ' returned Mrs Nubbles .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 16]: ` And what a pity it is we did n't know each other sooner . '
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 40]: ` But then , you know , it 's such a pleasure , ' said Barbara 's mother , ` to have it brought about by one 's son and daughter , that it 's fully made up for .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 7]: Now , a n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 106]: To this , Kit 's mother yielded her full assent , and tracing things back from effects to causes , they naturally reverted to their deceased husbands , respecting whose lives , deaths , and burials , they compared notes , and discovered sundry circumstances that tallied with wonderful exactness ; such as Barbara 's father having been exactly four years and ten months older than Kit 's father , and one of them having died on a Wednesday and the other on a Thursday , and both of them having been of a very fine make and remarkably good-looking , with other extraordinary coincidences .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 41]: These recollections being of a kind calculated to cast a shadow on the brightness of the holiday , Kit diverted the conversation to general topics , and they were soon in great force again , and as merry as before .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 142]: Among other things , Kit told them about his old place , and the extraordinary beauty of Nell -LRB- of whom he had talked to Barbara a thousand times already -RRB- ; but the last-named circumstance failed to interest his hearers to anything like the extent he had supposed , and even his mother said -LRB- looking accidentally at Barbara at the same time -RRB- that there was no doubt Miss Nell was very pretty , but she was but a child after all , and there were many young women quite as pretty as she ; and Barbara mildly observed that she should think so , and that she never could help believing Mr Christopher must be under a mistake -- which Kit wondered at very much , not being able to conceive what reason she had for doubting him .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 97]: Barbara 's mother too , observed that it was very common for young folks to change at about fourteen or fifteen , and whereas they had been very pretty before , to grow up quite plain ; which truth she illustrated by many forcible examples , especially one of a young man , who , being a builder with great prospects , had been particular in his attentions to Barbara , but whom Barbara would have nothing to say to ; which -LRB- though everything happened for the best -RRB- she almost thought was a pity .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 41]: Kit said he thought so too , and so he did honestly , and he wondered what made Barbara so silent all at once , and why his mother looked at him as if he should n't have said it .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 64]: However , it was high time now to be thinking of the play ; for which great preparation was required , in the way of shawls and bonnets , not to mention one handkerchief full of oranges and another of apples , which took some time tying up , in consequence of the fruit having a tendency to roll out at the corners .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 82]: At length , everything was ready , and they went off very fast ; Kit 's mother carrying the baby , who was dreadfully wide awake , and Kit holding little Jacob in one hand , and escorting Barbara with the other -- a state of things which occasioned the two mothers , who walked behind , to declare that they looked quite family folks , and caused Barbara to blush and say , ` Now do n't , mother ! '
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 36]: But Kit said she had no call to mind what they said ; and indeed she need not have had , if she had known how very far from Kit 's thoughts any love-making was .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 3]: Poor Barbara !
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 96]: At last they got to the theatre , which was Astley 's : and in some two minutes after they had reached the yet unopened door , little Jacob was squeezed flat , and the baby had received divers concussions , and Barbara 's mother 's umbrella had been carried several yards off and passed back to her over the shoulders of the people , and Kit had hit a man on the head with the handkerchief of apples for ` scrowdging ' his parent with unnecessary violence , and there was a great uproar .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 78]: But , when they were once past the pay-place and tearing away for very life with their checks in their hands , and , above all , when they were fairly in the theatre , and seated in such places that they could n't have had better if they had picked them out , and taken them beforehand , all this was looked upon as quite a capital joke , and an essential part of the entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 90]: Dear , dear , what a place it looked , that Astley 's ; with all the paint , gilding , and looking-glass ; the vague smell of horses suggestive of coming wonders ; the curtain that hid such gorgeous mysteries ; the clean white sawdust down in the circus ; the company coming in and taking their places ; the fiddlers looking carelessly up at them while they tuned their instruments , as if they did n't want the play to begin , and knew it all beforehand !
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 58]: What a glow was that , which burst upon them all , when that long , clear , brilliant row of lights came slowly up ; and what the feverish excitement when the little bell rang and the music began in good earnest , with strong parts for the drums , and sweet effects for the triangles !
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 48]: Well might Barbara 's mother say to Kit 's mother that the gallery was the place to see from , and wonder it was n't much dearer than the boxes ; well might Barbara feel doubtful whether to laugh or cry , in her flutter of delight .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 5]: Then the play itself !
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 160]: the horses which little Jacob believed from the first to be alive , and the ladies and gentlemen of whose reality he could be by no means persuaded , having never seen or heard anything at all like them -- the firing , which made Barbara wink -- the forlorn lady , who made her cry -- the tyrant , who made her tremble -- the man who sang the song with the lady 's - maid and danced the chorus , who made her laugh -- the pony who reared up on his hind legs when he saw the murderer , and would n't hear of walking on all fours again until he was taken into custody -- the clown who ventured on such familiarities with the military man in boots -- the lady who jumped over the nine-and-twenty ribbons and came down safe upon the horse 's back -- everything was delightful , splendid , and surprising !
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 50]: Little Jacob applauded till his hands were sore ; Kit cried ` an-kor ' at the end of everything , the three-act piece included ; and Barbara 's mother beat her umbrella on the floor , in her ecstasies , until it was nearly worn down to the gingham .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 60]: In the midst of all these fascinations , Barbara 's thoughts seemed to have been still running on what Kit had said at tea-time ; for , when they were coming out of the play , she asked him , with an hysterical simper , if Miss Nell was as handsome as the lady who jumped over the ribbons .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 7]: ` As handsome as her ? '
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 3]: said Kit .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 6]: ` Double as handsome . '
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 4]: ` Oh Christopher !
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 15]: I 'm sure she was the beautifullest creature ever was , ' said Barbara .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 4]: ` Nonsense ! '
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 3]: returned Kit .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 28]: ` She was well enough , I do n't deny that ; but think how she was dressed and painted , and what a difference that made .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 14]: Why YOU are a good deal better looking than her , Barbara . '
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 5]: ` Oh Christopher ! '
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 6]: said Barbara , looking down .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 20]: ` You are , any day , ' said Kit , ' -- and so 's your mother . '
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 3]: Poor Barbara !
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 111]: What was all this though -- even all this -- to the extraordinary dissipation that ensued , when Kit , walking into an oyster-shop as bold as if he lived there , and not so much as looking at the counter or the man behind it , led his party into a box -- a private box , fitted up with red curtains , white table-cloth , and cruet-stand complete -- and ordered a fierce gentleman with whiskers , who acted as waiter and called him , him Christopher Nubbles , ` sir , ' to bring three dozen of his largest-sized oysters , and to look sharp about it !
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 48]: Yes , Kit told this gentleman to look sharp , and he not only said he would look sharp , but he actually did , and presently came running back with the newest loaves , and the freshest butter , and the largest oysters , ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 37]: Then said Kit to this gentleman , ' a pot of beer ' -- just so -- and the gentleman , instead of replying , ` Sir , did you address that language to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 11]: only said , ` Pot o ' beer , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 74]: Yes , sir , ' and went off and fetched it , and put it on the table in a small decanter-stand , like those which blind-men 's dogs carry about the streets in their mouths , to catch the half-pence in ; and both Kit 's mother and Barbara 's mother declared as he turned away that he was one of the slimmest and gracefullest young men she had ever looked upon .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 87]: Then they fell to work upon the supper in earnest ; and there was Barbara , that foolish Barbara , declaring that she could not eat more than two , and wanting more pressing than you would believe before she would eat four : though her mother and Kit 's mother made up for it pretty well , and ate and laughed and enjoyed themselves so thoroughly that it did Kit good to see them , and made him laugh and eat likewise from strong sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 51]: But the greatest miracle of the night was little Jacob , who ate oysters as if he had been born and bred to the business -- sprinkled the pepper and the vinegar with a discretion beyond his years -- and afterwards built a grotto on the table with the shells .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 86]: There was the baby too , who had never closed an eye all night , but had sat as good as gold , trying to force a large orange into his mouth , and gazing intently at the lights in the chandelier -- there he was , sitting up in his mother 's lap , staring at the gas without winking , and making indentations in his soft visage with an oyster-shell , to that degree that a heart of iron must have loved him !
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 47]: In short , there never was a more successful supper ; and when Kit ordered in a glass of something hot to finish with , and proposed Mr and Mrs Garland before sending it round , there were not six happier people in all the world .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 35]: But all happiness has an end -- hence the chief pleasure of its next beginning -- and as it was now growing late , they agreed it was time to turn their faces homewards .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 63]: So , after going a little out of their way to see Barbara and Barbara 's mother safe to a friend 's house where they were to pass the night , Kit and his mother left them at the door , with an early appointment for returning to Finchley next morning , and a great many plans for next quarter 's enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 32]: Then , Kit took little Jacob on his back , and giving his arm to his mother , and a kiss to the baby , they all trudged merrily home together .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 58]: Chapter 40 Full of that vague kind of penitence which holidays awaken next morning , Kit turned out at sunrise , and , with his faith in last night 's enjoyments a little shaken by cool daylight and the return to every-day duties and occupations , went to meet Barbara and her mother at the appointed place .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 77]: And being careful not to awaken any of the little household , who were yet resting from their unusual fatigues , Kit left his money on the chimney-piece , with an inscription in chalk calling his mother 's attention to the circumstance , and informing her that it came from her dutiful son ; and went his way , with a heart something heavier than his pockets , but free from any very great oppression notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 4]: Oh these holidays !
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 8]: why will they leave us some regret ?
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 45]: why can not we push them back , only a week or two in our memories , so as to put them at once at that convenient distance whence they may be regarded either with a calm indifference or a pleasant effort of recollection !
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 56]: why will they hang about us , like the flavour of yesterday 's wine , suggestive of headaches and lassitude , and those good intentions for the future , which , under the earth , form the everlasting pavement of a large estate , and , upon it , usually endure until dinner-time or thereabouts !
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 44]: Who will wonder that Barbara had a headache , or that Barbara 's mother was disposed to be cross , or that she slightly underrated Astley 's , and thought the clown was older than they had taken him to be last night ?
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 13]: Kit was not surprised to hear her say so -- not he .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 52]: He had already had a misgiving that the inconstant actors in that dazzling vision had been doing the same thing the night before last , and would do it again that night , and the next , and for weeks and months to come , though he would not be there .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 9]: Such is the difference between yesterday and today .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 14]: We are all going to the play , or coming home from it .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 23]: However , the Sun himself is weak when he first rises , and gathers strength and courage as the day gets on .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 50]: By degrees , they began to recall circumstances more and more pleasant in their nature , until , what between talking , walking , and laughing , they reached Finchley in such good heart , that Barbara 's mother declared she never felt less tired or in better spirits .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 5]: And so said Kit .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 14]: Barbara had been silent all the way , but she said so too .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 4]: Poor little Barbara !
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 5]: She was very quiet .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 53]: They were at home in such good time that Kit had rubbed down the pony and made him as spruce as a race-horse , before Mr Garland came down to breakfast ; which punctual and industrious conduct the old lady , and the old gentleman , and Mr Abel , highly extolled .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 48]: At his usual hour -LRB- or rather at his usual minute and second , for he was the soul of punctuality -RRB- Mr Abel walked out , to be overtaken by the London coach , and Kit and the old gentleman went to work in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 11]: This was not the least pleasant of Kit 's employments .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 69]: On a fine day they were quite a family party ; the old lady sitting hard by with her work-basket on a little table ; the old gentleman digging , or pruning , or clipping about with a large pair of shears , or helping Kit in some way or other with great assiduity ; and Whisker looking on from his paddock in placid contemplation of them all .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 51]: To-day they were to trim the grape-vine , so Kit mounted half-way up a short ladder , and began to snip and hammer away , while the old gentleman , with a great interest in his proceedings , handed up the nails and shreds of cloth as he wanted them .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 10]: The old lady and Whisker looked on as usual .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 24]: ` Well , Christopher , ' said Mr Garland , ` and so you have made a new friend , eh ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 8]: I beg your pardon , Sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 9]: returned Kit , looking down from the ladder .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 26]: ` You have made a new friend , I hear from Mr Abel , ' said the old gentleman , ` at the office ! '
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 5]: Yes Sir , yes .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 8]: He behaved very handsome , Sir . '
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 17]: ` I 'm glad to hear it , ' returned the old gentlemen with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 15]: ` He is disposed to behave more handsomely still , though , Christopher . '
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 5]: ` Indeed , Sir !
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 30]: It 's very kind in him , but I do n't want him to , I 'm sure , ' said Kit , hammering stoutly at an obdurate nail .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 38]: ` He is rather anxious , ' pursued the old gentleman , ` to have you in his own service -- take care what you 're doing , or you will fall down and hurt yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 11]: ` To have me in his service , Sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 21]: cried Kit , who had stopped short in his work and faced about on the ladder like some dexterous tumbler .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 20]: ` Why , Sir , I do n't think he can be in earnest when he says that . '
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 10]: But he is indeed , ' said Mr Garland .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 11]: ` And he has told Mr Abel so . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 9]: I never heard of such a thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 12]: muttered Kit , looking ruefully at his master and mistress . '
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 10]: I wonder at him ; that I do . '
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 33]: ` You see , Christopher , ' said Mr Garland , ` this is a point of much importance to you , and you should understand and consider it in that light .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 45]: This gentleman is able to give you more money than I -- not , I hope , to carry through the various relations of master and servant , more kindness and confidence , but certainly , Christopher , to give you more money . '
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 24]: ` Well , ' said Kit , ` after that , Sir -- ' ` Wait a moment , ' interposed Mr Garland .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 6]: ` That is not all .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 55]: You were a very faithful servant to your old employers , as I understand , and should this gentleman recover them , as it is his purpose to attempt doing by every means in his power , I have no doubt that you , being in his service , would meet with your reward .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 36]: Besides , ' added the old gentleman with stronger emphasis , ` besides having the pleasure of being again brought into communication with those to whom you seem to be very strongly and disinterestedly attached .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 20]: You must think of all this , Christopher , and not be rash or hasty in your choice . '
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 41]: Kit did suffer one twinge , one momentary pang , in keeping the resolution he had already formed , when this last argument passed swiftly into his thoughts , and conjured up the realization of all his hopes and fancies .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 33]: But it was gone in a minute , and he sturdily rejoined that the gentleman must look out for somebody else , as he did think he might have done at first .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 34]: ` He has no right to think that I 'd be led away to go to him , sir , ' said Kit , turning round again after half a minute 's hammering .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 10]: ` Does he think I 'm a fool ? '
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 20]: ` He may , perhaps , Christopher , if you refuse his offer , ' said Mr Garland gravely .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 23]: ` Then let him , sir , ' retorted Kit ; ` what do I care , sir , what he thinks ?
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 76]: why should I care for his thinking , sir , when I know that I should be a fool , and worse than a fool , sir , to leave the kindest master and mistress that ever was or can be , who took me out of the streets a very poor and hungry lad indeed -- poorer and hungrier perhaps than even you think for , sir -- to go to him or anybody ?
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 55]: If Miss Nell was to come back , ma'am , ' added Kit , turning suddenly to his mistress , ` why that would be another thing , and perhaps if she wanted me , I might ask you now and then to let me work for her when all was done at home .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 36]: But when she comes back , I see now that she 'll be rich as old master always said she would , and being a rich young lady , what could she want of me ?
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 42]: No , no , ' added Kit , shaking his head sorrowfully , ` she 'll never want me any more , and bless her , I hope she never may , though I should like to see her too ! '
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 27]: Here Kit drove a nail into the wall , very hard -- much harder than was necessary -- and having done so , faced about again .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 49]: ` There 's the pony , sir , ' said Kit -- ` Whisker , ma'am -LRB- and he knows so well I 'm talking about him that he begins to neigh directly , Sir -RRB- -- would he let anybody come near him but me , ma'am ?
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 13]: Here 's the garden , sir , and Mr Abel , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 23]: Would Mr Abel part with me , Sir , or is there anybody that could be fonder of the garden , ma'am ?
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 138]: It would break mother 's heart , Sir , and even little Jacob would have sense enough to cry his eyes out , ma'am , if he thought that Mr Abel could wish to part with me so soon , after having told me , only the other day , that he hoped we might be together for years to come -- ' There is no telling how long Kit might have stood upon the ladder , addressing his master and mistress by turns , and generally turning towards the wrong person , if Barbara had not at that moment come running up to say that a messenger from the office had brought a note , which , with an expression of some surprise at Kit 's oratorical appearance , she put into her master 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 18]: said the old gentleman after reading it , ` ask the messenger to walk this way . '
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 58]: Barbara tripping off to do as she was bid , he turned to Kit and said that they would not pursue the subject any further , and that Kit could not be more unwilling to part with them , than they would be to part with Kit ; a sentiment which the old lady very generously echoed .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 65]: ` At the same time , Christopher , ' added Mr Garland , glancing at the note in his hand , ` if the gentleman should want to borrow you now and then for an hour or so , or even a day or so , at a time , we must consent to lend you , and you must consent to be lent .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 3]: -- Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 6]: here is the young gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 8]: How do you do , Sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 33]: This salutation was addressed to Mr Chuckster , who , with his hat extremely on one side , and his hair a long way beyond it , came swaggering up the walk .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 13]: ` Hope I see you well sir , ' returned that gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 9]: ` Hope I see YOU well , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 7]: Charming box ' this , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 7]: Delicious country to be sure . '
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 14]: ` You want to take Kit back with you , I find ? '
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 5]: observed Mr Garland . '
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 15]: I have got a chariot-cab waiting on purpose , ' replied the clerk . '
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 19]: A very spanking grey in that cab , sir , if you 're a judge of horse-flesh . '
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 45]: Declining to inspect the spanking grey , on the plea that he was but poorly acquainted with such matters , and would but imperfectly appreciate his beauties , Mr Garland invited Mr Chuckster to partake of a slight repast in the way of lunch .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 22]: That gentleman readily consenting , certain cold viands , flanked with ale and wine , were speedily prepared for his refreshment .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 60]: At this repast , Mr Chuckster exerted his utmost abilities to enchant his entertainers , and impress them with a conviction of the mental superiority of those who dwelt in town ; with which view he led the discourse to the small scandal of the day , in which he was justly considered by his friends to shine prodigiously .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 135]: Thus , he was in a condition to relate the exact circumstances of the difference between the Marquis of Mizzler and Lord Bobby , which it appeared originated in a disputed bottle of champagne , and not in a pigeon-pie , as erroneously reported in the newspapers ; neither had Lord Bobby said to the Marquis of Mizzler , ` Mizzler , one of us two tells a lie , and I 'm not the man , ' as incorrectly stated by the same authorities ; but ` Mizzler , you know where I 'm to be found , and damme , sir , find me if you want me ' -- which , of course , entirely changed the aspect of this interesting question , and placed it in a very different light .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 81]: He also acquainted them with the precise amount of the income guaranteed by the Duke of Thigsberry to Violetta Stetta of the Italian Opera , which it appeared was payable quarterly , and not half-yearly , as the public had been given to understand , and which was EXclusive , and not INclusive -LRB- as had been monstrously stated , -RRB- of jewellery , perfumery , hair-powder for five footmen , and two daily changes of kid-gloves for a page .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 71]: Having entreated the old lady and gentleman to set their minds at rest on these absorbing points , for they might rely on his statement being the correct one , Mr Chuckster entertained them with theatrical chit-chat and the court circular ; and so wound up a brilliant and fascinating conversation which he had maintained alone , and without any assistance whatever , for upwards of three-quarters of an hour .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 33]: ` And now that the nag has got his wind again , ' said Mr Chuckster rising in a graceful manner , ` I 'm afraid I must cut my stick . '
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 86]: Neither Mr nor Mrs Garland offered any opposition to his tearing himself away -LRB- feeling , no doubt , that such a man could ill be spared from his proper sphere of action -RRB- , and therefore Mr Chuckster and Kit were shortly afterwards upon their way to town ; Kit being perched upon the box of the cabriolet beside the driver , and Mr Chuckster seated in solitary state inside , with one of his boots sticking out at each of the front windows .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 45]: When they reached the Notary 's house , Kit followed into the office , and was desired by Mr Abel to sit down and wait , for the gentleman who wanted him had gone out , and perhaps might not return for some time .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 69]: This anticipation was strictly verified , for Kit had had his dinner , and his tea , and had read all the lighter matter in the Law -- List , and the Post -- Office Directory , and had fallen asleep a great many times , before the gentleman whom he had seen before , came in ; which he did at last in a very great hurry .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 42]: He was closeted with Mr Witherden for some little time , and Mr Abel had been called in to assist at the conference , before Kit , wondering very much what he was wanted for , was summoned to attend them .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 29]: ` Christopher , ' said the gentleman , turning to him directly he entered the room , ' I have found your old master and young mistress . '
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 5]: ` No , Sir !
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 6]: Have you , though ? '
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 9]: returned Kit , his eyes sparkling with delight .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 7]: ` Where are they , Sir ?
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 6]: How are they , Sir ?
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 10]: Are they -- are they near here ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 15]: A long way from here , ' returned the gentleman , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 22]: ` But I am going away to-night to bring them back , and I want you to go with me . '
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 6]: ` Me , Sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 9]: cried Kit , full of joy and surprise .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 36]: ` The place , ' said the strange gentleman , turning thoughtfully to the Notary , ` indicated by this man of the dogs , is -- how far from here -- sixty miles ? '
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 7]: ` From sixty to seventy . '
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 3]: ` Humph !
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 17]: If we travel post all night , we shall reach there in good time to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 67]: Now , the only question is , as they will not know me , and the child , God bless her , would think that any stranger pursuing them had a design upon her grandfather 's liberty -- can I do better than take this lad , whom they both know and will readily remember , as an assurance to them of my friendly intentions ? '
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 9]: ` Certainly not , ' replied the Notary .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 9]: ` Take Christopher by all means . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 109]: I beg your pardon , Sir , ' said Kit , who had listened to this discourse with a lengthening countenance , ` but if that 's the reason , I 'm afraid I should do more harm than good -- Miss Nell , Sir , she knows me , and would trust in me , I am sure ; but old master -- I do n't know why , gentlemen ; nobody does -- would not bear me in his sight after he had been ill , and Miss Nell herself told me that I must not go near him or let him see me any more .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 16]: I should spoil all that you were doing if I went , I 'm afraid .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 19]: I 'd give the world to go , but you had better not take me , Sir . '
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 5]: ` Another difficulty ! '
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 5]: cried the impetuous gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 9]: ` Was ever man so beset as I ?
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 17]: Is there nobody else that knew them , nobody else in whom they had any confidence ?
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 18]: Solitary as their lives were , is there no one person who would serve my purpose ? '
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 7]: ` IS there , Christopher ? '
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 4]: said the Notary .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 10]: ` Not one , Sir , ' replied Kit .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 12]: -- ` Yes , though -- there 's my mother . '
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 7]: ` Did they know her ? '
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 5]: said the single gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 6]: ` Know her , Sir !
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 10]: why , she was always coming backwards and forwards .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 12]: They were as kind to her as they were to me .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 16]: Bless you , Sir , she expected they 'd come back to her house . '
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 10]: ` Then where the devil is the woman ? '
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 10]: said the impatient gentleman , catching up his hat .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 7]: ` Why is n't she here ?
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 16]: Why is that woman always out of the way when she is most wanted ? '
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 92]: In a word , the single gentleman was bursting out of the office , bent upon laying violent hands on Kit 's mother , forcing her into a post-chaise , and carrying her off , when this novel kind of abduction was with some difficulty prevented by the joint efforts of Mr Abel and the Notary , who restrained him by dint of their remonstrances , and persuaded him to sound Kit upon the probability of her being able and willing to undertake such a journey on so short a notice .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 36]: This occasioned some doubts on the part of Kit , and some violent demonstrations on that of the single gentleman , and a great many soothing speeches on that of the Notary and Mr Abel .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 72]: The upshot of the business was , that Kit , after weighing the matter in his mind and considering it carefully , promised , on behalf of his mother , that she should be ready within two hours from that time to undertake the expedition , and engaged to produce her in that place , in all respects equipped and prepared for the journey , before the specified period had expired .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 35]: Having given this pledge , which was rather a bold one , and not particularly easy of redemption , Kit lost no time in sallying forth , and taking measures for its immediate fulfilment .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 66]: Chapter 41 Kit made his way through the crowded streets , dividing the stream of people , dashing across the busy road-ways , diving into lanes and alleys , and stopping or turning aside for nothing , until he came in front of the Old Curiosity Shop , when he came to a stand ; partly from habit and partly from being out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 24]: It was a gloomy autumn evening , and he thought the old place had never looked so dismal as in its dreary twilight .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 75]: The windows broken , the rusty sashes rattling in their frames , the deserted house a dull barrier dividing the glaring lights and bustle of the street into two long lines , and standing in the midst , cold , dark , and empty -- presented a cheerless spectacle which mingled harshly with the bright prospects the boy had been building up for its late inmates , and came like a disappointment or misfortune .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 44]: Kit would have had a good fire roaring up the empty chimneys , lights sparkling and shining through the windows , people moving briskly to and fro , voices in cheerful conversation , something in unison with the new hopes that were astir .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 50]: He had not expected that the house would wear any different aspect -- had known indeed that it could not -- but coming upon it in the midst of eager thoughts and expectations , it checked the current in its flow , and darkened it with a mournful shadow .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 54]: Kit , however , fortunately for himself , was not learned enough or contemplative enough to be troubled with presages of evil afar off , and , having no mental spectacles to assist his vision in this respect , saw nothing but the dull house , which jarred uncomfortably upon his previous thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 35]: So , almost wishing that he had not passed it , though hardly knowing why , he hurried on again , making up by his increased speed for the few moments he had lost .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 42]: ` Now , if she should be out , ' thought Kit , as he approached the poor dwelling of his mother , ` and I not able to find her , this impatient gentleman would be in a pretty taking .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 14]: And sure enough there 's no light , and the door 's fast .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 40]: Now , God forgive me for saying so , but if this is Little Bethel 's doing , I wish Little Bethel was -- was farther off , ' said Kit checking himself , and knocking at the door .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 31]: A second knock brought no reply from within the house ; but caused a woman over the way to look out and inquire who that was , awanting Mrs Nubbles .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 7]: ` Me , ' said Kit .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 13]: ` She 's at -- at Little Bethel , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 22]: -- getting out the name of the obnoxious conventicle with some reluctance , and laying a spiteful emphasis upon the words .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 5]: The neighbour nodded assent .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 38]: ` Then pray tell me where it is , ' said Kit , ` for I have come on a pressing matter , and must fetch her out , even if she was in the pulpit . '
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 39]: It was not very easy to procure a direction to the fold in question , as none of the neighbours were of the flock that resorted thither , and few knew anything more of it than the name .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 49]: At last , a gossip of Mrs Nubbles 's , who had accompanied her to chapel on one or two occasions when a comfortable cup of tea had preceded her devotions , furnished the needful information , which Kit had no sooner obtained than he started off again .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 68]: Little Bethel might have been nearer , and might have been in a straighter road , though in that case the reverend gentleman who presided over its congregation would have lost his favourite allusion to the crooked ways by which it was approached , and which enabled him to liken it to Paradise itself , in contradistinction to the parish church and the broad thoroughfare leading thereunto .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 32]: Kit found it , at last , after some trouble , and pausing at the door to take breath that he might enter with becoming decency , passed into the chapel .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 106]: It was not badly named in one respect , being in truth a particularly little Bethel -- a Bethel of the smallest dimensions -- with a small number of small pews , and a small pulpit , in which a small gentleman -LRB- by trade a Shoemaker , and by calling a Divine -RRB- was delivering in a by no means small voice , a by no means small sermon , judging of its dimensions by the condition of his audience , which , if their gross amount were but small , comprised a still smaller number of hearers , as the majority were slumbering .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 89]: Among these was Kit 's mother , who , finding it matter of extreme difficulty to keep her eyes open after the fatigues of last night , and feeling their inclination to close strongly backed and seconded by the arguments of the preacher , had yielded to the drowsiness that overpowered her , and fallen asleep ; though not so soundly but that she could , from time to time , utter a slight and almost inaudible groan , as if in recognition of the orator 's doctrines .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 68]: The baby in her arms was as fast asleep as she ; and little Jacob , whose youth prevented him from recognising in this prolonged spiritual nourishment anything half as interesting as oysters , was alternately very fast asleep and very wide awake , as his inclination to slumber , or his terror of being personally alluded to in the discourse , gained the mastery over him .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 51]: ` And now I 'm here , ' thought Kit , gliding into the nearest empty pew which was opposite his mother 's , and on the other side of the little aisle , ` how am I ever to get at her , or persuade her to come out !
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 9]: I might as well be twenty miles off .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 17]: She 'll never wake till it 's all over , and there goes the clock again !
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 18]: If he would but leave off for a minute , or if they 'd only sing ! '
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 20]: But there was little encouragement to believe that either event would happen for a couple of hours to come .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 46]: The preacher went on telling them what he meant to convince them of before he had done , and it was clear that if he only kept to one-half of his promises and forgot the other , he was good for that time at least .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 42]: In his desperation and restlessness Kit cast his eyes about the chapel , and happening to let them fall upon a little seat in front of the clerk 's desk , could scarcely believe them when they showed him -- Quilp !
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 58]: He rubbed them twice or thrice , but still they insisted that Quilp was there , and there indeed he was , sitting with his hands upon his knees , and his hat between them on a little wooden bracket , with the accustomed grin on his dirty face , and his eyes fixed upon the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 47]: He certainly did not glance at Kit or at his mother , and appeared utterly unconscious of their presence ; still Kit could not help feeling , directly , that the attention of the sly little fiend was fastened upon them , and upon nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 67]: But , astounded as he was by the apparition of the dwarf among the Little Bethelites , and not free from a misgiving that it was the forerunner of some trouble or annoyance , he was compelled to subdue his wonder and to take active measures for the withdrawal of his parent , as the evening was now creeping on , and the matter grew serious .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 42]: Therefore , the next time little Jacob woke , Kit set himself to attract his wandering attention , and this not being a very difficult task -LRB- one sneeze effected it -RRB- , he signed to him to rouse his mother .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 124]: Ill-luck would have it , however , that , just then , the preacher , in a forcible exposition of one head of his discourse , leaned over upon the pulpit-desk so that very little more of him than his legs remained inside ; and , while he made vehement gestures with his right hand , and held on with his left , stared , or seemed to stare , straight into little Jacob 's eyes , threatening him by his strained look and attitude -- so it appeared to the child -- that if he so much as moved a muscle , he , the preacher , would be literally , and not figuratively , ` down upon him ' that instant .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 62]: In this fearful state of things , distracted by the sudden appearance of Kit , and fascinated by the eyes of the preacher , the miserable Jacob sat bolt upright , wholly incapable of motion , strongly disposed to cry but afraid to do so , and returning his pastor 's gaze until his infant eyes seemed starting from their sockets .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 15]: ` If I must do it openly , I must , ' thought Kit .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 38]: With that he walked softly out of his pew and into his mother 's , and as Mr Swiveller would have observed if he had been present , ` collared ' the baby without speaking a word .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 6]: ` Hush , mother ! '
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 3]: whispered Kit .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 15]: ` Come along with me , I 've got something to tell you . '
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 6]: ` Where am I ? '
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 4]: said Mrs Nubbles .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 14]: ` In this blessed Little Bethel , ' returned her son , peevishly .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 5]: ` Blessed indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 9]: cried Mrs Nubbles , catching at the word .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 14]: ` Oh , Christopher , how have I been edified this night ! '
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 26]: ` Yes , yes , I know , ' said Kit hastily ; ` but come along , mother , everybody 's looking at us .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 14]: Do n't make a noise -- bring Jacob -- that 's right ! '
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 8]: ` Stay , Satan , stay ! '
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 10]: cried the preacher , as Kit was moving off .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 16]: ` This gentleman says you 're to stay , Christopher , ' whispered his mother .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 8]: ` Stay , Satan , stay ! '
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 5]: roared the preacher again .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 23]: ` Tempt not the woman that doth incline her ear to thee , but harken to the voice of him that calleth .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 9]: He hath a lamb from the fold ! '
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 15]: cried the preacher , raising his voice still higher and pointing to the baby .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 11]: ` He beareth off a lamb , a precious lamb !
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 19]: He goeth about , like a wolf in the night season , and inveigleth the tender lambs ! '
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 52]: Kit was the best-tempered fellow in the world , but considering this strong language , and being somewhat excited by the circumstances in which he was placed , he faced round to the pulpit with the baby in his arms , and replied aloud , ` No , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 6]: He 's my brother . '
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 7]: ` He 's MY brother ! '
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 4]: cried the preacher .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 10]: ` He is n't , ' said Kit indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 9]: ` How can you say such a thing ?
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 16]: And do n't call me names if you please ; what harm have I done ?
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 21]: I should n't have come to take 'em away , unless I was obliged , you may depend upon that .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 15]: I wanted to do it very quiet , but you would n't let me .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 30]: Now , you have the goodness to abuse Satan and them , as much as you like , Sir , and to let me alone if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 76]: So saying , Kit marched out of the chapel , followed by his mother and little Jacob , and found himself in the open air , with an indistinct recollection of having seen the people wake up and look surprised , and of Quilp having remained , throughout the interruption , in his old attitude , without moving his eyes from the ceiling , or appearing to take the smallest notice of anything that passed .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 5]: ` Oh Kit ! '
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 17]: said his mother , with her handkerchief to her eyes , ` what have you done !
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 10]: I never can go there again -- never ! '
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 9]: ` I 'm glad of it , mother .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 26]: What was there in the little bit of pleasure you took last night that made it necessary for you to be low-spirited and sorrowful tonight ?
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 7]: That 's the way you do .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 26]: If you 're happy or merry ever , you come here to say , along with that chap , that you 're sorry for it .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 14]: More shame for you , mother , I was going to say . '
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 6]: ` Hush , dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 22]: said Mrs Nubbles ; ` you do n't mean what you say I know , but you 're talking sinfulness . '
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 6]: ` Do n't mean it ?
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 7]: But I do mean it ! '
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 4]: retorted Kit . '
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 54]: I do n't believe , mother , that harmless cheerfulness and good humour are thought greater sins in Heaven than shirt-collars are , and I do believe that those chaps are just about as right and sensible in putting down the one as in leaving off the other -- that 's my belief .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 73]: But I wo n't say anything more about it , if you 'll promise not to cry , that 's all ; and you take the baby that 's a lighter weight , and give me little Jacob ; and as we go along -LRB- which we must do pretty quick -RRB- I 'll give you the news I bring , which will surprise you a little , I can tell you .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 6]: There -- that 's right .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 121]: Now you look as if you 'd never seen Little Bethel in all your life , as I hope you never will again ; and here 's the baby ; and little Jacob , you get atop of my back and catch hold of me tight round the neck , and whenever a Little Bethel parson calls you a precious lamb or says your brother 's one , you tell him it 's the truest things he 's said for a twelvemonth , and that if he 'd got a little more of the lamb himself , and less of the mint-sauce -- not being quite so sharp and sour over it -- I should like him all the better .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 14]: That 's what you 've got to say to him , Jacob . '
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 78]: Talking on in this way , half in jest and half in earnest , and cheering up his mother , the children , and himself , by the one simple process of determining to be in a good humour , Kit led them briskly forward ; and on the road home , he related what had passed at the Notary 's house , and the purpose with which he had intruded on the solemnities of Little Bethel .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 58]: His mother was not a little startled on learning what service was required of her , and presently fell into a confusion of ideas , of which the most prominent were that it was a great honour and dignity to ride in a post-chaise , and that it was a moral impossibility to leave the children behind .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 68]: But this objection , and a great many others , founded on certain articles of dress being at the wash , and certain other articles having no existence in the wardrobe of Mrs Nubbles , were overcome by Kit , who opposed to each and every of them , the pleasure of recovering Nell , and the delight it would be to bring her back in triumph .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 18]: ` There 's only ten minutes now , mother , ' said Kit when they reached home .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 6]: ` There 's a bandbox .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 14]: Throw in what you want , and we 'll be off directly . '
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 117]: To tell how Kit then hustled into the box all sorts of things which could , by no remote contingency , be wanted , and how he left out everything likely to be of the smallest use ; how a neighbour was persuaded to come and stop with the children , and how the children at first cried dismally , and then laughed heartily on being promised all kinds of impossible and unheard-of toys ; how Kit 's mother would n't leave off kissing them , and how Kit could n't make up his mind to be vexed with her for doing it ; would take more time and room than you and I can spare .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 43]: So , passing over all such matters , it is sufficient to say that within a few minutes after the two hours had expired , Kit and his mother arrived at the Notary 's door , where a post-chaise was already waiting .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 8]: ` With four horses I declare ! '
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 9]: said Kit , quite aghast at the preparations .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 11]: ` Well you ARE going to do it , mother !
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 6]: Here she is , Sir .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 5]: Here 's my mother .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 8]: She 's quite ready , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 10]: ` That 's well , ' returned the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 20]: ` Now , do n't be in a flutter , ma'am ; you 'll be taken great care of .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 14]: Where 's the box with the new clothing and necessaries for them ? '
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 10]: ` Here it is , ' said the Notary .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 8]: ` In with it , Christopher . '
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 10]: ` All right , Sir , ' replied Kit .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 8]: ` Quite ready now , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 11]: ` Then come along , ' said the single gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 29]: And thereupon he gave his arm to Kit 's mother , handed her into the carriage as politely as you please , and took his seat beside her .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 54]: Up went the steps , bang went the door , round whirled the wheels , and off they rattled , with Kit 's mother hanging out at one window waving a damp pocket-handkerchief and screaming out a great many messages to little Jacob and the baby , of which nobody heard a word .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 38]: Kit stood in the middle of the road , and looked after them with tears in his eyes -- not brought there by the departure he witnessed , but by the return to which he looked forward .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 51]: ` They went away , ' he thought , ` on foot with nobody to speak to them or say a kind word at parting , and they 'll come back , drawn by four horses , with this rich gentleman for their friend , and all their troubles over !
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 83]: She 'll forget that she taught me to write -- ' Whatever Kit thought about after this , took some time to think of , for he stood gazing up the lines of shining lamps , long after the chaise had disappeared , and did not return into the house until the Notary and Mr Abel , who had themselves lingered outside till the sound of the wheels was no longer distinguishable , had several times wondered what could possibly detain him .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 43]: Chapter 42 It behoves us to leave Kit for a while , thoughtful and expectant , and to follow the fortunes of little Nell ; resuming the thread of the narrative at the point where it was left , some chapters back .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 199]: In one of those wanderings in the evening time , when , following the two sisters at a humble distance , she felt , in her sympathy with them and her recognition in their trials of something akin to her own loneliness of spirit , a comfort and consolation which made such moments a time of deep delight , though the softened pleasure they yielded was of that kind which lives and dies in tears -- in one of those wanderings at the quiet hour of twilight , when sky , and earth , and air , and rippling water , and sound of distant bells , claimed kindred with the emotions of the solitary child , and inspired her with soothing thoughts , but not of a child 's world or its easy joys -- in one of those rambles which had now become her only pleasure or relief from care , light had faded into darkness and evening deepened into night , and still the young creature lingered in the gloom ; feeling a companionship in Nature so serene and still , when noise of tongues and glare of garish lights would have been solitude indeed .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 11]: The sisters had gone home , and she was alone .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 73]: She raised her eyes to the bright stars , looking down so mildly from the wide worlds of air , and , gazing on them , found new stars burst upon her view , and more beyond , and more beyond again , until the whole great expanse sparkled with shining spheres , rising higher and higher in immeasurable space , eternal in their numbers as in their changeless and incorruptible existence .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 45]: She bent over the calm river , and saw them shining in the same majestic order as when the dove beheld them gleaming through the swollen waters , upon the mountain tops down far below , and dead mankind , a million fathoms deep .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 26]: The child sat silently beneath a tree , hushed in her very breath by the stillness of the night , and all its attendant wonders .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 37]: The time and place awoke reflection , and she thought with a quiet hope -- less hope , perhaps , than resignation -- on the past , and present , and what was yet before her .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 21]: Between the old man and herself there had come a gradual separation , harder to bear than any former sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 60]: Every evening , and often in the day-time too , he was absent , alone ; and although she well knew where he went , and why -- too well from the constant drain upon her scanty purse and from his haggard looks -- he evaded all inquiry , maintained a strict reserve , and even shunned her presence .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 29]: She sat meditating sorrowfully upon this change , and mingling it , as it were , with everything about her , when the distant church-clock bell struck nine .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 17]: Rising at the sound , she retraced her steps , and turned thoughtfully towards the town .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 76]: She had gained a little wooden bridge , which , thrown across the stream , led into a meadow in her way , when she came suddenly upon a ruddy light , and looking forward more attentively , discerned that it proceeded from what appeared to be an encampment of gipsies , who had made a fire in one corner at no great distance from the path , and were sitting or lying round it .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 48]: As she was too poor to have any fear of them , she did not alter her course -LRB- which , indeed , she could not have done without going a long way round -RRB- , but quickened her pace a little , and kept straight on .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 20]: A movement of timid curiosity impelled her , when she approached the spot , to glance towards the fire .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 24]: There was a form between it and her , the outline strongly developed against the light , which caused her to stop abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 39]: Then , as if she had reasoned with herself and were assured that it could not be , or had satisfied herself that it was not that of the person she had supposed , she went on again .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 46]: But at that instant the conversation , whatever it was , which had been carrying on near this fire was resumed , and the tones of the voice that spoke -- she could not distinguish words -- sounded as familiar to her as her own .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 7]: She turned , and looked back .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 28]: The person had been seated before , but was now in a standing posture , and leaning forward on a stick on which he rested both hands .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 16]: The attitude was no less familiar to her than the tone of voice had been .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 5]: It was her grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 27]: Her first impulse was to call to him ; her next to wonder who his associates could be , and for what purpose they were together .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 39]: Some vague apprehension succeeded , and , yielding to the strong inclination it awakened , she drew nearer to the place ; not advancing across the open field , however , but creeping towards it by the hedge .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 34]: In this way she advanced within a few feet of the fire , and standing among a few young trees , could both see and hear , without much danger of being observed .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 81]: There were no women or children , as she had seen in other gipsy camps they had passed in their wayfaring , and but one gipsy -- a tall athletic man , who stood with his arms folded , leaning against a tree at a little distance off , looking now at the fire , and now , under his black eyelashes , at three other men who were there , with a watchful but half-concealed interest in their conversation .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 41]: Of these , her grandfather was one ; the others she recognised as the first card-players at the public-house on the eventful night of the storm -- the man whom they had called Isaac List , and his gruff companion .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 30]: One of the low , arched gipsy-tents , common to that people , was pitched hard by , but it either was , or appeared to be , empty .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 8]: ` Well , are you going ? '
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 24]: said the stout man , looking up from the ground where he was lying at his ease , into her grandfather 's face .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 11]: ` You were in a mighty hurry a minute ago .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 6]: Go , if you like .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 10]: You 're your own master , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 49]: ` Do n't vex him , ' returned Isaac List , who was squatting like a frog on the other side of the fire , and had so screwed himself up that he seemed to be squinting all over ; ` he did n't mean any offence . '
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 33]: ` You keep me poor , and plunder me , and make a sport and jest of me besides , ' said the old man , turning from one to the other .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 10]: ` Ye 'll drive me mad among ye . '
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 33]: The utter irresolution and feebleness of the grey-haired child , contrasted with the keen and cunning looks of those in whose hands he was , smote upon the little listener 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 19]: But she constrained herself to attend to all that passed , and to note each look and word .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 10]: ` Confound you , what do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 15]: said the stout man rising a little , and supporting himself on his elbow .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 5]: ` Keep you poor !
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 13]: You 'd keep us poor if you could , would n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 13]: That 's the way with you whining , puny , pitiful players .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 28]: When you lose , you 're martyrs ; but I do n't find that when you win , you look upon the other losers in that light .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 5]: As to plunder ! '
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 25]: cried the fellow , raising his voice -- ` Damme , what do you mean by such ungentlemanly language as plunder , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 30]: The speaker laid himself down again at full length , and gave one or two short , angry kicks , as if in further expression of his unbounded indignation .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 67]: It was quite plain that he acted the bully , and his friend the peacemaker , for some particular purpose ; or rather , it would have been to any one but the weak old man ; for they exchanged glances quite openly , both with each other and with the gipsy , who grinned his approval of the jest until his white teeth shone again .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 34]: The old man stood helplessly among them for a little time , and then said , turning to his assailant : ` You yourself were speaking of plunder just now , you know .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 8]: Do n't be so violent with me .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 8]: You were , were you not ? '
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 8]: ` Not of plundering among present company !
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 28]: Honour among -- among gentlemen , Sir , ' returned the other , who seemed to have been very near giving an awkward termination to the sentence .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 15]: ` Do n't be hard upon him , Jowl , ' said Isaac List .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 9]: ` He 's very sorry for giving offence .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 14]: There -- go on with what you were saying -- go on . '
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 50]: ` I 'm a jolly old tender-hearted lamb , I am , ' cried Mr Jowl , ` to be sitting here at my time of life giving advice when I know it wo n't be taken , and that I shall get nothing but abuse for my pains .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 11]: But that 's the way I 've gone through life .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 12]: Experience has never put a chill upon my warm-heartedness . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 13]: I tell you he 's very sorry , do n't I ? '
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 15]: remonstrated Isaac List , ` and that he wishes you 'd go on . '
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 7]: ` Does he wish it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 4]: said the other .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 18]: ` Ay , ' groaned the old man sitting down , and rocking himself to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 7]: ` Go on , go on .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 20]: It 's in vain to fight with it ; I ca n't do it ; go on . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 22]: I go on then , ' said Jowl , ` where I left off , when you got up so quick .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 71]: If you 're persuaded that it 's time for luck to turn , as it certainly is , and find that you have n't means enough to try it -LRB- and that 's where it is , for you know , yourself , that you never have the funds to keep on long enough at a sitting -RRB- , help yourself to what seems put in your way on purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 19]: Borrow it , I say , and , when you 're able , pay it back again . '
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 71]: ` Certainly , ' Isaac List struck in , ` if this good lady as keeps the wax-works has money , and does keep it in a tin box when she goes to bed , and does n't lock her door for fear of fire , it seems a easy thing ; quite a Providence , I should call it -- but then I 've been religiously brought up . '
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 100]: ` You see , Isaac , ' said his friend , growing more eager , and drawing himself closer to the old man , while he signed to the gipsy not to come between them ; ` you see , Isaac , strangers are going in and out every hour of the day ; nothing would be more likely than for one of these strangers to get under the good lady 's bed , or lock himself in the cupboard ; suspicion would be very wide , and would fall a long way from the mark , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 19]: I 'd give him his revenge to the last farthing he brought , whatever the amount was . '
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 6]: ` But could you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 4]: urged Isaac List .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 8]: ` Is your bank strong enough ? '
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 5]: ` Strong enough ! '
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 8]: answered the other , with assumed disdain .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 16]: ` Here , you Sir , give me that box out of the straw ! '
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 44]: This was addressed to the gipsy , who crawled into the low tent on all fours , and after some rummaging and rustling returned with a cash-box , which the man who had spoken opened with a key he wore about his person .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 7]: ` Do you see this ? '
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 26]: he said , gathering up the money in his hand and letting it drop back into the box , between his fingers , like water .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 6]: ` Do you hear it ?
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 8]: Do you know the sound of gold ?
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 26]: There , put it back -- and do n't talk about banks again , Isaac , till you 've got one of your own . '
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 112]: Isaac List , with great apparent humility , protested that he had never doubted the credit of a gentleman so notorious for his honourable dealing as Mr Jowl , and that he had hinted at the production of the box , not for the satisfaction of his doubts , for he could have none , but with a view to being regaled with a sight of so much wealth , which , though it might be deemed by some but an unsubstantial and visionary pleasure , was to one in his circumstances a source of extreme delight , only to be surpassed by its safe depository in his own personal pockets .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 71]: Although Mr List and Mr Jowl addressed themselves to each other , it was remarkable that they both looked narrowly at the old man , who , with his eyes fixed upon the fire , sat brooding over it , yet listening eagerly -- as it seemed from a certain involuntary motion of the head , or twitching of the face from time to time -- to all they said .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 28]: ` My advice , ' said Jowl , lying down again with a careless air , ` is plain -- I have given it , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 6]: I act as a friend .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 23]: Why should I help a man to the means perhaps of winning all I have , unless I considered him my friend ?
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 43]: It 's foolish , I dare say , to be so thoughtful of the welfare of other people , but that 's my constitution , and I ca n't help it ; so do n't blame me , Isaac List . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 5]: I blame you ! '
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 14]: returned the person addressed ; ` not for the world , Mr Jowl .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 49]: I wish I could afford to be as liberal as you ; and , as you say , he might pay it back if he won -- and if he lost -- ' ` You 're not to take that into consideration at all , ' said Jowl .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 40]: ` But suppose he did -LRB- and nothing 's less likely , from all I know of chances -RRB- , why , it 's better to lose other people 's money than one 's own , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 11]: cried Isaac List rapturously , ` the pleasures of winning !
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 22]: The delight of picking up the money -- the bright , shining yellow-boys -- and sweeping 'em into one 's pocket !
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 28]: The deliciousness of having a triumph at last , and thinking that one did n't stop short and turn back , but went half-way to meet it !
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 12]: The -- but you 're not going , old gentleman ? '
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 30]: ` I 'll do it , ' said the old man , who had risen and taken two or three hurried steps away , and now returned as hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 10]: ` I 'll have it , every penny . '
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 33]: ` Why , that 's brave , ' cried Isaac , jumping up and slapping him on the shoulder ; ` and I respect you for having so much young blood left .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 10]: Joe Jowl 's half sorry he advised you now .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 8]: We 've got the laugh against him .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 7]: Ha , ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 48]: ` He gives me my revenge , mind , ' said the old man , pointing to him eagerly with his shrivelled hand : ` mind -- he stakes coin against coin , down to the last one in the box , be there many or few .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 4]: Remember that ! '
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 9]: ` I 'm witness , ' returned Isaac .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 10]: ` I 'll see fair between you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 20]: I have passed my word , ' said Jowl with feigned reluctance , ` and I 'll keep it .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 7]: When does this match come off ?
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 6]: I wish it was over .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 5]: -- To-night ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 28]: I must have the money first , ' said the old man ; ` and that I 'll have to-morrow -- ' ` Why not to-night ? '
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 3]: urged Jowl .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 20]: ` It 's late now , and I should be flushed and flurried , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 7]: ` It must be softly done .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 6]: No , to-morrow night . '
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 11]: ` Then to-morrow be it , ' said Jowl . '
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 6]: A drop of comfort here .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 6]: Luck to the best man !
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 3]: Fill ! '
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 16]: The gipsy produced three tin cups , and filled them to the brim with brandy .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 13]: The old man turned aside and muttered to himself before he drank .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 29]: Her own name struck upon the listener 's ear , coupled with some wish so fervent , that he seemed to breathe it in an agony of supplication .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 8]: ` God be merciful to us ! '
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 15]: cried the child within herself , ` and help us in this trying hour !
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 9]: What shall I do to save him ! '
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 37]: The remainder of their conversation was carried on in a lower tone of voice , and was sufficiently concise ; relating merely to the execution of the project , and the best precautions for diverting suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 13]: The old man then shook hands with his tempters , and withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 37]: They watched his bowed and stooping figure as it retreated slowly , and when he turned his head to look back , which he often did , waved their hands , or shouted some brief encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 32]: It was not until they had seen him gradually diminish into a mere speck upon the distant road , that they turned to each other , and ventured to laugh aloud .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 21]: ` So , ' said Jowl , warming his hands at the fire , ` it 's done at last .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 8]: He wanted more persuading than I expected .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 15]: It 's three weeks ago , since we first put this in his head .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 10]: What 'll he bring , do you think ? '
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 16]: ` Whatever he brings , it 's halved between us , ' returned Isaac List .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 5]: The other man nodded .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 26]: ` We must make quick work of it , ' he said , ` and then cut his acquaintance , or we may be suspected .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 6]: Sharp 's the word . '
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 6]: List and the gipsy acquiesced .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 41]: When they had all three amused themselves a little with their victim 's infatuation , they dismissed the subject as one which had been sufficiently discussed , and began to talk in a jargon which the child did not understand .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 71]: As their discourse appeared to relate to matters in which they were warmly interested , however , she deemed it the best time for escaping unobserved ; and crept away with slow and cautious steps , keeping in the shadow of the hedges , or forcing a path through them or the dry ditches , until she could emerge upon the road at a point beyond their range of vision .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 36]: Then she fled homeward as quickly as she could , torn and bleeding from the wounds of thorns and briars , but more lacerated in mind , and threw herself upon her bed , distracted .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 39]: The first idea that flashed upon her mind was flight , instant flight ; dragging him from that place , and rather dying of want upon the roadside , than ever exposing him again to such terrible temptations .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 31]: Then , she remembered that the crime was not to be committed until next night , and there was the intermediate time for thinking , and resolving what to do .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 66]: Then , she was distracted with a horrible fear that he might be committing it at that moment ; with a dread of hearing shrieks and cries piercing the silence of the night ; with fearful thoughts of what he might be tempted and led on to do , if he were detected in the act , and had but a woman to struggle with .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 8]: It was impossible to bear such torture .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 18]: She stole to the room where the money was , opened the door , and looked in .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 4]: God be praised !
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 11]: He was not there , and she was sleeping soundly .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 16]: She went back to her own room , and tried to prepare herself for bed .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 7]: But who could sleep -- sleep !
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 11]: who could lie passively down , distracted by such terrors ?
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 10]: They came upon her more and more strongly yet .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 33]: Half undressed , and with her hair in wild disorder , she flew to the old man 's bedside , clasped him by the wrist , and roused him from his sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 6]: ` What 's this ! '
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 18]: he cried , starting up in bed , and fixing his eyes upon her spectral face . '
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 25]: I have had a dreadful dream , ' said the child , with an energy that nothing but such terrors could have inspired . '
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 6]: A dreadful , horrible dream .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 7]: I have had it once before .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 22]: It is a dream of grey-haired men like you , in darkened rooms by night , robbing sleepers of their gold .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 5]: Up , up ! '
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 17]: The old man shook in every joint , and folded his hands like one who prays .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 25]: ` Not to me , ' said the child , ` not to me -- to Heaven , to save us from such deeds !
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 6]: This dream is too real .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 25]: I can not sleep , I can not stay here , I can not leave you alone under the roof where such dreams come .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 2]: Up !
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 5]: We must fly . '
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 30]: He looked at her as if she were a spirit -- she might have been for all the look of earth she had -- and trembled more and more .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 20]: ` There is no time to lose ; I will not lose one minute , ' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 3]: ` Up !
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 6]: and away with me ! '
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 4]: ` To-night ? '
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 5]: murmured the old man .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 10]: ` Yes , to-night , ' replied the child .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 8]: ` To-morrow night will be too late .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 7]: The dream will have come again .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 7]: Nothing but flight can save us .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 3]: Up ! '
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 46]: The old man rose from his bed : his forehead bedewed with the cold sweat of fear : and , bending before the child as if she had been an angel messenger sent to lead him where she would , made ready to follow her .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 11]: She took him by the hand and led him on .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 23]: As they passed the door of the room he had proposed to rob , she shuddered and looked up into his face .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 17]: What a white face was that , and with what a look did he meet hers !
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 43]: She took him to her own chamber , and , still holding him by the hand as if she feared to lose him for an instant , gathered together the little stock she had , and hung her basket on her arm .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 33]: The old man took his wallet from her hands and strapped it on his shoulders -- his staff , too , she had brought away -- and then she led him forth .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 16]: Through the strait streets , and narrow crooked outskirts , their trembling feet passed quickly .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 26]: Up the steep hill too , crowned by the old grey castle , they toiled with rapid steps , and had not once looked behind .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 98]: But as they drew nearer the ruined walls , the moon rose in all her gentle glory , and , from their venerable age , garlanded with ivy , moss , and waving grass , the child looked back upon the sleeping town , deep in the valley 's shade : and on the far-off river with its winding track of light : and on the distant hills ; and as she did so , she clasped the hand she held , less firmly , and bursting into tears , fell upon the old man 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 74]: Chapter 43 Her momentary weakness past , the child again summoned the resolution which had until now sustained her , and , endeavouring to keep steadily in her view the one idea that they were flying from disgrace and crime , and that her grandfather 's preservation must depend solely on her firmness , unaided by one word of advice or any helping hand , urged him onward and looked back no more .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 60]: While he , subdued and abashed , seemed to crouch before her , and to shrink and cower down , as if in the presence of some superior creature , the child herself was sensible of a new feeling within her , which elevated her nature , and inspired her with an energy and confidence she had never known .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 30]: There was no divided responsibility now ; the whole burden of their two lives had fallen upon her , and henceforth she must think and act for both . '
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 9]: I have saved him , ' she thought .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 13]: ` In all dangers and distresses , I will remember that . '
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 60]: At any other time , the recollection of having deserted the friend who had shown them so much homely kindness , without a word of justification -- the thought that they were guilty , in appearance , of treachery and ingratitude -- even the having parted from the two sisters -- would have filled her with sorrow and regret .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 33]: But now , all other considerations were lost in the new uncertainties and anxieties of their wild and wandering life ; and the very desperation of their condition roused and stimulated her .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 119]: In the pale moonlight , which lent a wanness of its own to the delicate face where thoughtful care already mingled with the winning grace and loveliness of youth , the too bright eye , the spiritual head , the lips that pressed each other with such high resolve and courage of the heart , the slight figure firm in its bearing and yet so very weak , told their silent tale ; but told it only to the wind that rustled by , which , taking up its burden , carried , perhaps to some mother 's pillow , faint dreams of childhood fading in its bloom , and resting in the sleep that knows no waking .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 28]: The night crept on apace , the moon went down , the stars grew pale and dim , and morning , cold as they , slowly approached .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 36]: Then , from behind a distant hill , the noble sun rose up , driving the mists in phantom shapes before it , and clearing the earth of their ghostly forms till darkness came again .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 34]: When it had climbed higher into the sky , and there was warmth in its cheerful beams , they laid them down to sleep , upon a bank , hard by some water .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 26]: But Nell retained her grasp upon the old man 's arm , and long after he was slumbering soundly , watched him with untiring eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 23]: Fatigue stole over her at last ; her grasp relaxed , tightened , relaxed again , and they slept side by side .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 14]: A confused sound of voices , mingling with her dreams , awoke her .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 39]: A man of very uncouth and rough appearance was standing over them , and two of his companions were looking on , from a long heavy boat which had come close to the bank while they were sleeping .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 40]: The boat had neither oar nor sail , but was towed by a couple of horses , who , with the rope to which they were harnessed slack and dripping in the water , were resting on the path .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 4]: ` Holloa ! '
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 5]: said the man roughly .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 8]: ` What 's the matter here ? '
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 12]: ` We were only asleep , Sir , ' said Nell .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 10]: ` We have been walking all night . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 21]: A pair of queer travellers to be walking all night , ' observed the man who had first accosted them .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 23]: ` One of you is a trifle too old for that sort of work , and the other a trifle too young .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 6]: Where are you going ? '
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 26]: Nell faltered , and pointed at hazard towards the West , upon which the man inquired if she meant a certain town which he named .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 17]: Nell , to avoid more questioning , said ` Yes , that was the place . '
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 8]: ` Where have you come from ? '
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 46]: was the next question ; and this being an easier one to answer , Nell mentioned the name of the village in which their friend the schoolmaster dwelt , as being less likely to be known to the men or to provoke further inquiry . '
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 18]: I thought somebody had been robbing and ill-using you , might be , ' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 5]: ` That 's all .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 4]: Good day . '
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 29]: Returning his salute and feeling greatly relieved by his departure , Nell looked after him as he mounted one of the horses , and the boat went on .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 21]: It had not gone very far , when it stopped again , and she saw the men beckoning to her .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 8]: ` Did you call to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 8]: said Nell , running up to them .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 19]: ` You may go with us if you like , ' replied one of those in the boat .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 10]: ` We 're going to the same place . '
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 7]: The child hesitated for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 77]: Thinking , as she had thought with great trepidation more than once before , that the men whom she had seen with her grandfather might , perhaps , in their eagerness for the booty , follow them , and regaining their influence over him , set hers at nought ; and that if they went with these men , all traces of them must surely be lost at that spot ; determined to accept the offer .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 35]: The boat came close to the bank again , and before she had had any more time for consideration , she and her grandfather were on board , and gliding smoothly down the canal .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 44]: The sun shone pleasantly on the bright water , which was sometimes shaded by trees , and sometimes open to a wide extent of country , intersected by running streams , and rich with wooded hills , cultivated land , and sheltered farms .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 81]: Now and then , a village with its modest spire , thatched roofs , and gable-ends , would peep out from among the trees ; and , more than once , a distant town , with great church towers looming through its smoke , and high factories or workshops rising above the mass of houses , would come in view , and , by the length of time it lingered in the distance , show them how slowly they travelled .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 58]: Their way lay , for the most part , through the low grounds , and open plains ; and except these distant places , and occasionally some men working in the fields , or lounging on the bridges under which they passed , to see them creep along , nothing encroached on their monotonous and secluded track .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 56]: Nell was rather disheartened , when they stopped at a kind of wharf late in the afternoon , to learn from one of the men that they would not reach their place of destination until next day , and that , if she had no provision with her , she had better buy it there .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 45]: She had but a few pence , having already bargained with them for some bread , but even of these it was necessary to be very careful , as they were on their way to an utterly strange place , with no resource whatever .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 52]: A small loaf and a morsel of cheese , therefore , were all she could afford , and with these she took her place in the boat again , and , after half an hour 's delay during which the men were drinking at the public-house , proceeded on the journey .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 35]: They brought some beer and spirits into the boat with them , and what with drinking freely before , and again now , were soon in a fair way of being quarrelsome and intoxicated .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 67]: Avoiding the small cabin , therefore , which was very dark and filthy , and to which they often invited both her and her grandfather , Nell sat in the open air with the old man by her side : listening to their boisterous hosts with a palpitating heart , and almost wishing herself safe on shore again though she should have to walk all night .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 26]: They were , in truth , very rugged , noisy fellows , and quite brutal among themselves , though civil enough to their two passengers .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 105]: Thus , when a quarrel arose between the man who was steering and his friend in the cabin , upon the question who had first suggested the propriety of offering Nell some beer , and when the quarrel led to a scuffle in which they beat each other fearfully , to her inexpressible terror , neither visited his displeasure upon her , but each contented himself with venting it on his adversary , on whom , in addition to blows , he bestowed a variety of compliments , which , happily for the child , were conveyed in terms , to her quite unintelligible .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 86]: The difference was finally adjusted , by the man who had come out of the cabin knocking the other into it head first , and taking the helm into his own hands , without evincing the least discomposure himself , or causing any in his friend , who , being of a tolerably strong constitution and perfectly inured to such trifles , went to sleep as he was , with his heels upwards , and in a couple of minutes or so was snoring comfortably .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 47]: By this time it was night again , and though the child felt cold , being but poorly clad , her anxious thoughts were far removed from her own suffering or uneasiness , and busily engaged in endeavouring to devise some scheme for their joint subsistence .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 18]: The same spirit which had supported her on the previous night , upheld and sustained her now .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 23]: Her grandfather lay sleeping safely at her side , and the crime to which his madness urged him , was not committed .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 5]: That was her comfort .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 21]: How every circumstance of her short , eventful life , came thronging into her mind , as they travelled on !
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 157]: Slight incidents , never thought of or remembered until now ; faces , seen once and ever since forgotten ; words scarcely heeded at the time ; scenes , of a year ago and those of yesterday , mixing up and linking themselves together ; familiar places shaping themselves out in the darkness from things which , when approached , were , of all others , the most remote and most unlike them ; sometimes , a strange confusion in her mind relative to the occasion of her being there , and the place to which she was going , and the people she was with ; and imagination suggesting remarks and questions which sounded so plainly in her ears , that she would start , and turn , and be almost tempted to reply ; -- all the fancies and contradictions common in watching and excitement and restless change of place , beset the child .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 63]: She happened , while she was thus engaged , to encounter the face of the man on deck , in whom the sentimental stage of drunkenness had now succeeded to the boisterous , and who , taking from his mouth a short pipe , quilted over with string for its longer preservation , requested that she would oblige him with a song .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 46]: ` You 've got a very pretty voice , a very soft eye , and a very strong memory , ' said this gentleman ; ` the voice and eye I 've got evidence for , and the memory 's an opinion of my own .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 6]: And I 'm never wrong .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 10]: Let me hear a song this minute . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 14]: I do n't think I know one , sir , ' returned Nell .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 23]: ` You know forty-seven songs , ' said the man , with a gravity which admitted of no altercation on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 6]: ` Forty-seven 's your number .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 10]: Let me hear one of 'em -- the best .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 8]: Give me a song this minute . '
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 101]: Not knowing what might be the consequences of irritating her friend , and trembling with the fear of doing so , poor Nell sang him some little ditty which she had learned in happier times , and which was so agreeable to his ear , that on its conclusion he in the same peremptory manner requested to be favoured with another , to which he was so obliging as to roar a chorus to no particular tune , and with no words at all , but which amply made up in its amazing energy for its deficiency in other respects .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 45]: The noise of this vocal performance awakened the other man , who , staggering upon deck and shaking his late opponent by the hand , swore that singing was his pride and joy and chief delight , and that he desired no better entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 73]: With a third call , more imperative than either of the two former , Nell felt obliged to comply , and this time a chorus was maintained not only by the two men together , but also by the third man on horseback , who being by his position debarred from a nearer participation in the revels of the night , roared when his companions roared , and rent the very air .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 67]: In this way , with little cessation , and singing the same songs again and again , the tired and exhausted child kept them in good humour all that night ; and many a cottager , who was roused from his soundest sleep by the discordant chorus as it floated away upon the wind , hid his head beneath the bed-clothes and trembled at the sounds .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 6]: At length the morning dawned .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 12]: It was no sooner light than it began to rain heavily .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 47]: As the child could not endure the intolerable vapours of the cabin , they covered her , in return for her exertions , with some pieces of sail-cloth and ends of tarpaulin , which sufficed to keep her tolerably dry and to shelter her grandfather besides .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 8]: As the day advanced the rain increased .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 18]: At noon it poured down more hopelessly and heavily than ever without the faintest promise of abatement .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 18]: They had , for some time , been gradually approaching the place for which they were bound .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 59]: The water had become thicker and dirtier ; other barges , coming from it , passed them frequently ; the paths of coal-ash and huts of staring brick , marked the vicinity of some great manufacturing town ; while scattered streets and houses , and smoke from distant furnaces , indicated that they were already in the outskirts .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 94]: Now , the clustered roofs , and piles of buildings , trembling with the working of engines , and dimly resounding with their shrieks and throbbings ; the tall chimneys vomiting forth a black vapour , which hung in a dense ill-favoured cloud above the housetops and filled the air with gloom ; the clank of hammers beating upon iron , the roar of busy streets and noisy crowds , gradually augmenting until all the various sounds blended into one and none was distinguishable for itself , announced the termination of their journey .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 11]: The boat floated into the wharf to which it belonged .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 6]: The men were occupied directly .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 77]: The child and her grandfather , after waiting in vain to thank them or ask them whither they should go , passed through a dirty lane into a crowded street , and stood , amid its din and tumult , and in the pouring rain , as strange , bewildered , and confused , as if they had lived a thousand years before , and were raised from the dead and placed there by a miracle .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 182]: Chapter 44 The throng of people hurried by , in two opposite streams , with no symptom of cessation or exhaustion ; intent upon their own affairs ; and undisturbed in their business speculations , by the roar of carts and waggons laden with clashing wares , the slipping of horses ' feet upon the wet and greasy pavement , the rattling of the rain on windows and umbrella-tops , the jostling of the more impatient passengers , and all the noise and tumult of a crowded street in the high tide of its occupation : while the two poor strangers , stunned and bewildered by the hurry they beheld but had no part in , looked mournfully on ; feeling , amidst the crowd , a solitude which has no parallel but in the thirst of the shipwrecked mariner , who , tost to and fro upon the billows of a mighty ocean , his red eyes blinded by looking on the water which hems him in on every side , has not one drop to cool his burning tongue .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 34]: They withdrew into a low archway for shelter from the rain , and watched the faces of those who passed , to find in one among them a ray of encouragement or hope .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 63]: Some frowned , some smiled , some muttered to themselves , some made slight gestures , as if anticipating the conversation in which they would shortly be engaged , some wore the cunning look of bargaining and plotting , some were anxious and eager , some slow and dull ; in some countenances , were written gain ; in others , loss .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 25]: It was like being in the confidence of all these people to stand quietly there , looking into their faces as they flitted past .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 35]: In busy places , where each man has an object of his own , and feels assured that every other man has his , his character and purpose are written broadly in his face .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 35]: In the public walks and lounges of a town , people go to see and to be seen , and there the same expression , with little variety , is repeated a hundred times .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 16]: The working-day faces come nearer to the truth , and let it out more plainly .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 37]: Falling into that kind of abstraction which such a solitude awakens , the child continued to gaze upon the passing crowd with a wondering interest , amounting almost to a temporary forgetfulness of her own condition .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 37]: But cold , wet , hunger , want of rest , and lack of any place in which to lay her aching head , soon brought her thoughts back to the point whence they had strayed .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 16]: No one passed who seemed to notice them , or to whom she durst appeal .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 20]: After some time , they left their place of refuge from the weather , and mingled with the concourse .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 4]: Evening came on .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 34]: They were still wandering up and down , with fewer people about them , but with the same sense of solitude in their own breasts , and the same indifference from all around .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 28]: The lights in the streets and shops made them feel yet more desolate , for with their help , night and darkness seemed to come on faster .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 31]: Shivering with the cold and damp , ill in body , and sick to death at heart , the child needed her utmost firmness and resolution even to creep along .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 39]: Why had they ever come to this noisy town , when there were peaceful country places , in which , at least , they might have hungered and thirsted , with less suffering than in its squalid strife !
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 26]: They were but an atom , here , in a mountain heap of misery , the very sight of which increased their hopelessness and suffering .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 47]: The child had not only to endure the accumulated hardships of their destitute condition , but to bear the reproaches of her grandfather , who began to murmur at having been led away from their late abode , and demand that they should return to it .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 51]: Being now penniless , and no relief or prospect of relief appearing , they retraced their steps through the deserted streets , and went back to the wharf , hoping to find the boat in which they had come , and to be allowed to sleep on board that night .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 28]: But here again they were disappointed , for the gate was closed , and some fierce dogs , barking at their approach , obliged them to retreat .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 58]: ` We must sleep in the open air to-night , dear , ' said the child in a weak voice , as they turned away from this last repulse ; ` and to-morrow we will beg our way to some quiet part of the country , and try to earn our bread in very humble work . '
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 9]: ` Why did you bring me here ? '
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 7]: returned the old man fiercely . '
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 9]: I can not bear these close eternal streets .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 7]: We came from a quiet part .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 10]: Why did you force me to leave it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 45]: ` Because I must have that dream I told you of , no more , ' said the child , with a momentary firmness that lost itself in tears ; ` and we must live among poor people , or it will come again .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 17]: Dear grandfather , you are old and weak , I know ; but look at me .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 17]: I never will complain if you will not , but I have some suffering indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 10]: poor , houseless , wandering , motherless child ! '
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 45]: cried the old man , clasping his hands and gazing as if for the first time upon her anxious face , her travel-stained dress , and bruised and swollen feet ; ` has all my agony of care brought her to this at last !
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 21]: Was I a happy man once , and have I lost happiness and all I had , for this ! '
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 68]: ` If we were in the country now , ' said the child , with assumed cheerfulness , as they walked on looking about them for a shelter , we should find some good old tree , stretching out his green arms as if he loved us , and nodding and rustling as if he would have us fall asleep , thinking of him while he watched .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 67]: Please God , we shall be there soon -- to-morrow or next day at the farthest -- and in the meantime let us think , dear , that it was a good thing we came here ; for we are lost in the crowd and hurry of this place , and if any cruel people should pursue us , they could surely never trace us further .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 6]: There 's comfort in that .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 33]: And here 's a deep old doorway -- very dark , but quite dry , and warm too , for the wind do n't blow in here -- What 's that ! '
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 36]: Uttering a half shriek , she recoiled from a black figure which came suddenly out of the dark recess in which they were about to take refuge , and stood still , looking at them .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 16]: ` Speak again , ' it said ; ` do I know the voice ? '
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 31]: ` No , ' replied the child timidly ; ` we are strangers , and having no money for a night 's lodging , were going to rest here . '
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 36]: There was a feeble lamp at no great distance ; the only one in the place , which was a kind of square yard , but sufficient to show how poor and mean it was .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 36]: To this , the figure beckoned them ; at the same time drawing within its rays , as if to show that it had no desire to conceal itself or take them at an advantage .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 38]: The form was that of a man , miserably clad and begrimed with smoke , which , perhaps by its contrast with the natural colour of his skin , made him look paler than he really was .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 38]: That he was naturally of a very wan and pallid aspect , however , his hollow cheeks , sharp features , and sunken eyes , no less than a certain look of patient endurance , sufficiently testified .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 41]: His voice was harsh by nature , but not brutal ; and though his face , besides possessing the characteristics already mentioned , was overshadowed by a quantity of long dark hair , its expression was neither ferocious nor bad .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 11]: ` How came you to think of resting there ? '
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 32]: ` Or how , ' he added , looking more attentively at the child , ` do you come to want a place of rest at this time of night ? '
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 15]: ` Our misfortunes , ' the grandfather answered , ` are the cause . '
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 37]: ` Do you know , ' said the man , looking still more earnestly at Nell , ` how wet she is , and that the damp streets are not a place for her ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 13]: I know it well , God help me , ' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 7]: ` What can I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 25]: The man looked at Nell again , and gently touched her garments , from which the rain was running off in little streams . '
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 18]: I can give you warmth , ' he said , after a pause ; ` nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 33]: Such lodging as I have , is in that house , ' pointing to the doorway from which he had emerged , ` but she is safer and better there than here .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 26]: The fire is in a rough place , but you can pass the night beside it safely , if you 'll trust yourselves to me .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 8]: You see that red light yonder ? '
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 24]: They raised their eyes , and saw a lurid glare hanging in the dark sky ; the dull reflection of some distant fire .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 11]: ` It 's not far , ' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 7]: ` Shall I take you there ?
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 23]: You were going to sleep upon cold bricks ; I can give you a bed of warm ashes -- nothing better . '
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 27]: Without waiting for any further reply than he saw in their looks , he took Nell in his arms , and bade the old man follow .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 77]: Carrying her as tenderly , and as easily too , as if she had been an infant , and showing himself both swift and sure of foot , he led the way through what appeared to be the poorest and most wretched quarter of the town ; and turning aside to avoid the overflowing kennels or running waterspouts , but holding his course , regardless of such obstructions , and making his way straight through them .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 61]: They had proceeded thus , in silence , for some quarter of an hour , and had lost sight of the glare to which he had pointed , in the dark and narrow ways by which they had come , when it suddenly burst upon them again , streaming up from the high chimney of a building close before them .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 23]: ` This is the place , ' he said , pausing at a door to put Nell down and take her hand .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 6]: ` Do n't be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 9]: There 's nobody here will harm you . '
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 27]: It needed a strong confidence in this assurance to induce them to enter , and what they saw inside did not diminish their apprehension and alarm .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 119]: In a large and lofty building , supported by pillars of iron , with great black apertures in the upper walls , open to the external air ; echoing to the roof with the beating of hammers and roar of furnaces , mingled with the hissing of red-hot metal plunged in water , and a hundred strange unearthly noises never heard elsewhere ; in this gloomy place , moving like demons among the flame and smoke , dimly and fitfully seen , flushed and tormented by the burning fires , and wielding great weapons , a faulty blow from any one of which must have crushed some workman 's skull , a number of men laboured like giants .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 27]: Others , reposing upon heaps of coals or ashes , with their faces turned to the black vault above , slept or rested from their toil .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 31]: Others again , opening the white-hot furnace-doors , cast fuel on the flames , which came rushing and roaring forth to meet it , and licked it up like oil .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 39]: Others drew forth , with clashing noise , upon the ground , great sheets of glowing steel , emitting an insupportable heat , and a dull deep light like that which reddens in the eyes of savage beasts .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 59]: Through these bewildering sights and deafening sounds , their conductor led them to where , in a dark portion of the building , one furnace burnt by night and day -- so , at least , they gathered from the motion of his lips , for as yet they could only see him speak : not hear him .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 66]: The man who had been watching this fire , and whose task was ended for the present , gladly withdrew , and left them with their friend , who , spreading Nell 's little cloak upon a heap of ashes , and showing her where she could hang her outer-clothes to dry , signed to her and the old man to lie down and sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 48]: For himself , he took his station on a rugged mat before the furnace-door , and resting his chin upon his hands , watched the flame as it shone through the iron chinks , and the white ashes as they fell into their bright hot grave below .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 52]: The warmth of her bed , hard and humble as it was , combined with the great fatigue she had undergone , soon caused the tumult of the place to fall with a gentler sound upon the child 's tired ears , and was not long in lulling her to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 20]: The old man was stretched beside her , and with her hand upon his neck she lay and dreamed .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 26]: It was yet night when she awoke , nor did she know how long , or for how short a time , she had slept .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 74]: But she found herself protected , both from any cold air that might find its way into the building , and from the scorching heat , by some of the workmen 's clothes ; and glancing at their friend saw that he sat in exactly the same attitude , looking with a fixed earnestness of attention towards the fire , and keeping so very still that he did not even seem to breathe .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 47]: She lay in the state between sleeping and waking , looking so long at his motionless figure that at length she almost feared he had died as he sat there ; and softly rising and drawing close to him , ventured to whisper in his ear .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 37]: He moved , and glancing from her to the place she had lately occupied , as if to assure himself that it was really the child so near him , looked inquiringly into her face . '
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 10]: I feared you were ill , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 17]: ` The other men are all in motion , and you are so very quiet . '
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 11]: ` They leave me to myself , ' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 6]: ` They know my humour .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 13]: They laugh at me , but do n't harm me in it .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 10]: See yonder there -- that 's my friend . '
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 5]: ` The fire ? '
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 4]: said the child .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 17]: ` It has been alive as long as I have , ' the man made answer .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 11]: ` We talk and think together all night long . '
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 27]: The child glanced quickly at him in her surprise , but he had turned his eyes in their former direction , and was musing as before .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 32]: ` It 's like a book to me , ' he said -- ` the only book I ever learned to read ; and many an old story it tells me .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 23]: It 's music , for I should know its voice among a thousand , and there are other voices in its roar .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 6]: It has its pictures too .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 18]: You do n't know how many strange faces and different scenes I trace in the red-hot coals .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 16]: It 's my memory , that fire , and shows me all my life . '
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 26]: The child , bending down to listen to his words , could not help remarking with what brightened eyes he continued to speak and muse .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 34]: ` Yes , ' he said , with a faint smile , ` it was the same when I was quite a baby , and crawled about it , till I fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 7]: My father watched it then . '
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 7]: ` Had you no mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 4]: asked the child .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 7]: ` No , she was dead .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 7]: Women work hard in these parts .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 29]: She worked herself to death they told me , and , as they said so then , the fire has gone on saying the same thing ever since .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 6]: I suppose it was true .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 7]: I have always believed it . '
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 10]: ` Were you brought up here , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 4]: said the child .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 9]: ` Summer and winter , ' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 19]: ` Secretly at first , but when they found it out , they let him keep me here .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 10]: So the fire nursed me -- the same fire .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 7]: It has never gone out . '
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 8]: ` You are fond of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 4]: said the child .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 6]: ` Of course I am .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 5]: He died before it .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 30]: I saw him fall down -- just there , where those ashes are burning now -- and wondered , I remember , why it did n't help him . '
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 9]: ` Have you been here ever since ? '
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 4]: asked the child .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 25]: ` Ever since I came to watch it ; but there was a while between , and a very cold dreary while it was .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 26]: It burned all the time though , and roared and leaped when I came back , as it used to do in our play days .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 64]: You may guess , from looking at me , what kind of child I was , but for all the difference between us I was a child , and when I saw you in the street to-night , you put me in mind of myself , as I was after he died , and made me wish to bring you to the fire .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 16]: I thought of those old times again , when I saw you sleeping by it .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 6]: You should be sleeping now .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 12]: Lie down again , poor child , lie down again ! '
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 51]: With that , he led her to her rude couch , and covering her with the clothes with which she had found herself enveloped when she woke , returned to his seat , whence he moved no more unless to feed the furnace , but remained motionless as a statue .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 58]: The child continued to watch him for a little time , but soon yielded to the drowsiness that came upon her , and , in the dark strange place and on the heap of ashes , slept as peacefully as if the room had been a palace chamber , and the bed , a bed of down .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 40]: When she awoke again , broad day was shining through the lofty openings in the walls , and , stealing in slanting rays but midway down , seemed to make the building darker than it had been at night .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 32]: The clang and tumult were still going on , and the remorseless fires were burning fiercely as before ; for few changes of night and day brought rest or quiet there .
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 30]: Her friend parted his breakfast -- a scanty mess of coffee and some coarse bread -- with the child and her grandfather , and inquired whither they were going .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 34]: She told him that they sought some distant country place remote from towns or even other villages , and with a faltering tongue inquired what road they would do best to take . '
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 37]: I know little of the country , ' he said , shaking his head , ` for such as I , pass all our lives before our furnace doors , and seldom go forth to breathe .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 8]: But there are such places yonder . '
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 7]: ` And far from here ? '
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 3]: said Nell .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 4]: ` Aye surely .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 13]: How could they be near us , and be green and fresh ?
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 34]: The road lies , too , through miles and miles , all lighted up by fires like ours -- a strange black road , and one that would frighten you by night . '
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 30]: ` We are here and must go on , ' said the child boldly ; for she saw that the old man listened with anxious ears to this account .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 28]: ` Rough people -- paths never made for little feet like yours -- a dismal blighted way -- is there no turning back , my child ! '
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 12]: ` There is none , ' cried Nell , pressing forward .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 9]: ` If you can direct us , do .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 14]: If not , pray do not seek to turn us from our purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 40]: Indeed you do not know the danger that we shun , and how right and true we are in flying from it , or you would not try to stop us , I am sure you would not . '
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 10]: ` God forbid , if it is so ! '
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 26]: said their uncouth protector , glancing from the eager child to her grandfather , who hung his head and bent his eyes upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 14]: ` I 'll direct you from the door , the best I can .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 8]: I wish I could do more . '
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 27]: He showed them , then , by which road they must leave the town , and what course they should hold when they had gained it .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 28]: He lingered so long on these instructions , that the child , with a fervent blessing , tore herself away , and stayed to hear no more .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 39]: But , before they had reached the corner of the lane , the man came running after them , and , pressing her hand , left something in it -- two old , battered , smoke-encrusted penny pieces .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 23]: Who knows but they shone as brightly in the eyes of angels , as golden gifts that have been chronicled on tombs ?
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 43]: And thus they separated ; the child to lead her sacred charge farther from guilt and shame ; the labourer to attach a fresh interest to the spot where his guests had slept , and read new histories in his furnace fire .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 35]: Chapter 45 In all their journeying , they had never longed so ardently , they had never so pined and wearied , for the freedom of pure air and open country , as now .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 106]: No , not even on that memorable morning , when , deserting their old home , they abandoned themselves to the mercies of a strange world , and left all the dumb and senseless things they had known and loved , behind -- not even then , had they so yearned for the fresh solitudes of wood , hillside , and field , as now , when the noise and dirt and vapour , of the great manufacturing town reeking with lean misery and hungry wretchedness , hemmed them in on every side , and seemed to shut out hope , and render escape impossible .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 7]: ` Two days and nights ! '
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 4]: thought the child .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 18]: ` He said two days and nights we should have to spend among such scenes as these .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 44]: if we live to reach the country once again , if we get clear of these dreadful places , though it is only to lie down and die , with what a grateful heart I shall thank God for so much mercy ! '
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 105]: With thoughts like this , and with some vague design of travelling to a great distance among streams and mountains , where only very poor and simple people lived , and where they might maintain themselves by very humble helping work in farms , free from such terrors as that from which they fled -- the child , with no resource but the poor man 's gift , and no encouragement but that which flowed from her own heart , and its sense of the truth and right of what she did , nerved herself to this last journey and boldly pursued her task .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 42]: ` We shall be very slow to-day , dear , ' she said , as they toiled painfully through the streets ; ` my feet are sore , and I have pains in all my limbs from the wet of yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 25]: I saw that he looked at us and thought of that , when he said how long we should be upon the road . '
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 18]: ` It was a dreary way he told us of , ' returned her grandfather , piteously .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 7]: ` Is there no other road ?
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 13]: Will you not let me go some other way than this ? '
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 29]: ` Places lie beyond these , ' said the child , firmly , ` where we may live in peace , and be tempted to do no harm .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 36]: We will take the road that promises to have that end , and we would not turn out of it , if it were a hundred times worse than our fears lead us to expect .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 10]: We would not , dear , would we ? '
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 21]: ` No , ' replied the old man , wavering in his voice , no less than in his manner .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 5]: Let us go on .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 4]: I am ready .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 8]: I am quite ready , Nell . '
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 34]: The child walked with more difficulty than she had led her companion to expect , for the pains that racked her joints were of no common severity , and every exertion increased them .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 27]: But they wrung from her no complaint , or look of suffering ; and , though the two travellers proceeded very slowly , they did proceed .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 20]: Clearing the town in course of time , they began to feel that they were fairly on their way .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 133]: A long suburb of red brick houses -- some with patches of garden-ground , where coal-dust and factory smoke darkened the shrinking leaves , and coarse rank flowers , and where the struggling vegetation sickened and sank under the hot breath of kiln and furnace , making them by its presence seem yet more blighting and unwholesome than in the town itself -- a long , flat , straggling suburb passed , they came , by slow degrees , upon a cheerless region , where not a blade of grass was seen to grow , where not a bud put forth its promise in the spring , where nothing green could live but on the surface of the stagnant pools , which here and there lay idly sweltering by the black road-side .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 29]: Advancing more and more into the shadow of this mournful place , its dark depressing influence stole upon their spirits , and filled them with a dismal gloom .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 63]: On every side , and far as the eye could see into the heavy distance , tall chimneys , crowding on each other , and presenting that endless repetition of the same dull , ugly form , which is the horror of oppressive dreams , poured out their plague of smoke , obscured the light , and made foul the melancholy air .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 59]: On mounds of ashes by the wayside , sheltered only by a few rough boards , or rotten pent-house roofs , strange engines spun and writhed like tortured creatures ; clanking their iron chains , shrieking in their rapid whirl from time to time as though in torment unendurable , and making the ground tremble with their agonies .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 35]: Dismantled houses here and there appeared , tottering to the earth , propped up by fragments of others that had fallen down , unroofed , windowless , blackened , desolate , but yet inhabited .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 37]: Men , women , children , wan in their looks and ragged in attire , tended the engines , fed their tributary fire , begged upon the road , or scowled half-naked from the doorless houses .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 88]: Then came more of the wrathful monsters , whose like they almost seemed to be in their wildness and their untamed air , screeching and turning round and round again ; and still , before , behind , and to the right and left , was the same interminable perspective of brick towers , never ceasing in their black vomit , blasting all things living or inanimate , shutting out the face of day , and closing in on all these horrors with a dense dark cloud .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 7]: But night-time in this dreadful spot !
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 282]: -- night , when the smoke was changed to fire ; when every chimney spirited up its flame ; and places , that had been dark vaults all day , now shone red-hot , with figures moving to and fro within their blazing jaws , and calling to one another with hoarse cries -- night , when the noise of every strange machine was aggravated by the darkness ; when the people near them looked wilder and more savage ; when bands of unemployed labourers paraded the roads , or clustered by torch-light round their leaders , who told them , in stern language , of their wrongs , and urged them on to frightful cries and threats ; when maddened men , armed with sword and firebrand , spurning the tears and prayers of women who would restrain them , rushed forth on errands of terror and destruction , to work no ruin half so surely as their own -- night , when carts came rumbling by , filled with rude coffins -LRB- for contagious disease and death had been busy with the living crops -RRB- ; when orphans cried , and distracted women shrieked and followed in their wake -- night , when some called for bread , and some for drink to drown their cares , and some with tears , and some with staggering feet , and some with bloodshot eyes , went brooding home -- night , which , unlike the night that Heaven sends on earth , brought with it no peace , nor quiet , nor signs of blessed sleep -- who shall tell the terrors of the night to the young wandering child !
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 39]: And yet she lay down , with nothing between her and the sky ; and , with no fear for herself , for she was past it now , put up a prayer for the poor old man .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 39]: So very weak and spent , she felt , so very calm and unresisting , that she had no thought of any wants of her own , but prayed that God would raise up some friend for him .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 29]: She tried to recall the way they had come , and to look in the direction where the fire by which they had slept last night was burning .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 41]: She had forgotten to ask the name of the poor man , their friend , and when she had remembered him in her prayers , it seemed ungrateful not to turn one look towards the spot where he was watching .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 11]: A penny loaf was all they had had that day .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 20]: It was very little , but even hunger was forgotten in the strange tranquillity that crept over her senses .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 22]: She lay down , very gently , and , with a quiet smile upon her face , fell into a slumber .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 26]: It was not like sleep -- and yet it must have been , or why those pleasant dreams of the little scholar all night long !
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 3]: Morning came .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 42]: Much weaker , diminished powers even of sight and hearing , and yet the child made no complaint -- perhaps would have made none , even if she had not had that inducement to be silent , travelling by her side .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 33]: She felt a hopelessness of their ever being extricated together from that forlorn place ; a dull conviction that she was very ill , perhaps dying ; but no fear or anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 32]: A loathing of food that she was not conscious of until they expended their last penny in the purchase of another loaf , prevented her partaking even of this poor repast .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 12]: Her grandfather ate greedily , which she was glad to see .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 16]: Their way lay through the same scenes as yesterday , with no variety or improvement .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 27]: There was the same thick air , difficult to breathe ; the same blighted ground , the same hopeless prospect , the same misery and distress .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 38]: Objects appeared more dim , the noise less , the path more rugged and uneven , for sometimes she stumbled , and became roused , as it were , in the effort to prevent herself from falling .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 3]: Poor child !
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 8]: the cause was in her tottering feet .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 11]: Towards the afternoon , her grandfather complained bitterly of hunger .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 20]: She approached one of the wretched hovels by the way-side , and knocked with her hand upon the door .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 8]: ` What would you have here ? '
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 8]: said a gaunt man , opening it .
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 3]: ` Charity .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 6]: A morsel of bread . '
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 7]: ` Do you see that ? '
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 15]: returned the man hoarsely , pointing to a kind of bundle on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 7]: ` That 's a dead child .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 16]: I and five hundred other men were thrown out of work , three months ago .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 10]: That is my third dead child , and last .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 18]: Do you think I have charity to bestow , or a morsel of bread to spare ? '
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 13]: The child recoiled from the door , and it closed upon her .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 28]: Impelled by strong necessity , she knocked at another : a neighbouring one , which , yielding to the slight pressure of her hand , flew open .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 31]: It seemed that a couple of poor families lived in this hovel , for two women , each among children of her own , occupied different portions of the room .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 26]: In the centre , stood a grave gentleman in black who appeared to have just entered , and who held by the arm a boy .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 18]: ` Here , woman , ' he said , ` here 's your deaf and dumb son .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 10]: You may thank me for restoring him to you .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 28]: He was brought before me , this morning , charged with theft ; and with any other boy it would have gone hard , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 29]: But , as I had compassion on his infirmities , and thought he might have learnt no better , I have managed to bring him back to you .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 10]: Take more care of him for the future . '
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 12]: ` And wo n't you give me back MY son ! '
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 11]: said the other woman , hastily rising and confronting him .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 21]: ` Wo n't you give me back MY son , Sir , who was transported for the same offence ! '
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 10]: ` Was he deaf and dumb , woman ? '
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 5]: asked the gentleman sternly .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 8]: ` Was he not , Sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 8]: ` You know he was not . '
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 9]: ` He was , ' cried the woman .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 22]: ` He was deaf , dumb , and blind , to all that was good and right , from his cradle .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 8]: Her boy may have learnt no better !
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 6]: where did mine learn better ?
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 4]: where could he ?
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 17]: who was there to teach him better , or where was it to be learnt ? '
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 22]: ` Peace , woman , ' said the gentleman , ` your boy was in possession of all his senses . '
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 25]: ` He was , ' cried the mother ; ` and he was the more easy to be led astray because he had them .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 27]: If you save this boy because he may not know right from wrong , why did you not save mine who was never taught the difference ?
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 37]: You gentlemen have as good a right to punish her boy , that God has kept in ignorance of sound and speech , as you have to punish mine , that you kept in ignorance yourselves .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 68]: How many of the girls and boys -- ah , men and women too -- that are brought before you and you do n't pity , are deaf and dumb in their minds , and go wrong in that state , and are punished in that state , body and soul , while you gentlemen are quarrelling among yourselves whether they ought to learn this or that ?
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 16]: -- Be a just man , Sir , and give me back my son . '
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 25]: ` You are desperate , ' said the gentleman , taking out his snuff-box , ` and I am sorry for you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 17]: I AM desperate , ' returned the woman , ` and you have made me so .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 13]: Give me back my son , to work for these helpless children .
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 25]: Be a just man , Sir , and , as you have had mercy upon this boy , give me back my son ! '
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 22]: The child had seen and heard enough to know that this was not a place at which to ask for alms .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 16]: She led the old man softly from the door , and they pursued their journey .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 83]: With less and less of hope or strength , as they went on , but with an undiminished resolution not to betray by any word or sigh her sinking state , so long as she had energy to move , the child , throughout the remainder of that hard day , compelled herself to proceed : not even stopping to rest as frequently as usual , to compensate in some measure for the tardy pace at which she was obliged to walk .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 28]: Evening was drawing on , but had not closed in , when -- still travelling among the same dismal objects -- they came to a busy town .
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 12]: Faint and spiritless as they were , its streets were insupportable .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 49]: After humbly asking for relief at some few doors , and being repulsed , they agreed to make their way out of it as speedily as they could , and try if the inmates of any lone house beyond , would have more pity on their exhausted state .
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 30]: They were dragging themselves along through the last street , and the child felt that the time was close at hand when her enfeebled powers would bear no more .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 54]: There appeared before them , at this juncture , going in the same direction as themselves , a traveller on foot , who , with a portmanteau strapped to his back , leaned upon a stout stick as he walked , and read from a book which he held in his other hand .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 30]: It was not an easy matter to come up with him , and beseech his aid , for he walked fast , and was a little distance in advance .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 17]: At length , he stopped , to look more attentively at some passage in his book .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 45]: Animated with a ray of hope , the child shot on before her grandfather , and , going close to the stranger without rousing him by the sound of her footsteps , began , in a few faint words , to implore his help .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 5]: He turned his head .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 19]: The child clapped her hands together , uttered a wild shriek , and fell senseless at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 8]: Chapter 46 It was the poor schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 7]: No other than the poor schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 47]: Scarcely less moved and surprised by the sight of the child than she had been on recognising him , he stood , for a moment , silent and confounded by this unexpected apparition , without even the presence of mind to raise her from the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 70]: But , quickly recovering his self-possession , he threw down his stick and book , and dropping on one knee beside her , endeavoured , by such simple means as occurred to him , to restore her to herself ; while her grandfather , standing idly by , wrung his hands , and implored her with many endearing expressions to speak to him , were it only a word .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 17]: ` She is quite exhausted , ' said the schoolmaster , glancing upward into his face .
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 12]: ` You have taxed her powers too far , friend . '
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 14]: ` She is perishing of want , ' rejoined the old man . '
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 14]: I never thought how weak and ill she was , till now . '
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 43]: Casting a look upon him , half-reproachful and half-compassionate , the schoolmaster took the child in his arms , and , bidding the old man gather up her little basket and follow him directly , bore her away at his utmost speed .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 26]: There was a small inn within sight , to which , it would seem , he had been directing his steps when so unexpectedly overtaken .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 40]: Towards this place he hurried with his unconscious burden , and rushing into the kitchen , and calling upon the company there assembled to make way for God 's sake , deposited it on a chair before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 22]: The company , who rose in confusion on the schoolmaster 's entrance , did as people usually do under such circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 61]: Everybody called for his or her favourite remedy , which nobody brought ; each cried for more air , at the same time carefully excluding what air there was , by closing round the object of sympathy ; and all wondered why somebody else did n't do what it never appeared to occur to them might be done by themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 104]: The landlady , however , who possessed more readiness and activity than any of them , and who had withal a quicker perception of the merits of the case , soon came running in , with a little hot brandy and water , followed by her servant-girl , carrying vinegar , hartshorn , smelling-salts , and such other restoratives ; which , being duly administered , recovered the child so far as to enable her to thank them in a faint voice , and to extend her hand to the poor schoolmaster , who stood , with an anxious face , hard by .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 55]: Without suffering her to speak another word , or so much as to stir a finger any more , the women straightway carried her off to bed ; and , having covered her up warm , bathed her cold feet , and wrapped them in flannel , they despatched a messenger for the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 49]: The doctor , who was a red-nosed gentleman with a great bunch of seals dangling below a waistcoat of ribbed black satin , arrived with all speed , and taking his seat by the bedside of poor Nell , drew out his watch , and felt her pulse .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 32]: Then he looked at her tongue , then he felt her pulse again , and while he did so , he eyed the half-emptied wine-glass as if in profound abstraction . '
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 28]: I should give her , ' said the doctor at length , ' a tea-spoonful , every now and then , of hot brandy and water . '
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 14]: ` Why , that 's exactly what we 've done , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 6]: said the delighted landlady . '
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 50]: I should also , ' observed the doctor , who had passed the foot-bath on the stairs , ' I should also , ' said the doctor , in the voice of an oracle , ` put her feet in hot water , and wrap them up in flannel .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 49]: I should likewise , ' said the doctor with increased solemnity , ` give her something light for supper -- the wing of a roasted fowl now -- ' ` Why , goodness gracious me , sir , it 's cooking at the kitchen fire this instant ! '
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 4]: cried the landlady .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 40]: And so indeed it was , for the schoolmaster had ordered it to be put down , and it was getting on so well that the doctor might have smelt it if he had tried ; perhaps he did .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 38]: ` You may then , ' said the doctor , rising gravely , ` give her a glass of hot mulled port wine , if she likes wine -- ' ` And a toast , Sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 4]: suggested the landlady .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 20]: ` Ay , ' said the doctor , in the tone of a man who makes a dignified concession .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 8]: ` And a toast -- of bread .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 17]: But be very particular to make it of bread , if you please , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 31]: With which parting injunction , slowly and portentously delivered , the doctor departed , leaving the whole house in admiration of that wisdom which tallied so closely with their own .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 29]: Everybody said he was a very shrewd doctor indeed , and knew perfectly what people 's constitutions were ; which there appears some reason to suppose he did .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 27]: While her supper was preparing , the child fell into a refreshing sleep , from which they were obliged to rouse her when it was ready .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 35]: As she evinced extraordinary uneasiness on learning that her grandfather was below stairs , and as she was greatly troubled at the thought of their being apart , he took his supper with her .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 26]: Finding her still very restless on this head , they made him up a bed in an inner room , to which he presently retired .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 45]: The key of this chamber happened by good fortune to be on that side of the door which was in Nell 's room ; she turned it on him when the landlady had withdrawn , and crept to bed again with a thankful heart .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 83]: The schoolmaster sat for a long time smoking his pipe by the kitchen fire , which was now deserted , thinking , with a very happy face , on the fortunate chance which had brought him so opportunely to the child 's assistance , and parrying , as well as in his simple way he could , the inquisitive cross-examination of the landlady , who had a great curiosity to be made acquainted with every particular of Nell 's life and history .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 53]: The poor schoolmaster was so open-hearted , and so little versed in the most ordinary cunning or deceit , that she could not have failed to succeed in the first five minutes , but that he happened to be unacquainted with what she wished to know ; and so he told her .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 30]: The landlady , by no means satisfied with this assurance , which she considered an ingenious evasion of the question , rejoined that he had his reasons of course .
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 31]: Heaven forbid that she should wish to pry into the affairs of her customers , which indeed were no business of hers , who had so many of her own .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 22]: She had merely asked a civil question , and to be sure she knew it would meet with a civil answer .
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 7]: She was quite satisfied -- quite .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 29]: She had rather perhaps that he would have said at once that he did n't choose to be communicative , because that would have been plain and intelligible .
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 12]: However , she had no right to be offended of course .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 25]: He was the best judge , and had a perfect right to say what he pleased ; nobody could dispute that for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 6]: Oh dear , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 24]: I assure you , my good lady , ' said the mild schoolmaster , ` that I have told you the plain truth .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 15]: As I hope to be saved , I have told you the truth . '
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 32]: ` Why then , I do believe you are in earnest , ' rejoined the landlady , with ready good-humour , ` and I 'm very sorry I have teazed you .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 18]: But curiosity you know is the curse of our sex , and that 's the fact . '
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 47]: The landlord scratched his head , as if he thought the curse sometimes involved the other sex likewise ; but he was prevented from making any remark to that effect , if he had it in contemplation to do so , by the schoolmaster 's rejoinder .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 39]: ` You should question me for half-a-dozen hours at a sitting , and welcome , and I would answer you patiently for the kindness of heart you have shown to-night , if I could , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 36]: ` As it is , please to take care of her in the morning , and let me know early how she is ; and to understand that I am paymaster for the three . '
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 36]: So , parting with them on most friendly terms -LRB- not the less cordial perhaps for this last direction -RRB- , the schoolmaster went to his bed , and the host and hostess to theirs .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 40]: The report in the morning was , that the child was better , but was extremely weak , and would at least require a day 's rest , and careful nursing , before she could proceed upon her journey .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 32]: The schoolmaster received this communication with perfect cheerfulness , observing that he had a day to spare -- two days for that matter -- and could very well afford to wait .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 39]: As the patient was to sit up in the evening , he appointed to visit her in her room at a certain hour , and rambling out with his book , did not return until the hour arrived .
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 63]: Nell could not help weeping when they were left alone ; whereat , and at sight of her pale face and wasted figure , the simple schoolmaster shed a few tears himself , at the same time showing in very energetic language how foolish it was to do so , and how very easily it could be avoided , if one tried .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 30]: ` It makes me unhappy even in the midst of all this kindness ' said the child , ` to think that we should be a burden upon you .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 7]: How can I ever thank you ?
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 25]: If I had not met you so far from home , I must have died , and he would have been left alone . '
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 32]: ` We 'll not talk about dying , ' said the schoolmaster ; ` and as to burdens , I have made my fortune since you slept at my cottage . '
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 4]: ` Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 5]: cried the child joyfully .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 10]: ` Oh yes , ' returned her friend . '
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 35]: I have been appointed clerk and schoolmaster to a village a long way from here -- and a long way from the old one as you may suppose -- at five-and-thirty pounds a year .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 5]: Five-and-thirty pounds ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 19]: I am very glad , ' said the child , ` so very , very glad . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 13]: I am on my way there now , ' resumed the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 13]: ` They allowed me the stage-coach-hire -- outside stage-coach-hire all the way .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 8]: Bless you , they grudge me nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 22]: But as the time at which I am expected there , left me ample leisure , I determined to walk instead .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 12]: How glad I am , to think I did so ! '
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 8]: ` How glad should we be ! '
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 24]: ` Yes , yes , ' said the schoolmaster , moving restlessly in his chair , ` certainly , that 's very true .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 31]: But you -- where are you going , where are you coming from , what have you been doing since you left me , what had you been doing before ?
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 9]: Now , tell me -- do tell me .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 52]: I know very little of the world , and perhaps you are better fitted to advise me in its affairs than I am qualified to give advice to you ; but I am very sincere , and I have a reason -LRB- you have not forgotten it -RRB- for loving you .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 26]: I have felt since that time as if my love for him who died , had been transferred to you who stood beside his bed .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 39]: If this , ' he added , looking upwards , ` is the beautiful creation that springs from ashes , let its peace prosper with me , as I deal tenderly and compassionately by this young child ! '
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 55]: The plain , frank kindness of the honest schoolmaster , the affectionate earnestness of his speech and manner , the truth which was stamped upon his every word and look , gave the child a confidence in him , which the utmost arts of treachery and dissimulation could never have awakened in her breast .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 82]: She told him all -- that they had no friend or relative -- that she had fled with the old man , to save him from a madhouse and all the miseries he dreaded -- that she was flying now , to save him from himself -- and that she sought an asylum in some remote and primitive place , where the temptation before which he fell would never enter , and her late sorrows and distresses could have no place .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 7]: The schoolmaster heard her with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 5]: ` This child ! '
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 35]: -- he thought -- ` Has this child heroically persevered under all doubts and dangers , struggled with poverty and suffering , upheld and sustained by strong affection and the consciousness of rectitude alone !
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 10]: And yet the world is full of such heroism .
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 28]: Have I yet to learn that the hardest and best-borne trials are those which are never chronicled in any earthly record , and are suffered every day !
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 14]: And should I be surprised to hear the story of this child ! '
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 10]: What more he thought or said , matters not .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 36]: It was concluded that Nell and her grandfather should accompany him to the village whither he was bound , and that he should endeavour to find them some humble occupation by which they could subsist .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 15]: ` We shall be sure to succeed , ' said the schoolmaster , heartily .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 12]: ` The cause is too good a one to fail . '
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 51]: They arranged to proceed upon their journey next evening , as a stage-waggon , which travelled for some distance on the same road as they must take , would stop at the inn to change horses , and the driver for a small gratuity would give Nell a place inside .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 58]: A bargain was soon struck when the waggon came ; and in due time it rolled away ; with the child comfortably bestowed among the softer packages , her grandfather and the schoolmaster walking on beside the driver , and the landlady and all the good folks of the inn screaming out their good wishes and farewells .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 87]: What a soothing , luxurious , drowsy way of travelling , to lie inside that slowly-moving mountain , listening to the tinkling of the horses ' bells , the occasional smacking of the carter 's whip , the smooth rolling of the great broad wheels , the rattle of the harness , the cheery good-nights of passing travellers jogging past on little short-stepped horses -- all made pleasantly indistinct by the thick awning , which seemed made for lazy listening under , till one fell asleep !
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 198]: The very going to sleep , still with an indistinct idea , as the head jogged to and fro upon the pillow , of moving onward with no trouble or fatigue , and hearing all these sounds like dreamy music , lulling to the senses -- and the slow waking up , and finding one 's self staring out through the breezy curtain half-opened in the front , far up into the cold bright sky with its countless stars , and downward at the driver 's lantern dancing on like its namesake Jack of the swamps and marshes , and sideways at the dark grim trees , and forward at the long bare road rising up , up , up , until it stopped abruptly at a sharp high ridge as if there were no more road , and all beyond was sky -- and the stopping at the inn to bait , and being helped out , and going into a room with fire and candles , and winking very much , and being agreeably reminded that the night was cold , and anxious for very comfort 's sake to think it colder than it was !
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 12]: -- What a delicious journey was that journey in the waggon .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 17]: Then the going on again -- so fresh at first , and shortly afterwards so sleepy .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 125]: The waking from a sound nap as the mail came dashing past like a highway comet , with gleaming lamps and rattling hoofs , and visions of a guard behind , standing up to keep his feet warm , and of a gentleman in a fur cap opening his eyes and looking wild and stupefied -- the stopping at the turnpike where the man was gone to bed , and knocking at the door until he answered with a smothered shout from under the bed-clothes in the little room above , where the faint light was burning , and presently came down , night-capped and shivering , to throw the gate wide open , and wish all waggons off the road except by day .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 76]: The cold sharp interval between night and morning -- the distant streak of light widening and spreading , and turning from grey to white , and from white to yellow , and from yellow to burning red -- the presence of day , with all its cheerfulness and life -- men and horses at the plough -- birds in the trees and hedges , and boys in solitary fields , frightening them away with rattles .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 146]: The coming to a town -- people busy in the markets ; light carts and chaises round the tavern yard ; tradesmen standing at their doors ; men running horses up and down the street for sale ; pigs plunging and grunting in the dirty distance , getting off with long strings at their legs , running into clean chemists ' shops and being dislodged with brooms by ` prentices ; the night coach changing horses -- the passengers cheerless , cold , ugly , and discontented , with three months ' growth of hair in one night -- the coachman fresh as from a band-box , and exquisitely beautiful by contrast : -- so much bustle , so many things in motion , such a variety of incidents -- when was there a journey with so many delights as that journey in the waggon !
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 55]: Sometimes walking for a mile or two while her grandfather rode inside , and sometimes even prevailing upon the schoolmaster to take her place and lie down to rest , Nell travelled on very happily until they came to a large town , where the waggon stopped , and where they spent a night .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 48]: They passed a large church ; and in the streets were a number of old houses , built of a kind of earth or plaster , crossed and re-crossed in a great many directions with black beams , which gave them a remarkable and very ancient look .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 28]: The doors , too , were arched and low , some with oaken portals and quaint benches , where the former inhabitants had sat on summer evenings .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 26]: The windows were latticed in little diamond panes , that seemed to wink and blink upon the passengers as if they were dim of sight .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 37]: They had long since got clear of the smoke and furnaces , except in one or two solitary instances , where a factory planted among fields withered the space about it , like a burning mountain .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 25]: When they had passed through this town , they entered again upon the country , and began to draw near their place of destination .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 73]: It was not so near , however , but that they spent another night upon the road ; not that their doing so was quite an act of necessity , but that the schoolmaster , when they approached within a few miles of his village , had a fidgety sense of his dignity as the new clerk , and was unwilling to make his entry in dusty shoes , and travel-disordered dress .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 27]: It was a fine , clear , autumn morning , when they came upon the scene of his promotion , and stopped to contemplate its beauties .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 9]: ` See -- here 's the church ! '
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 27]: cried the delighted schoolmaster in a low voice ; ` and that old building close beside it , is the school-house , I 'll be sworn .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 9]: Five-and-thirty pounds a-year in this beautiful place ! '
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 63]: They admired everything -- the old grey porch , the mullioned windows , the venerable gravestones dotting the green churchyard , the ancient tower , the very weathercock ; the brown thatched roofs of cottage , barn , and homestead , peeping from among the trees ; the stream that rippled by the distant water-mill ; the blue Welsh mountains far away .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 21]: It was for such a spot the child had wearied in the dense , dark , miserable haunts of labour .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 44]: Upon her bed of ashes , and amidst the squalid horrors through which they had forced their way , visions of such scenes -- beautiful indeed , but not more beautiful than this sweet reality -- had been always present to her mind .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 39]: They had seemed to melt into a dim and airy distance , as the prospect of ever beholding them again grew fainter ; but , as they receded , she had loved and panted for them more . '
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 30]: I must leave you somewhere for a few minutes , ' said the schoolmaster , at length breaking the silence into which they had fallen in their gladness . '
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 15]: I have a letter to present , and inquiries to make , you know .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 6]: Where shall I take you ?
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 7]: To the little inn yonder ? '
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 10]: ` Let us wait here , ' rejoined Nell .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 6]: ` The gate is open .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 14]: We will sit in the church porch till you come back . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 30]: A good place too , ' said the schoolmaster , leading the way towards it , disencumbering himself of his portmanteau , and placing it on the stone seat .
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 18]: ` Be sure that I come back with good news , and am not long gone ! '
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 37]: So , the happy schoolmaster put on a bran-new pair of gloves which he had carried in a little parcel in his pocket all the way , and hurried off , full of ardour and excitement .
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 59]: The child watched him from the porch until the intervening foliage hid him from her view , and then stepped softly out into the old churchyard -- so solemn and quiet that every rustle of her dress upon the fallen leaves , which strewed the path and made her footsteps noiseless , seemed an invasion of its silence .
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 97]: It was a very aged , ghostly place ; the church had been built many hundreds of years ago , and had once had a convent or monastery attached ; for arches in ruins , remains of oriel windows , and fragments of blackened walls , were yet standing -- , while other portions of the old building , which had crumbled away and fallen down , were mingled with the churchyard earth and overgrown with grass , as if they too claimed a burying-place and sought to mix their ashes with the dust of men .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 48]: Hard by these gravestones of dead years , and forming a part of the ruin which some pains had been taken to render habitable in modern times , were two small dwellings with sunken windows and oaken doors , fast hastening to decay , empty and desolate .
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 13]: Upon these tenements , the attention of the child became exclusively riveted .
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 5]: She knew not why .
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 42]: The church , the ruin , the antiquated graves , had equal claims at least upon a stranger 's thoughts , but from the moment when her eyes first rested on these two dwellings , she could turn to nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 46]: Even when she had made the circuit of the enclosure , and , returning to the porch , sat pensively waiting for their friend , she took her station where she could still look upon them , and felt as if fascinated towards that spot .
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 88]: Chapter 47 Kit 's mother and the single gentleman -- upon whose track it is expedient to follow with hurried steps , lest this history should be chargeable with inconstancy , and the offence of leaving its characters in situations of uncertainty and doubt -- Kit 's mother and the single gentleman , speeding onward in the post-chaise-and-four whose departure from the Notary 's door we have already witnessed , soon left the town behind them , and struck fire from the flints of the broad highway .
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 150]: The good woman , being not a little embarrassed by the novelty of her situation , and certain material apprehensions that perhaps by this time little Jacob , or the baby , or both , had fallen into the fire , or tumbled down stairs , or had been squeezed behind doors , or had scalded their windpipes in endeavouring to allay their thirst at the spouts of tea-kettles , preserved an uneasy silence ; and meeting from the window the eyes of turnpike-men , omnibus-drivers , and others , felt in the new dignity of her position like a mourner at a funeral , who , not being greatly afflicted by the loss of the departed , recognizes his every-day acquaintance from the window of the mourning coach , but is constrained to preserve a decent solemnity , and the appearance of being indifferent to all external objects .
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 23]: To have been indifferent to the companionship of the single gentleman would have been tantamount to being gifted with nerves of steel .
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 16]: Never did chaise inclose , or horses draw , such a restless gentleman as he .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 52]: He never sat in the same position for two minutes together , but was perpetually tossing his arms and legs about , pulling up the sashes and letting them violently down , or thrusting his head out of one window to draw it in again and thrust it out of another .
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 87]: He carried in his pocket , too , a fire-box of mysterious and unknown construction ; and as sure as ever Kit 's mother closed her eyes , so surely -- whisk , rattle , fizz -- there was the single gentleman consulting his watch by a flame of fire , and letting the sparks fall down among the straw as if there were no such thing as a possibility of himself and Kit 's mother being roasted alive before the boys could stop their horses .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 65]: Whenever they halted to change , there he was -- out of the carriage without letting down the steps , bursting about the inn-yard like a lighted cracker , pulling out his watch by lamp-light and forgetting to look at it before he put it up again , and in short committing so many extravagances that Kit 's mother was quite afraid of him .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 53]: Then , when the horses were to , in he came like a Harlequin , and before they had gone a mile , out came the watch and the fire-box together , and Kit 's mother as wide awake again , with no hope of a wink of sleep for that stage .
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 6]: ` Are you comfortable ? '
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 15]: the single gentleman would say after one of these exploits , turning sharply round .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 9]: ` Quite , Sir , thank you . '
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 5]: ` Are you sure ?
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 6]: A n't you cold ? '
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 17]: ` It is a little chilly , Sir , ' Kit 's mother would reply . '
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 5]: I knew it ! '
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 13]: cried the single gentleman , letting down one of the front glasses .
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 8]: ` She wants some brandy and water !
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 5]: Of course she does .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 6]: How could I forget it ?
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 2]: Hallo !
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 19]: Stop at the next inn , and call out for a glass of hot brandy and water . '
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 21]: It was in vain for Kit 's mother to protest that she stood in need of nothing of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 33]: The single gentleman was inexorable ; and whenever he had exhausted all other modes and fashions of restlessness , it invariably occurred to him that Kit 's mother wanted brandy and water .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 59]: In this way they travelled on until near midnight , when they stopped to supper , for which meal the single gentleman ordered everything eatable that the house contained ; and because Kit 's mother did n't eat everything at once , and eat it all , he took it into his head that she must be ill .
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 22]: ` You 're faint , ' said the single gentleman , who did nothing himself but walk about the room . '
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 11]: I see what 's the matter with you , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 5]: You 're faint . '
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 13]: ` Thank you , sir , I 'm not indeed . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 5]: I know you are .
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 6]: I 'm sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 29]: I drag this poor woman from the bosom of her family at a minute 's notice , and she goes on getting fainter and fainter before my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 6]: I 'm a pretty fellow !
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 10]: How many children have you got , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 9]: ` Two , sir , besides Kit . '
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 6]: ` Boys , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 6]: ` Yes , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 6]: ` Are they christened ? '
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 10]: ` Only half baptised as yet , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 9]: ` I 'm godfather to both of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 9]: Remember that , if you please , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 10]: You had better have some mulled wine . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 11]: I could n't touch a drop indeed , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 11]: ` You must , ' said the single gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 6]: I see you want it .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 10]: I ought to have thought of it before . '
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 91]: Immediately flying to the bell , and calling for mulled wine as impetuously as if it had been wanted for instant use in the recovery of some person apparently drowned , the single gentleman made Kit 's mother swallow a bumper of it at such a high temperature that the tears ran down her face , and then hustled her off to the chaise again , where -- not impossibly from the effects of this agreeable sedative -- she soon became insensible to his restlessness , and fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 55]: Nor were the happy effects of this prescription of a transitory nature , as , notwithstanding that the distance was greater , and the journey longer , than the single gentleman had anticipated , she did not awake until it was broad day , and they were clattering over the pavement of a town .
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 7]: ` This is the place ! '
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 10]: cried her companion , letting down all the glasses .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 7]: ` Drive to the wax-work ! '
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 69]: The boy on the wheeler touched his hat , and setting spurs to his horse , to the end that they might go in brilliantly , all four broke into a smart canter , and dashed through the streets with a noise that brought the good folks wondering to their doors and windows , and drowned the sober voices of the town-clocks as they chimed out half-past eight .
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 19]: They drove up to a door round which a crowd of persons were collected , and there stopped .
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 6]: ` What 's this ? '
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 9]: said the single gentleman thrusting out his head .
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 9]: ` Is anything the matter here ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 8]: A wedding Sir , a wedding ! '
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 4]: cried several voices .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 4]: ` Hurrah ! '
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 49]: The single gentleman , rather bewildered by finding himself the centre of this noisy throng , alighted with the assistance of one of the postilions , and handed out Kit 's mother , at sight of whom the populace cried out , ` Here 's another wedding ! '
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 7]: and roared and leaped for joy .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 25]: ` The world has gone mad , I think , ' said the single gentleman , pressing through the concourse with his supposed bride .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 14]: ` Stand back here , will you , and let me knock . '
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 11]: Anything that makes a noise is satisfactory to a crowd .
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 38]: A score of dirty hands were raised directly to knock for him , and seldom has a knocker of equal powers been made to produce more deafening sounds than this particular engine on the occasion in question .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 24]: Having rendered these voluntary services , the throng modestly retired a little , preferring that the single gentleman should bear their consequences alone .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 11]: ` Now , sir , what do you want ! '
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 25]: said a man with a large white bow at his button-hole , opening the door , and confronting him with a very stoical aspect .
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 11]: ` Who has been married here , my friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 6]: said the single gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 4]: I have . '
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 3]: ` You !
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 10]: and to whom in the devil 's name ? '
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 9]: ` What right have you to ask ? '
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 11]: returned the bridegroom , eyeing him from top to toe .
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 5]: ` What right ! '
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 32]: cried the single gentleman , drawing the arm of Kit 's mother more tightly through his own , for that good woman evidently had it in contemplation to run away . '
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 7]: A right you little dream of .
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 23]: Mind , good people , if this fellow has been marrying a minor -- tut , tut , that ca n't be .
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 12]: Where is the child you have here , my good fellow .
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 5]: You call her Nell .
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 5]: Where is she ? '
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 48]: As he propounded this question , which Kit 's mother echoed , somebody in a room near at hand , uttered a great shriek , and a stout lady in a white dress came running to the door , and supported herself upon the bridegroom 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 6]: ` Where is she ! '
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 4]: cried this lady .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 8]: ` What news have you brought me ?
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 7]: What has become of her ? '
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 49]: The single gentleman started back , and gazed upon the face of the late Mrs Jarley -LRB- that morning wedded to the philosophic George , to the eternal wrath and despair of Mr Slum the poet -RRB- , with looks of conflicting apprehension , disappointment , and incredulity .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 14]: At length he stammered out , ' I ask YOU where she is ?
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 6]: What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 5]: ` Oh sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 26]: cried the bride , ` If you have come here to do her any good , why were n't you here a week ago ? '
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 9]: ` She is not -- not dead ? '
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 13]: said the person to whom she addressed herself , turning very pale .
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 11]: ` No , not so bad as that . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 5]: I thank God ! '
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 6]: cried the single gentleman feebly .
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 7]: ` Let me come in . '
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 17]: They drew back to admit him , and when he had entered , closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 36]: ` You see in me , good people , ' he said , turning to the newly-married couple , ` one to whom life itself is not dearer than the two persons whom I seek .
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 6]: They would not know me .
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 37]: My features are strange to them , but if they or either of them are here , take this good woman with you , and let them see her first , for her they both know .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 31]: If you deny them from any mistaken regard or fear for them , judge of my intentions by their recognition of this person as their old humble friend . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 6]: I always said it ! '
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 14]: cried the bride , ' I knew she was not a common child !
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 4]: Alas , sir !
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 22]: we have no power to help you , for all that we could do , has been tried in vain . '
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 96]: With that , they related to him , without disguise or concealment , all that they knew of Nell and her grandfather , from their first meeting with them , down to the time of their sudden disappearance ; adding -LRB- which was quite true -RRB- that they had made every possible effort to trace them , but without success ; having been at first in great alarm for their safety , as well as on account of the suspicions to which they themselves might one day be exposed in consequence of their abrupt departure .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 54]: They dwelt upon the old man 's imbecility of mind , upon the uneasiness the child had always testified when he was absent , upon the company he had been supposed to keep , and upon the increased depression which had gradually crept over her and changed her both in health and spirits .
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 43]: Whether she had missed the old man in the night , and knowing or conjecturing whither he had bent his steps , had gone in pursuit , or whether they had left the house together , they had no means of determining .
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 43]: Certain they considered it , that there was but slender prospect left of hearing of them again , and that whether their flight originated with the old man , or with the child , there was now no hope of their return .
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 22]: To all this , the single gentleman listened with the air of a man quite borne down by grief and disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 16]: He shed tears when they spoke of the grandfather , and appeared in deep affliction .
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 78]: Not to protract this portion of our narrative , and to make short work of a long story , let it be briefly written that before the interview came to a close , the single gentleman deemed he had sufficient evidence of having been told the truth , and that he endeavoured to force upon the bride and bridegroom an acknowledgment of their kindness to the unfriended child , which , however , they steadily declined accepting .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 35]: In the end , the happy couple jolted away in the caravan to spend their honeymoon in a country excursion ; and the single gentleman and Kit 's mother stood ruefully before their carriage-door .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 10]: ` Where shall we drive you , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 4]: said the post-boy .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 46]: ` You may drive me , ' said the single gentleman , ` to the -- ' He was not going to add ` inn , ' but he added it for the sake of Kit 's mother ; and to the inn they went .
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 39]: Rumours had already got abroad that the little girl who used to show the wax-work , was the child of great people who had been stolen from her parents in infancy , and had only just been traced .
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 75]: Opinion was divided whether she was the daughter of a prince , a duke , an earl , a viscount , or a baron , but all agreed upon the main fact , and that the single gentleman was her father ; and all bent forward to catch a glimpse , though it were only of the tip of his noble nose , as he rode away , desponding , in his four-horse chaise .
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 44]: What would he have given to know , and what sorrow would have been saved if he had only known , that at that moment both child and grandfather were seated in the old church porch , patiently awaiting the schoolmaster 's return !
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 139]: Chapter 48 Popular rumour concerning the single gentleman and his errand , travelling from mouth to mouth , and waxing stronger in the marvellous as it was bandied about -- for your popular rumour , unlike the rolling stone of the proverb , is one which gathers a deal of moss in its wanderings up and down -- occasioned his dismounting at the inn-door to be looked upon as an exciting and attractive spectacle , which could scarcely be enough admired ; and drew together a large concourse of idlers , who having recently been , as it were , thrown out of employment by the closing of the wax-work and the completion of the nuptial ceremonies , considered his arrival as little else than a special providence , and hailed it with demonstrations of the liveliest joy .
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 51]: Not at all participating in the general sensation , but wearing the depressed and wearied look of one who sought to meditate on his disappointment in silence and privacy , the single gentleman alighted , and handed out Kit 's mother with a gloomy politeness which impressed the lookers-on extremely .
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 43]: That done , he gave her his arm and escorted her into the house , while several active waiters ran on before as a skirmishing party , to clear the way and to show the room which was ready for their reception .
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 12]: ` Any room will do , ' said the single gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 13]: ` Let it be near at hand , that 's all . '
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 15]: ` Close here , sir , if you please to walk this way . '
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 9]: ` Would the gentleman like this room ? '
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 25]: said a voice , as a little out-of-the-way door at the foot of the well staircase flew briskly open and a head popped out .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 8]: ` He 's quite welcome to it .
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 14]: He 's as welcome as flowers in May , or coals at Christmas .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 8]: Would you like this room , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 6]: Honour me by walking in .
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 8]: Do me the favour , pray . '
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 6]: ` Goodness gracious me ! '
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 18]: cried Kit 's mother , falling back in extreme surprise , ` only think of this ! '
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 23]: She had some reason to be astonished , for the person who proffered the gracious invitation was no other than Daniel Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 77]: The little door out of which he had thrust his head was close to the inn larder ; and there he stood , bowing with grotesque politeness ; as much at his ease as if the door were that of his own house ; blighting all the legs of mutton and cold roast fowls by his close companionship , and looking like the evil genius of the cellars come from underground upon some work of mischief .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 9]: ` Would you do me the honour ? '
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 4]: said Quilp . '
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 11]: I prefer being alone , ' replied the single gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 3]: said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 30]: And with that , he darted in again with one jerk and clapped the little door to , like a figure in a Dutch clock when the hour strikes .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 26]: ` Why it was only last night , sir , ' whispered Kit 's mother , ` that I left him in Little Bethel . '
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 4]: ` Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 4]: said her fellow-passenger .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 11]: ` When did that person come here , waiter ? '
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 13]: ` Come down by the night-coach , this morning , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 3]: ` Humph !
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 7]: And when is he going ? '
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 9]: ` Ca n't say , sir , really .
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 31]: When the chambermaid asked him just now if he should want a bed , sir , he first made faces at her , and then wanted to kiss her . '
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 15]: ` Beg him to walk this way , ' said the single gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 14]: I should be glad to exchange a word with him , tell him .
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 12]: Beg him to come at once , do you hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 50]: The man stared on receiving these instructions , for the single gentleman had not only displayed as much astonishment as Kit 's mother at sight of the dwarf , but , standing in no fear of him , had been at less pains to conceal his dislike and repugnance .
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 17]: He departed on his errand , however , and immediately returned , ushering in its object .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 18]: ` Your servant , sir , ' said the dwarf , ' I encountered your messenger half-way .
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 13]: I thought you 'd allow me to pay my compliments to you .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 6]: I hope you 're well .
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 8]: I hope you 're very well . '
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 23]: There was a short pause , while the dwarf , with half-shut eyes and puckered face , stood waiting for an answer .
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 11]: Receiving none , he turned towards his more familiar acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 6]: ` Christopher 's mother ! '
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 18]: ` Such a dear lady , such a worthy woman , so blest in her honest son !
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 6]: How is Christopher 's mother ?
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 9]: Have change of air and scene improved her ?
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 8]: Her little family too , and Christopher ?
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 4]: Do they thrive ?
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 4]: Do they flourish ?
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 10]: Are they growing into worthy citizens , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 75]: Making his voice ascend in the scale with every succeeding question , Mr Quilp finished in a shrill squeak , and subsided into the panting look which was customary with him , and which , whether it were assumed or natural , had equally the effect of banishing all expression from his face , and rendering it , as far as it afforded any index to his mood or meaning , a perfect blank .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 10]: ` Mr Quilp , ' said the single gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 17]: The dwarf put his hand to his great flapped ear , and counterfeited the closest attention .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 19]: ` We two have met before -- ' ` Surely , ' cried Quilp , nodding his head .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 6]: ` Oh surely , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 26]: Such an honour and pleasure -- it 's both , Christopher 's mother , it 's both -- is not to be forgotten so soon .
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 5]: By no means ! '
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 48]: ` You may remember that the day I arrived in London , and found the house to which I drove , empty and deserted , I was directed by some of the neighbours to you , and waited upon you without stopping for rest or refreshment ? '
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 16]: ` How precipitate that was , and yet what an earnest and vigorous measure ! '
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 17]: said Quilp , conferring with himself , in imitation of his friend Mr Sampson Brass . '
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 63]: I found , ' said the single gentleman , ` you most unaccountably , in possession of everything that had so recently belonged to another man , and that other man , who up to the time of your entering upon his property had been looked upon as affluent , reduced to sudden beggary , and driven from house and home . '
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 23]: ` We had warrant for what we did , my good sir , ' rejoined Quilp , ` we had our warrant .
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 6]: Do n't say driven either .
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 15]: He went of his own accord -- vanished in the night , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 11]: ` No matter , ' said the single gentleman angrily .
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 6]: ` He was gone . '
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 17]: ` Yes , he was gone , ' said Quilp , with the same exasperating composure .
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 7]: ` No doubt he was gone .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 7]: The only question was , where .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 8]: And it 's a question still . '
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 62]: ` Now , what am I to think , ' said the single gentleman , sternly regarding him , ` of you , who , plainly indisposed to give me any information then -- nay , obviously holding back , and sheltering yourself with all kinds of cunning , trickery , and evasion -- are dogging my footsteps now ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 4]: I dogging ! '
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 3]: cried Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 8]: ` Why , are you not ? '
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 13]: returned his questioner , fretted into a state of the utmost irritation .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 29]: ` Were you not a few hours since , sixty miles off , and in the chapel to which this good woman goes to say her prayers ? '
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 10]: ` She was there too , I think ? '
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 8]: said Quilp , still perfectly unmoved . '
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 23]: I might say , if I was inclined to be rude , how do I know but you are dogging MY footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 7]: Yes , I was at chapel .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 3]: What then ?
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 28]: I 've read in books that pilgrims were used to go to chapel before they went on journeys , to put up petitions for their safe return .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 3]: Wise men !
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 10]: journeys are very perilous -- especially outside the coach .
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 16]: Wheels come off , horses take fright , coachmen drive too fast , coaches overturn .
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 11]: I always go to chapel before I start on journeys .
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 14]: It 's the last thing I do on such occasions , indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 51]: That Quilp lied most heartily in this speech , it needed no very great penetration to discover , although for anything that he suffered to appear in his face , voice , or manner , he might have been clinging to the truth with the quiet constancy of a martyr .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 41]: ` In the name of all that 's calculated to drive one crazy , man , ' said the unfortunate single gentleman , ` have you not , for some reason of your own , taken upon yourself my errand ?
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 27]: do n't you know with what object I have come here , and if you do know , can you throw no light upon it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 19]: ` You think I 'm a conjuror , sir , ' replied Quilp , shrugging up his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 17]: ` If I was , I should tell my own fortune -- and make it . '
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 23]: we have said all we need say , I see , ' returned the other , throwing himself impatiently upon a sofa .
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 10]: ` Pray leave us , if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 7]: ` Willingly , ' returned Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 4]: ` Most willingly .
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 10]: Christopher 's mother , my good soul , farewell .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 8]: A pleasant journey -- back , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 3]: Ahem ! '
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 44]: With these parting words , and with a grin upon his features altogether indescribable , but which seemed to be compounded of every monstrous grimace of which men or monkeys are capable , the dwarf slowly retreated and closed the door behind him .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 4]: ` Oho ! '
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 22]: he said when he had regained his own room , and sat himself down in a chair with his arms akimbo .
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 3]: ` Oho !
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 7]: Are you there , my friend ?
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 3]: In-deed ! '
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 68]: Chuckling as though in very great glee , and recompensing himself for the restraint he had lately put upon his countenance by twisting it into all imaginable varieties of ugliness , Mr Quilp , rocking himself to and fro in his chair and nursing his left leg at the same time , fell into certain meditations , of which it may be necessary to relate the substance .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 21]: First , he reviewed the circumstances which had led to his repairing to that spot , which were briefly these .
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 68]: Dropping in at Mr Sampson Brass 's office on the previous evening , in the absence of that gentleman and his learned sister , he had lighted upon Mr Swiveller , who chanced at the moment to be sprinkling a glass of warm gin and water on the dust of the law , and to be moistening his clay , as the phrase goes , rather copiously .
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 84]: But as clay in the abstract , when too much moistened , becomes of a weak and uncertain consistency , breaking down in unexpected places , retaining impressions but faintly , and preserving no strength or steadiness of character , so Mr Swiveller 's clay , having imbibed a considerable quantity of moisture , was in a very loose and slippery state , insomuch that the various ideas impressed upon it were fast losing their distinctive character , and running into each other .
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 78]: It is not uncommon for human clay in this condition to value itself above all things upon its great prudence and sagacity ; and Mr Swiveller , especially prizing himself upon these qualities , took occasion to remark that he had made strange discoveries in connection with the single gentleman who lodged above , which he had determined to keep within his own bosom , and which neither tortures nor cajolery should ever induce him to reveal .
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 54]: Of this determination Mr Quilp expressed his high approval , and setting himself in the same breath to goad Mr Swiveller on to further hints , soon made out that the single gentleman had been seen in communication with Kit , and that this was the secret which was never to be disclosed .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 70]: Possessed of this piece of information , Mr Quilp directly supposed that the single gentleman above stairs must be the same individual who had waited on him , and having assured himself by further inquiries that this surmise was correct , had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that the intent and object of his correspondence with Kit was the recovery of his old client and the child .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 58]: Burning with curiosity to know what proceedings were afoot , he resolved to pounce upon Kit 's mother as the person least able to resist his arts , and consequently the most likely to be entrapped into such revelations as he sought ; so taking an abrupt leave of Mr Swiveller , he hurried to her house .
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 45]: The good woman being from home , he made inquiries of a neighbour , as Kit himself did soon afterwards , and being directed to the chapel be took himself there , in order to waylay her , at the conclusion of the service .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 42]: He had not sat in the chapel more than a quarter of an hour , and with his eyes piously fixed upon the ceiling was chuckling inwardly over the joke of his being there at all , when Kit himself appeared .
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 17]: Watchful as a lynx , one glance showed the dwarf that he had come on business .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 36]: Absorbed in appearance , as we have seen , and feigning a profound abstraction , he noted every circumstance of his behaviour , and when he withdrew with his family , shot out after him .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 71]: In fine , he traced them to the notary 's house ; learnt the destination of the carriage from one of the postilions ; and knowing that a fast night-coach started for the same place , at the very hour which was on the point of striking , from a street hard by , darted round to the coach-office without more ado , and took his seat upon the roof .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 49]: After passing and repassing the carriage on the road , and being passed and repassed by it sundry times in the course of the night , according as their stoppages were longer or shorter ; or their rate of travelling varied , they reached the town almost together .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 69]: Quilp kept the chaise in sight , mingled with the crowd , learnt the single gentleman 's errand , and its failure , and having possessed himself of all that it was material to know , hurried off , reached the inn before him , had the interview just now detailed , and shut himself up in the little room in which he hastily reviewed all these occurrences .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 12]: ` You are there , are you , my friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 9]: he repeated , greedily biting his nails . '
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 17]: I am suspected and thrown aside , and Kit 's the confidential agent , is he ?
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 11]: I shall have to dispose of him , I fear .
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 30]: If we had come up with them this morning , ' he continued , after a thoughtful pause , ' I was ready to prove a pretty good claim .
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 7]: I could have made my profit .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 34]: But for these canting hypocrites , the lad and his mother , I could get this fiery gentleman as comfortably into my net as our old friend -- our mutual friend , ha !
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 7]: -- and chubby , rosy Nell .
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 15]: At the worst , it 's a golden opportunity , not to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 43]: Let us find them first , and I 'll find means of draining you of some of your superfluous cash , sir , while there are prison bars , and bolts , and locks , to keep your friend or kinsman safely .
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 7]: I hate your virtuous people ! '
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 19]: said the dwarf , throwing off a bumper of brandy , and smacking his lips , ` ah !
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 7]: I hate 'em every one ! '
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 104]: This was not a mere empty vaunt , but a deliberate avowal of his real sentiments ; for Mr Quilp , who loved nobody , had by little and little come to hate everybody nearly or remotely connected with his ruined client : -- the old man himself , because he had been able to deceive him and elude his vigilance -- the child , because she was the object of Mrs Quilp 's commiseration and constant self-reproach -- the single gentleman , because of his unconcealed aversion to himself -- Kit and his mother , most mortally , for the reasons shown .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 35]: Above and beyond that general feeling of opposition to them , which would have been inseparable from his ravenous desire to enrich himself by these altered circumstances , Daniel Quilp hated them every one .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 53]: In this amiable mood , Mr Quilp enlivened himself and his hatreds with more brandy , and then , changing his quarters , withdrew to an obscure alehouse , under cover of which seclusion he instituted all possible inquiries that might lead to the discovery of the old man and his grandchild .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 6]: But all was in vain .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 10]: Not the slightest trace or clue could be obtained .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 55]: They had left the town by night ; no one had seen them go ; no one had met them on the road ; the driver of no coach , cart , or waggon , had seen any travellers answering their description ; nobody had fallen in with them , or heard of them .
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 44]: Convinced at last that for the present all such attempts were hopeless , he appointed two or three scouts , with promises of large rewards in case of their forwarding him any intelligence , and returned to London by next day 's coach .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 197]: It was some gratification to Mr Quilp to find , as he took his place upon the roof , that Kit 's mother was alone inside ; from which circumstance he derived in the course of the journey much cheerfulness of spirit , inasmuch as her solitary condition enabled him to terrify her with many extraordinary annoyances ; such as hanging over the side of the coach at the risk of his life , and staring in with his great goggle eyes , which seemed in hers the more horrible from his face being upside down ; dodging her in this way from one window to another ; getting nimbly down whenever they changed horses and thrusting his head in at the window with a dismal squint : which ingenious tortures had such an effect upon Mrs Nubbles , that she was quite unable for the time to resist the belief that Mr Quilp did in his own person represent and embody that Evil Power , who was so vigorously attacked at Little Bethel , and who , by reason of her backslidings in respect of Astley 's and oysters , was now frolicsome and rampant .
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 55]: Kit , having been apprised by letter of his mother 's intended return , was waiting for her at the coach-office ; and great was his surprise when he saw , leering over the coachman 's shoulder like some familiar demon , invisible to all eyes but his , the well-known face of Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 8]: ` How are you , Christopher ? '
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 7]: croaked the dwarf from the coach-top .
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 6]: ` All right , Christopher .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 5]: Mother 's inside . '
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 12]: ` Why , how did he come here , mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 4]: whispered Kit . '
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 45]: I do n't know how he came or why , my dear , ' rejoined Mrs Nubbles , dismounting with her son 's assistance , ` but he has been a terrifying of me out of my seven senses all this blessed day . '
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 5]: ` He has ? '
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 3]: cried Kit .
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 37]: ` You would n't believe it , that you would n't , ' replied his mother , ` but do n't say a word to him , for I really do n't believe he 's human .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 32]: Do n't turn round as if I was talking of him , but he 's a squinting at me now in the full blaze of the coach-lamp , quite awful ! '
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 15]: In spite of his mother 's injunction , Kit turned sharply round to look .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 15]: Mr Quilp was serenely gazing at the stars , quite absorbed in celestial contemplation .
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 10]: ` Oh , he 's the artfullest creetur ! '
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 4]: cried Mrs Nubbles .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 5]: ` But come away .
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 10]: Do n't speak to him for the world . '
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 7]: ` Yes I will , mother .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 3]: What nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 17]: I say , sir -- ' Mr Quilp affected to start , and looked smilingly round .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 11]: ` You let my mother alone , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 3]: said Kit .
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 32]: ` How dare you tease a poor lone woman like her , making her miserable and melancholy as if she had n't got enough to make her so , without you .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 12]: A n't you ashamed of yourself , you little monster ? '
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 4]: ` Monster ! '
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 8]: said Quilp inwardly , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 17]: ` Ugliest dwarf that could be seen anywhere for a penny -- monster -- ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 37]: ` You show her any of your impudence again , ' resumed Kit , shouldering the bandbox , ` and I tell you what , Mr Quilp , I wo n't bear with you any more .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 17]: You have no right to do it ; I 'm sure we never interfered with you .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 43]: This is n't the first time ; and if ever you worry or frighten her again , you 'll oblige me -LRB- though I should be very sorry to do it , on account of your size -RRB- to beat you . '
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 62]: Quilp said not a word in reply , but walking so close to Kit as to bring his eyes within two or three inches of his face , looked fixedly at him , retreated a little distance without averting his gaze , approached again , again withdrew , and so on for half-a-dozen times , like a head in a phantasmagoria .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 68]: Kit stood his ground as if in expectation of an immediate assault , but finding that nothing came of these gestures , snapped his fingers and walked away ; his mother dragging him off as fast as she could , and , even in the midst of his news of little Jacob and the baby , looking anxiously over her shoulder to see if Quilp were following .
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 46]: Chapter 49 Kit 's mother might have spared herself the trouble of looking back so often , for nothing was further from Mr Quilp 's thoughts than any intention of pursuing her and her son , or renewing the quarrel with which they had parted .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 92]: He went his way , whistling from time to time some fragments of a tune ; and with a face quite tranquil and composed , jogged pleasantly towards home ; entertaining himself as he went with visions of the fears and terrors of Mrs Quilp , who , having received no intelligence of him for three whole days and two nights , and having had no previous notice of his absence , was doubtless by that time in a state of distraction , and constantly fainting away with anxiety and grief .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 87]: This facetious probability was so congenial to the dwarf 's humour , and so exquisitely amusing to him , that he laughed as he went along until the tears ran down his cheeks ; and more than once , when he found himself in a bye-street , vented his delight in a shrill scream , which greatly terrifying any lonely passenger , who happened to be walking on before him expecting nothing so little , increased his mirth , and made him remarkably cheerful and light-hearted .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 40]: In this happy flow of spirits , Mr Quilp reached Tower Hill , when , gazing up at the window of his own sitting-room , he thought he descried more light than is usual in a house of mourning .
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 37]: Drawing nearer , and listening attentively , he could hear several voices in earnest conversation , among which he could distinguish , not only those of his wife and mother-in-law , but the tongues of men .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 4]: ` Ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 10]: cried the jealous dwarf , ` What 's this !
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 10]: Do they entertain visitors while I 'm away ! '
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 10]: A smothered cough from above , was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 14]: He felt in his pockets for his latch-key , but had forgotten it .
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 12]: There was no resource but to knock at the door . '
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 16]: A light in the passage , ' said Quilp , peeping through the keyhole . '
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 22]: A very soft knock ; and , by your leave , my lady , I may yet steal upon you unawares .
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 3]: Soho ! '
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 12]: A very low and gentle rap received no answer from within .
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 44]: But after a second application to the knocker , no louder than the first , the door was softly opened by the boy from the wharf , whom Quilp instantly gagged with one hand , and dragged into the street with the other .
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 13]: ` You 'll throttle me , master , ' whispered the boy .
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 8]: ` Let go , will you . '
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 10]: ` Who 's up stairs , you dog ? '
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 7]: retorted Quilp in the same tone .
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 4]: ` Tell me .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 18]: And do n't speak above your breath , or I 'll choke you in good earnest . '
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 97]: The boy could only point to the window , and reply with a stifled giggle , expressive of such intense enjoyment , that Quilp clutched him by the throat and might have carried his threat into execution , or at least have made very good progress towards that end , but for the boy 's nimbly extricating himself from his grasp , and fortifying himself behind the nearest post , at which , after some fruitless attempts to catch him by the hair of the head , his master was obliged to come to a parley .
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 7]: ` Will you answer me ? '
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 3]: said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 9]: ` What 's going on , above ? '
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 13]: ` You wo n't let one speak , ' replied the boy .
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 9]: ` They -- ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 10]: -- they think you 're -- you 're dead .
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 5]: Ha ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 4]: ` Dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 10]: cried Quilp , relaxing into a grim laugh himself .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 3]: Do they ?
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 8]: Do they really , you dog ? '
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 28]: ` They think you 're -- you 're drowned , ' replied the boy , who in his malicious nature had a strong infusion of his master .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 19]: ` You was last seen on the brink of the wharf , and they think you tumbled over .
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 4]: Ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 40]: The prospect of playing the spy under such delicious circumstances , and of disappointing them all by walking in alive , gave more delight to Quilp than the greatest stroke of good fortune could possibly have inspired him with .
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 44]: He was no less tickled than his hopeful assistant , and they both stood for some seconds , grinning and gasping and wagging their heads at each other , on either side of the post , like an unmatchable pair of Chinese idols .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 16]: ` Not a word , ' said Quilp , making towards the door on tiptoe .
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 20]: ` Not a sound , not so much as a creaking board , or a stumble against a cobweb .
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 7]: Drowned , eh , Mrs Quilp !
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 3]: Drowned ! '
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 35]: So saying , he blew out the candle , kicked off his shoes , and groped his way up stairs ; leaving his delighted young friend in an ecstasy of summersets on the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 81]: The bedroom-door on the staircase being unlocked , Mr Quilp slipped in , and planted himself behind the door of communication between that chamber and the sitting-room , which standing ajar to render both more airy , and having a very convenient chink -LRB- of which he had often availed himself for purposes of espial , and had indeed enlarged with his pocket-knife -RRB- , enabled him not only to hear , but to see distinctly , what was passing .
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 125]: Applying his eye to this convenient place , he descried Mr Brass seated at the table with pen , ink , and paper , and the case-bottle of rum -- his own case-bottle , and his own particular Jamaica -- convenient to his hand ; with hot water , fragrant lemons , white lump sugar , and all things fitting ; from which choice materials , Sampson , by no means insensible to their claims upon his attention , had compounded a mighty glass of punch reeking hot ; which he was at that very moment stirring up with a teaspoon , and contemplating with looks in which a faint assumption of sentimental regret , struggled but weakly with a bland and comfortable joy .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 89]: At the same table , with both her elbows upon it , was Mrs Jiniwin ; no longer sipping other people 's punch feloniously with teaspoons , but taking deep draughts from a jorum of her own ; while her daughter -- not exactly with ashes on her head , or sackcloth on her back , but preserving a very decent and becoming appearance of sorrow nevertheless -- was reclining in an easy chair , and soothing her grief with a smaller allowance of the same glib liquid .
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 73]: There were also present , a couple of water-side men , bearing between them certain machines called drags ; even these fellows were accommodated with a stiff glass a-piece ; and as they drank with a great relish , and were naturally of a red-nosed , pimple-faced , convivial look , their presence rather increased than detracted from that decided appearance of comfort , which was the great characteristic of the party .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 25]: ` If I could poison that dear old lady 's rum and water , ' murmured Quilp , ` I 'd die happy . '
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 32]: said Mr Brass , breaking the silence , and raising his eyes to the ceiling with a sigh , ` Who knows but he may be looking down upon us now !
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 24]: Who knows but he may be surveying of us from -- from somewheres or another , and contemplating us with a watchful eye !
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 4]: Oh Lor ! '
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 30]: Here Mr Brass stopped to drink half his punch , and then resumed ; looking at the other half , as he spoke , with a dejected smile . '
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 29]: I can almost fancy , ' said the lawyer shaking his head , ` that I see his eye glistening down at the very bottom of my liquor .
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 9]: When shall we look upon his like again ?
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 5]: Never , never ! '
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 43]: One minute we are here ' -- holding his tumbler before his eyes -- ` the next we are there ' -- gulping down its contents , and striking himself emphatically a little below the chest -- ` in the silent tomb .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 11]: To think that I should be drinking his very rum !
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 7]: It seems like a dream . '
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 40]: With the view , no doubt , of testing the reality of his position , Mr Brass pushed his tumbler as he spoke towards Mrs Jiniwin for the purpose of being replenished ; and turned towards the attendant mariners .
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 10]: ` The search has been quite unsuccessful then ? '
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 5]: ` Quite , master .
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 29]: But I should say that if he turns up anywhere , he 'll come ashore somewhere about Grinidge to-morrow , at ebb tide , eh , mate ? '
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 28]: The other gentleman assented , observing that he was expected at the Hospital , and that several pensioners would be ready to receive him whenever he arrived .
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 22]: ` Then we have nothing for it but resignation , ' said Mr Brass ; ` nothing but resignation and expectation .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 18]: It would be a comfort to have his body ; it would be a dreary comfort . '
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 27]: ` Oh , beyond a doubt , ' assented Mrs Jiniwin hastily ; ` if we once had that , we should be quite sure . '
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 18]: ` With regard to the descriptive advertisement , ' said Sampson Brass , taking up his pen .
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 11]: ` It is a melancholy pleasure to recall his traits .
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 7]: Respecting his legs now -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 10]: ` Crooked , certainly , ' said Mrs Jiniwin .
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 9]: ` Do you think they WERE crooked ? '
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 9]: said Brass , in an insinuating tone . '
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 25]: I think I see them now coming up the street very wide apart , in nankeen ' pantaloons a little shrunk and without straps .
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 9]: what a vale of tears we live in .
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 7]: Do we say crooked ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 16]: I think they were a little so , ' observed Mrs Quilp with a sob .
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 13]: ` Legs crooked , ' said Brass , writing as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 19]: ` Large head , short body , legs crooked -- ' Very crooked , ' suggested Mrs Jiniwin .
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 15]: ` We 'll not say very crooked , ma'am , ' said Brass piously .
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 13]: ` Let us not bear hard upon the weaknesses of the deceased .
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 16]: He is gone , ma'am , to where his legs will never come in question .
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 13]: -- We will content ourselves with crooked , Mrs Jiniwin . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 13]: I thought you wanted the truth , ' said the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 6]: ` That 's all . '
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 14]: ` Bless your eyes , how I love you , ' muttered Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 6]: ` There she goes again .
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 5]: Nothing but punch ! '
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 47]: ` This is an occupation , ' said the lawyer , laying down his pen and emptying his glass , ` which seems to bring him before my eyes like the Ghost of Hamlet 's father , in the very clothes that he wore on work-a-days .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 38]: His coat , his waistcoat , his shoes and stockings , his trousers , his hat , his wit and humour , his pathos and his umbrella , all come before me like visions of my youth .
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 4]: His linen ! '
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 37]: said Mr Brass smiling fondly at the wall , ` his linen which was always of a particular colour , for such was his whim and fancy -- how plain I see his linen now ! '
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 15]: ` You had better go on , sir , ' said Mrs Jiniwin impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 12]: ` True , ma'am , true , ' cried Mr Brass .
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 9]: ` Our faculties must not freeze with grief .
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 13]: I 'll trouble you for a little more of that , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 12]: A question now arises , with relation to his nose . '
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 8]: ` Flat , ' said Mrs Jiniwin .
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 4]: ` Aquiline ! '
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 16]: cried Quilp , thrusting in his head , and striking the feature with his fist .
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 6]: ` Aquiline , you hag .
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 5]: Do you see it ?
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 6]: Do you call this flat ?
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 3]: Do you ?
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 3]: Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 7]: ` Oh capital , capital ! '
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 10]: shouted Brass , from the mere force of habit .
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 3]: ` Excellent !
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 6]: How very good he is !
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 11]: He 's a most remarkable man -- so extremely whimsical !
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 11]: Such an amazing power of taking people by surprise ! '
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 51]: Quilp paid no regard whatever to these compliments , nor to the dubious and frightened look into which the lawyer gradually subsided , nor to the shrieks of his wife and mother-in-law , nor to the latter 's running from the room , nor to the former 's fainting away .
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 59]: Keeping his eye fixed on Sampson Brass , he walked up to the table , and beginning with his glass , drank off the contents , and went regularly round until he had emptied the other two , when he seized the case-bottle , and hugging it under his arm , surveyed him with a most extraordinary leer .
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 10]: ` Not yet , Sampson , ' said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 6]: ` Not just yet ! '
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 7]: ` Oh very good indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 9]: cried Brass , recovering his spirits a little .
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 5]: ` Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 4]: Oh exceedingly good !
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 14]: There 's not another man alive who could carry it off like that .
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 8]: A most difficult position to carry off .
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 15]: But he has such a flow of good-humour , such an amazing flow ! '
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 12]: ` Good night , ' said the dwarf , nodding expressively .
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 20]: ` Good night , sir , good night , ' cried the lawyer , retreating backwards towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 11]: ` This is a joyful occasion indeed , extremely joyful .
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 4]: Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 12]: oh very rich , very rich indeed , remarkably so ! '
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 44]: Waiting until Mr Brass 's ejaculations died away in the distance -LRB- for he continued to pour them out , all the way down stairs -RRB- , Quilp advanced towards the two men , who yet lingered in a kind of stupid amazement .
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 13]: ` Have you been dragging the river all day , gentlemen ? '
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 12]: said the dwarf , holding the door open with great politeness .
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 8]: ` And yesterday too , master . '
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 12]: ` Dear me , you 've had a deal of trouble .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 14]: Pray consider everything yours that you find upon the -- upon the body .
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 4]: Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 26]: The men looked at each other , but had evidently no inclination to argue the point just then , and shuffled out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 33]: The speedy clearance effected , Quilp locked the doors ; and still embracing the case-bottle with shrugged-up shoulders and folded arms , stood looking at his insensible wife like a dismounted nightmare .
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 29]: Chapter 50 Matrimonial differences are usually discussed by the parties concerned in the form of dialogue , in which the lady bears at least her full half share .
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 65]: Those of Mr and Mrs Quilp , however , were an exception to the general rule ; the remarks which they occasioned being limited to a long soliloquy on the part of the gentleman , with perhaps a few deprecatory observations from the lady , not extending beyond a trembling monosyllable uttered at long intervals , and in a very submissive and humble tone .
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 46]: On the present occasion , Mrs Quilp did not for a long time venture even on this gentle defence , but when she had recovered from her fainting-fit , sat in a tearful silence , meekly listening to the reproaches of her lord and master .
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 46]: Of these Mr Quilp delivered himself with the utmost animation and rapidity , and with so many distortions of limb and feature , that even his wife , although tolerably well accustomed to his proficiency in these respects , was well-nigh beside herself with alarm .
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 45]: But the Jamaica rum , and the joy of having occasioned a heavy disappointment , by degrees cooled Mr Quilp 's wrath ; which from being at savage heat , dropped slowly to the bantering or chuckling point , at which it steadily remained .
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 14]: ` So you thought I was dead and gone , did you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 3]: said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 10]: ` You thought you were a widow , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 10]: Ha , ha , ha , you jade . ''
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 10]: ` Indeed , Quilp , ' returned his wife .
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 13]: ` I 'm very sorry -- ' ` Who doubts it ! '
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 4]: cried the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 5]: ` You very sorry !
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 6]: to be sure you are .
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 10]: Who doubts that you 're VERY sorry ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 34]: I do n't mean sorry that you have come home again alive and well , ' said his wife , ` but sorry that I should have been led into such a belief .
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 14]: I am glad to see you , Quilp ; indeed I am . '
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 41]: In truth Mrs Quilp did seem a great deal more glad to behold her lord than might have been expected , and did evince a degree of interest in his safety which , all things considered , was rather unaccountable .
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 36]: Upon Quilp , however , this circumstance made no impression , farther than as it moved him to snap his fingers close to his wife 's eyes , with divers grins of triumph and derision .
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 28]: ` How could you go away so long , without saying a word to me or letting me hear of you or know anything about you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 8]: asked the poor little woman , sobbing .
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 11]: ` How could you be so cruel , Quilp ? '
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 8]: ` How could I be so cruel !
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 3]: cruel ! '
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 4]: cried the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 8]: ` Because I was in the humour .
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 7]: I 'm in the humour now .
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 8]: I shall be cruel when I like .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 7]: I 'm going away again . '
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 5]: ` Not again ! '
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 5]: ` Yes , again .
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 6]: I 'm going away now .
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 5]: I 'm off directly .
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 26]: I mean to go and live wherever the fancy seizes me -- at the wharf -- at the counting-house -- and be a jolly bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 7]: You were a widow in anticipation .
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 17]: Damme , ' screamed the dwarf , ` I 'll be a bachelor in earnest . '
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 15]: ` You ca n't be serious , Quilp , ' sobbed his wife . '
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 49]: I tell you , ' said the dwarf , exulting in his project , ` that I 'll be a bachelor , a devil-may-care bachelor ; and I 'll have my bachelor 's hall at the counting-house , and at such times come near it if you dare .
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 36]: And mind too that I do n't pounce in upon you at unseasonable hours again , for I 'll be a spy upon you , and come and go like a mole or a weazel .
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 9]: Tom Scott -- where 's Tom Scott ? '
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 22]: ` Here I am , master , ' cried the voice of the boy , as Quilp threw up the window .
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 20]: ` Wait there , you dog , ' returned the dwarf , ` to carry a bachelor 's portmanteau .
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 7]: Pack it up , Mrs Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 13]: Knock up the dear old lady to help ; knock her up .
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 3]: Halloa there !
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 3]: Halloa ! '
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 53]: With these exclamations , Mr Quilp caught up the poker , and hurrying to the door of the good lady 's sleeping-closet , beat upon it therewith until she awoke in inexpressible terror , thinking that her amiable son-in-law surely intended to murder her in justification of the legs she had slandered .
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 48]: Impressed with this idea , she was no sooner fairly awake than she screamed violently , and would have quickly precipitated herself out of the window and through a neighbouring skylight , if her daughter had not hastened in to undeceive her , and implore her assistance .
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 53]: Somewhat reassured by her account of the service she was required to render , Mrs Jiniwin made her appearance in a flannel dressing-gown ; and both mother and daughter , trembling with terror and cold -- for the night was now far advanced -- obeyed Mr Quilp 's directions in submissive silence .
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 94]: Prolonging his preparations as much as possible , for their greater comfort , that eccentric gentleman superintended the packing of his wardrobe , and having added to it with his own hands , a plate , knife and fork , spoon , teacup and saucer , and other small household matters of that nature , strapped up the portmanteau , took it on his shoulders , and actually marched off without another word , and with the case-bottle -LRB- which he had never once put down -RRB- still tightly clasped under his arm .
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 68]: Consigning his heavier burden to the care of Tom Scott when he reached the street , taking a dram from the bottle for his own encouragement , and giving the boy a rap on the head with it as a small taste for himself , Quilp very deliberately led the way to the wharf , and reached it at between three and four o'clock in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 4]: ` Snug ! '
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 27]: said Quilp , when he had groped his way to the wooden counting-house , and opened the door with a key he carried about with him .
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 4]: ` Beautifully snug !
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 9]: Call me at eight , you dog . '
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 45]: With no more formal leave-taking or explanation , he clutched the portmanteau , shut the door on his attendant , and climbing on the desk , and rolling himself up as round as a hedgehog , in an old boat-cloak , fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 99]: Being roused in the morning at the appointed time , and roused with difficulty , after his late fatigues , Quilp instructed Tom Scott to make a fire in the yard of sundry pieces of old timber , and to prepare some coffee for breakfast ; for the better furnishing of which repast he entrusted him with certain small moneys , to be expended in the purchase of hot rolls , butter , sugar , Yarmouth bloaters , and other articles of housekeeping ; so that in a few minutes a savoury meal was smoking on the board .
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 91]: With this substantial comfort , the dwarf regaled himself to his heart 's content ; and being highly satisfied with this free and gipsy mode of life -LRB- which he had often meditated , as offering , whenever he chose to avail himself of it , an agreeable freedom from the restraints of matrimony , and a choice means of keeping Mrs Quilp and her mother in a state of incessant agitation and suspense -RRB- , bestirred himself to improve his retreat , and render it more commodious and comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 37]: With this view , he issued forth to a place hard by , where sea-stores were sold , purchased a second-hand hammock , and had it slung in seamanlike fashion from the ceiling of the counting-house .
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 41]: He also caused to be erected , in the same mouldy cabin , an old ship 's stove with a rusty funnel to carry the smoke through the roof ; and these arrangements completed , surveyed them with ineffable delight .
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 52]: ` I 've got a country-house like Robinson Crusoe , '' said the dwarf , ogling the accommodations ; ' a solitary , sequestered , desolate-island sort of spot , where I can be quite alone when I have business on hand , and be secure from all spies and listeners .
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 16]: Nobody near me here , but rats , and they are fine stealthy secret fellows .
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 12]: I shall be as merry as a grig among these gentry .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 19]: I 'll look out for one like Christopher , and poison him -- ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 29]: Business though -- business -- we must be mindful of business in the midst of pleasure , and the time has flown this morning , I declare . '
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 88]: Enjoining Tom Scott to await his return , and not to stand upon his head , or throw a summerset , or so much as walk upon his hands meanwhile , on pain of lingering torments , the dwarf threw himself into a boat , and crossing to the other side of the river , and then speeding away on foot , reached Mr Swiveller 's usual house of entertainment in Bevis Marks , just as that gentleman sat down alone to dinner in its dusky parlour .
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 34]: ` Dick ' - said the dwarf , thrusting his head in at the door , ` my pet , my pupil , the apple of my eye , hey , hey ! '
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 10]: ` Oh you 're there , are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 10]: returned Mr Swiveller ; ` how are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 6]: ` How 's Dick ? '
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 3]: retorted Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 11]: ` How 's the cream of clerkship , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 13]: ` Why , rather sour , sir , ' replied Mr Swiveller .
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 11]: ` Beginning to border upon cheesiness , in fact . '
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 7]: ` What 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 6]: said the dwarf , advancing .
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 6]: ` Has Sally proved unkind .
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 21]: `` Of all the girls that are so smart , there 's none like -- '' eh , Dick ! '
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 21]: ` Certainly not , ' replied Mr Swiveller , eating his dinner with great gravity , ` none like her .
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 28]: She 's the sphynx of private life , is Sally B. ' ` You 're out of spirits , ' said Quilp , drawing up a chair .
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 7]: ` What 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 13]: ` The law do n't agree with me , ' returned Dick .
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 14]: ` It is n't moist enough , and there 's too much confinement .
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 9]: I have been thinking of running away . '
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 4]: ` Bah ! '
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 4]: said the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 11]: ` Where would you run to , Dick ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 9]: I do n't know ' returned Mr Swiveller .
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 7]: ` Towards Highgate , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 17]: Perhaps the bells might strike up `` Turn again Swiveller , Lord Mayor of London . ''
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 6]: Whittington 's name was Dick .
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 7]: I wish cats were scarcer . ''
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 93]: Quilp looked at his companion with his eyes screwed up into a comical expression of curiosity , and patiently awaited his further explanation ; upon which , however , Mr Swiveller appeared in no hurry to enter , as he ate a very long dinner in profound silence , finally pushed away his plate , threw himself back into his chair , folded his arms , and stared ruefully at the fire , in which some ends of cigars were smoking on their own account , and sending up a fragrant odour .
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 21]: ` Perhaps you 'd like a bit of cake ' -- said Dick , at last turning to the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 8]: ` You 're quite welcome to it .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 13]: You ought to be , for it 's of your making . '
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 3]: said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 46]: Mr Swiveller replied by taking from his pocket a small and very greasy parcel , slowly unfolding it , and displaying a little slab of plum-cake extremely indigestible in appearance , and bordered with a paste of white sugar an inch and a half deep .
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 9]: ` What should you say this was ? '
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 4]: demanded Mr Swiveller .
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 13]: ` It looks like bride-cake , ' replied the dwarf , grinning .
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 10]: ` And whose should you say it was ? '
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 15]: inquired Mr Swiveller , rubbing the pastry against his nose with a dreadful calmness .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 4]: ` Whose ? '
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 15]: ` Not -- ' ` Yes , ' said Dick , ` the same .
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 7]: You need n't mention her name .
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 7]: There 's no such name now .
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 9]: Her name is Cheggs now , Sophy Cheggs .
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 29]: Yet loved I as man never loved that had n't wooden legs , and my heart , my heart is breaking for the love of Sophy Cheggs . '
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 56]: With this extemporary adaptation of a popular ballad to the distressing circumstances of his own case , Mr Swiveller folded up the parcel again , beat it very flat between the palms of his hands , thrust it into his breast , buttoned his coat over it , and folded his arms upon the whole .
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 23]: ` Now , I hope you 're satisfied , sir , ' said Dick ; ` and I hope Fred 's satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 14]: You went partners in the mischief , and I hope you like it .
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 12]: This is the triumph I was to have , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 41]: It 's like the old country-dance of that name , where there are two gentlemen to one lady , and one has her , and the other has n't , but comes limping up behind to make out the figure .
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 12]: But it 's Destiny , and mine 's a crusher . '
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 76]: Disguising his secret joy in Mr Swiveller 's defeat , Daniel Quilp adopted the surest means of soothing him , by ringing the bell , and ordering in a supply of rosy wine -LRB- that is to say , of its usual representative -RRB- , which he put about with great alacrity , calling upon Mr Swiveller to pledge him in various toasts derisive of Cheggs , and eulogistic of the happiness of single men .
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 82]: Such was their impression on Mr Swiveller , coupled with the reflection that no man could oppose his destiny , that in a very short space of time his spirits rose surprisingly , and he was enabled to give the dwarf an account of the receipt of the cake , which , it appeared , had been brought to Bevis Marks by the two surviving Miss Wackleses in person , and delivered at the office door with much giggling and joyfulness .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 4]: ` Ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 3]: said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 10]: ` It will be our turn to giggle soon .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 16]: And that reminds me -- you spoke of young Trent -- where is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 36]: Mr Swiveller explained that his respectable friend had recently accepted a responsible situation in a locomotive gaming-house , and was at that time absent on a professional tour among the adventurous spirits of Great Britain .
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 24]: ` That 's unfortunate , ' said the dwarf , ` for I came , in fact , to ask you about him .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 21]: A thought has occurred to me , Dick ; your friend over the way -- ' ` Which friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 7]: ` In the first floor . '
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 4]: ` Yes ? '
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 15]: ` Your friend in the first floor , Dick , may know him . '
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 16]: ` No , he do n't , ' said Mr Swiveller , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 4]: ` Do n't !
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 70]: No , because he has never seen him , ' rejoined Quilp ; ` but if we were to bring them together , who knows , Dick , but Fred , properly introduced , would serve his turn almost as well as little Nell or her grandfather -- who knows but it might make the young fellow 's fortune , and , through him , yours , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 24]: ` Why , the fact is , you see , ' said Mr Swiveller , ` that they HAVE been brought together . '
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 5]: ` Have been ! '
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 10]: cried the dwarf , looking suspiciously at his companion .
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 6]: ` Through whose means ? '
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 11]: ` Through mine , ' said Dick , slightly confused .
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 17]: ` Did n't I mention it to you the last time you called over yonder ? '
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 13]: ` You know you did n't , ' returned the dwarf . '
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 10]: I believe you 're right , ' said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 7]: I did n't , I recollect .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 11]: Oh yes , I brought 'em together that very day .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 7]: It was Fred 's suggestion . '
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 8]: ` And what came of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 106]: ` Why , instead of my friend 's bursting into tears when he knew who Fred was , embracing him kindly , and telling him that he was his grandfather , or his grandmother in disguise -LRB- which we fully expected -RRB- , he flew into a tremendous passion ; called him all manner of names ; said it was in a great measure his fault that little Nell and the old gentleman had ever been brought to poverty ; did n't hint at our taking anything to drink ; and -- and in short rather turned us out of the room than otherwise . '
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 12]: ` That 's strange , ' said the dwarf , musing .
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 22]: ` So we remarked to each other at the time , ' returned Dick coolly , ` but quite true . '
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 35]: Quilp was plainly staggered by this intelligence , over which he brooded for some time in moody silence , often raising his eyes to Mr Swiveller 's face , and sharply scanning its expression .
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 71]: As he could read in it , however , no additional information or anything to lead him to believe he had spoken falsely ; and as Mr Swiveller , left to his own meditations , sighed deeply , and was evidently growing maudlin on the subject of Mrs Cheggs ; the dwarf soon broke up the conference and took his departure , leaving the bereaved one to his melancholy ruminations .
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 9]: ` Have been brought together , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 10]: said the dwarf as he walked the streets alone .
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 10]: ` My friend has stolen a march upon me .
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 18]: It led him to nothing , and therefore is no great matter , save in the intention .
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 9]: I 'm glad he has lost his mistress .
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 3]: Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 10]: The blockhead must n't leave the law at present .
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 45]: I 'm sure of him where he is , whenever I want him for my own purposes , and , besides , he 's a good unconscious spy on Brass , and tells , in his cups , all that he sees and hears .
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 19]: You 're useful to me , Dick , and cost nothing but a little treating now and then .
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 52]: I am not sure that it may not be worth while , before long , to take credit with the stranger , Dick , by discovering your designs upon the child ; but for the present we 'll remain the best friends in the world , with your good leave . '
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 69]: Pursuing these thoughts , and gasping as he went along , after his own peculiar fashion , Mr Quilp once more crossed the Thames , and shut himself up in his Bachelor 's Hall , which , by reason of its newly-erected chimney depositing the smoke inside the room and carrying none of it off , was not quite so agreeable as more fastidious people might have desired .
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 94]: Such inconveniences , however , instead of disgusting the dwarf with his new abode , rather suited his humour ; so , after dining luxuriously from the public-house , he lighted his pipe , and smoked against the chimney until nothing of him was visible through the mist but a pair of red and highly inflamed eyes , with sometimes a dim vision of his head and face , as , in a violent fit of coughing , he slightly stirred the smoke and scattered the heavy wreaths by which they were obscured .
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 75]: In the midst of this atmosphere , which must infallibly have smothered any other man , Mr Quilp passed the evening with great cheerfulness ; solacing himself all the time with the pipe and the case-bottle ; and occasionally entertaining himself with a melodious howl , intended for a song , but bearing not the faintest resemblance to any scrap of any piece of music , vocal or instrumental , ever invented by man .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 19]: Thus he amused himself until nearly midnight , when he turned into his hammock with the utmost satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 63]: The first sound that met his ears in the morning -- as he half opened his eyes , and , finding himself so unusually near the ceiling , entertained a drowsy idea that he must have been transformed into a fly or blue-bottle in the course of the night , -- was that of a stifled sobbing and weeping in the room .
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 40]: Peeping cautiously over the side of his hammock , he descried Mrs Quilp , to whom , after contemplating her for some time in silence , he communicated a violent start by suddenly yelling out -- ` Halloa ! '
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 6]: ` Oh , Quilp ! '
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 9]: cried his poor little wife , looking up .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 8]: ` How you frightened me ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 12]: I meant to , you jade , ' returned the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 7]: ` What do you want here ?
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 9]: I 'm dead , a n't I ? '
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 45]: ` Oh , please come home , do come home , ' said Mrs Quilp , sobbing ; ` we 'll never do so any more , Quilp , and after all it was only a mistake that grew out of our anxiety . '
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 11]: ` Out of your anxiety , ' grinned the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 15]: ` Yes , I know that -- out of your anxiety for my death .
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 12]: I shall come home when I please , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 14]: I shall come home when I please , and go when I please .
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 41]: I 'll be a Will o ' the Wisp , now here , now there , dancing about you always , starting up when you least expect me , and keeping you in a constant state of restlessness and irritation .
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 5]: Will you begone ? '
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 11]: Mrs Quilp durst only make a gesture of entreaty . '
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 10]: I tell you no , ' cried the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 62]: If you dare to come here again unless you 're sent for , I 'll keep watch-dogs in the yard that 'll growl and bite -- I 'll have man-traps , cunningly altered and improved for catching women -- I 'll have spring guns , that shall explode when you tread upon the wires , and blow you into little pieces .
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 5]: Will you begone ? '
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 5]: ` Do forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 11]: Do come back , ' said his wife , earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 4]: ` No-o-o-o-o ! '
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 3]: roared Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 31]: ` Not till my own good time , and then I 'll return again as often as I choose , and be accountable to nobody for my goings or comings .
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 6]: You see the door there .
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 5]: Will you go ? '
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 59]: Mr Quilp delivered this last command in such a very energetic voice , and moreover accompanied it with such a sudden gesture , indicative of an intention to spring out of his hammock , and , night-capped as he was , bear his wife home again through the public streets , that she sped away like an arrow .
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 56]: Her worthy lord stretched his neck and eyes until she had crossed the yard , and then , not at all sorry to have had this opportunity of carrying his point , and asserting the sanctity of his castle , fell into an immoderate fit of laughter , and laid himself down to sleep again .
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 65]: Chapter 51 The bland and open-hearted proprietor of Bachelor 's Hall slept on amidst the congenial accompaniments of rain , mud , dirt , damp , fog , and rats , until late in the day ; when , summoning his valet Tom Scott to assist him to rise , and to prepare breakfast , he quitted his couch , and made his toilet .
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 17]: This duty performed , and his repast ended , he again betook himself to Bevis Marks .
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 19]: This visit was not intended for Mr Swiveller , but for his friend and employer Mr Sampson Brass .
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 24]: Both gentlemen however were from home , nor was the life and light of law , Miss Sally , at her post either .
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 73]: The fact of their joint desertion of the office was made known to all comers by a scrap of paper in the hand-writing of Mr Swiveller , which was attached to the bell-handle , and which , giving the reader no clue to the time of day when it was first posted , furnished him with the rather vague and unsatisfactory information that that gentleman would ` return in an hour . '
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 19]: ` There 's a servant , I suppose , ' said the dwarf , knocking at the house-door .
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 6]: ` She 'll do . '
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 32]: After a sufficiently long interval , the door was opened , and a small voice immediately accosted him with , ` Oh please will you leave a card or message ? '
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 4]: ` Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 21]: said the dwarf , looking down , -LRB- it was something quite new to him -RRB- upon the small servant .
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 36]: To this , the child , conducting her conversation as upon the occasion of her first interview with Mr Swiveller , again replied , ` Oh please will you leave a card or message ? '
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 32]: ` I 'll write a note , ' said the dwarf , pushing past her into the office ; ` and mind your master has it directly he comes home . '
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 60]: So Mr Quilp climbed up to the top of a tall stool to write the note , and the small servant , carefully tutored for such emergencies , looked on with her eyes wide open , ready , if he so much as abstracted a wafer , to rush into the street and give the alarm to the police .
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 27]: As Mr Quilp folded his note -LRB- which was soon written : being a very short one -RRB- he encountered the gaze of the small servant .
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 9]: He looked at her , long and earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 6]: ` How are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 11]: said the dwarf , moistening a wafer with horrible grimaces .
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 40]: The small servant , perhaps frightened by his looks , returned no audible reply ; but it appeared from the motion of her lips that she was inwardly repeating the same form of expression concerning the note or message .
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 8]: ` Do they use you ill here ?
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 7]: is your mistress a Tartar ? '
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 6]: said Quilp with a chuckle .
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 34]: In reply to the last interrogation , the small servant , with a look of infinite cunning mingled with fear , screwed up her mouth very tight and round , and nodded violently .
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 86]: Whether there was anything in the peculiar slyness of her action which fascinated Mr Quilp , or anything in the expression of her features at the moment which attracted his attention for some other reason ; or whether it merely occurred to him as a pleasant whim to stare the small servant out of countenance ; certain it is , that he planted his elbows square and firmly on the desk , and squeezing up his cheeks with his hands , looked at her fixedly .
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 8]: ` Where do you come from ? '
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 12]: he said after a long pause , stroking his chin . '
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 6]: I do n't know . '
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 7]: ` What 's your name ? '
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 4]: ` Nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 4]: ` Nonsense ! '
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 3]: retorted Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 14]: ` What does your mistress call you when she wants you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 9]: A little devil , ' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 27]: She added in the same breath , as if fearful of any further questioning , ` But please will you leave a card or message ? '
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 11]: These unusual answers might naturally have provoked some more inquiries .
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 58]: Quilp , however , without uttering another word , withdrew his eyes from the small servant , stroked his chin more thoughtfully than before , and then , bending over the note as if to direct it with scrupulous and hair-breadth nicety , looked at her , covertly but very narrowly , from under his bushy eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 34]: The result of this secret survey was , that he shaded his face with his hands , and laughed slyly and noiselessly , until every vein in it was swollen almost to bursting .
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 26]: Pulling his hat over his brow to conceal his mirth and its effects , he tossed the letter to the child , and hastily withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 49]: Once in the street , moved by some secret impulse , he laughed , and held his sides , and laughed again , and tried to peer through the dusty area railings as if to catch another glimpse of the child , until he was quite tired out .
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 62]: At last , he travelled back to the Wilderness , which was within rifle-shot of his bachelor retreat , and ordered tea in the wooden summer-house that afternoon for three persons ; an invitation to Miss Sally Brass and her brother to partake of that entertainment at that place , having been the object both of his journey and his note .
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 41]: It was not precisely the kind of weather in which people usually take tea in summer-houses , far less in summer-houses in an advanced state of decay , and overlooking the slimy banks of a great river at low water .
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 45]: Nevertheless , it was in this choice retreat that Mr Quilp ordered a cold collation to be prepared , and it was beneath its cracked and leaky roof that he , in due course of time , received Mr Sampson and his sister Sally .
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 17]: ` You 're fond of the beauties of nature , ' said Quilp with a grin .
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 7]: ` Is this charming , Brass ?
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 9]: Is it unusual , unsophisticated , primitive ? '
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 13]: ` It 's delightful indeed , sir , ' replied the lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 4]: ` Cool ? '
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 3]: said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 22]: ` N-not particularly so , I think , sir , ' rejoined Brass , with his teeth chattering in his head .
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 9]: ` Perhaps a little damp and ague-ish ? '
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 3]: said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 14]: ` Just damp enough to be cheerful , sir , ' rejoined Brass .
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 10]: ` Nothing more , sir , nothing more . '
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 5]: ` And Sally ? '
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 5]: said the delighted dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 7]: ` Does she like it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 31]: ` She 'll like it better , ' returned that strong-minded lady , ` when she has tea ; so let us have it , and do n't bother . '
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 5]: ` Sweet Sally ! '
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 13]: cried Quilp , extending his arms as if about to embrace her .
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 9]: ` Gentle , charming , overwhelming Sally . '
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 10]: ` He 's a very remarkable man indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 4]: soliloquised Mr Brass .
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 15]: ` He 's quite a Troubadour , you know ; quite a Troubadour ! '
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 62]: These complimentary expressions were uttered in a somewhat absent and distracted manner ; for the unfortunate lawyer , besides having a bad cold in his head , had got wet in coming , and would have willingly borne some pecuniary sacrifice if he could have shifted his present raw quarters to a warm room , and dried himself at a fire .
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 66]: Quilp , however -- who , beyond the gratification of his demon whims , owed Sampson some acknowledgment of the part he had played in the mourning scene of which he had been a hidden witness , marked these symptoms of uneasiness with a delight past all expression , and derived from them a secret joy which the costliest banquet could never have afforded him .
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 86]: It is worthy of remark , too , as illustrating a little feature in the character of Miss Sally Brass , that , although on her own account she would have borne the discomforts of the Wilderness with a very ill grace , and would probably , indeed , have walked off before the tea appeared , she no sooner beheld the latent uneasiness and misery of her brother than she developed a grim satisfaction , and began to enjoy herself after her own manner .
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 31]: Though the wet came stealing through the roof and trickling down upon their heads , Miss Brass uttered no complaint , but presided over the tea equipage with imperturbable composure .
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 187]: While Mr Quilp , in his uproarious hospitality , seated himself upon an empty beer-barrel , vaunted the place as the most beautiful and comfortable in the three kingdoms , and elevating his glass , drank to their next merry-meeting in that jovial spot ; and Mr Brass , with the rain plashing down into his tea-cup , made a dismal attempt to pluck up his spirits and appear at his ease ; and Tom Scott , who was in waiting at the door under an old umbrella , exulted in his agonies , and bade fair to split his sides with laughing ; while all this was passing , Miss Sally Brass , unmindful of the wet which dripped down upon her own feminine person and fair apparel , sat placidly behind the tea-board , erect and grizzly , contemplating the unhappiness of her brother with a mind at ease , and content , in her amiable disregard of self , to sit there all night , witnessing the torments which his avaricious and grovelling nature compelled him to endure and forbade him to resent .
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 49]: And this , it must be observed , or the illustration would be incomplete , although in a business point of view she had the strongest sympathy with Mr Sampson , and would have been beyond measure indignant if he had thwarted their client in any one respect .
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 47]: In the height of his boisterous merriment , Mr Quilp , having on some pretence dismissed his attendant sprite for the moment , resumed his usual manner all at once , dismounted from his cask , and laid his hand upon the lawyer 's sleeve . '
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 14]: A word , ' said the dwarf , ` before we go farther .
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 10]: Sally , hark ` ee for a minute . '
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 23]: Miss Sally drew closer , as if accustomed to business conferences with their host which were the better for not having air .
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 14]: ` Business , ' said the dwarf , glancing from brother to sister .
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 5]: ` Very private business .
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 11]: Lay your heads together when you 're by yourselves . '
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 16]: ` Certainly , sir , ' returned Brass , taking out his pocket-book and pencil .
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 13]: ` I 'll take down the heads if you please , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 20]: Remarkable documents , ' added the lawyer , raising his eyes to the ceiling , ` most remarkable documents .
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 15]: He states his points so clearly that it 's a treat to have 'em !
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 18]: I do n't know any act of parliament that 's equal to him in clearness . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 12]: I shall deprive you of a treat , ' said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 6]: ` Put up your book .
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 7]: We do n't want any documents .
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 2]: So .
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 19]: There 's a lad named Kit -- ' Miss Sally nodded , implying that she knew of him .
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 4]: ` Kit ! '
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 4]: said Mr Sampson .
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 4]: -- ` Kit !
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 48]: I 've heard the name before , but I do n't exactly call to mind -- I do n't exactly -- ' ` You 're as slow as a tortoise , and more thick-headed than a rhinoceros , ' returned his obliging client with an impatient gesture .
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 7]: ` He 's extremely pleasant ! '
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 5]: cried the obsequious Sampson .
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 10]: ` His acquaintance with Natural History too is surprising .
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 7]: Quite a Buffoon , quite ! '
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 37]: There is no doubt that Mr Brass intended some compliment or other ; and it has been argued with show of reason that he would have said Buffon , but made use of a superfluous vowel .
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 35]: Be this as it may , Quilp gave him no time for correction , as he performed that office himself by more than tapping him on the head with the handle of his umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 18]: ` Do n't let 's have any wrangling , ' said Miss Sally , staying his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 16]: ` I 've showed you that I know him , and that 's enough . '
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 7]: ` She 's always foremost ! '
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 16]: said the dwarf , patting her on the back and looking contemptuously at Sampson . '
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 9]: I do n't like Kit , Sally . '
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 9]: ` Nor I , ' rejoined Miss Brass .
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 8]: ` Nor I , ' said Sampson .
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 8]: ` Why , that 's right ! '
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 3]: cried Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 8]: ` Half our work is done already .
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 52]: This Kit is one of your honest people ; one of your fair characters ; a prowling prying hound ; a hypocrite ; a double-faced , white-livered , sneaking spy ; a crouching cur to those that feed and coax him , and a barking yelping dog to all besides . '
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 5]: ` Fearfully eloquent ! '
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 6]: cried Brass with a sneeze .
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 5]: ` Quite appalling ! '
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 20]: ` Come to the point , ' said Miss Sally , ` and do n't talk so much . '
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 5]: ` Right again ! '
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 14]: exclaimed Quilp , with another contemptuous look at Sampson , ` always foremost !
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 24]: I say , Sally , he is a yelping , insolent dog to all besides , and most of all , to me .
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 10]: In short , I owe him a grudge . '
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 11]: ` That 's enough , sir , ' said Sampson .
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 21]: ` No , it 's not enough , sir , ' sneered Quilp ; ` will you hear me out ?
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 36]: Besides that I owe him a grudge on that account , he thwarts me at this minute , and stands between me and an end which might otherwise prove a golden one to us all .
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 17]: Apart from that , I repeat that he crosses my humour , and I hate him .
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 13]: Now , you know the lad , and can guess the rest .
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 16]: Devise your own means of putting him out of my way , and execute them .
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 6]: Shall it be done ? '
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 10]: ` It shall , sir , ' said Sampson .
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 11]: ` Then give me your hand , ' retorted Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 7]: ` Sally , girl , yours .
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 13]: I rely as much , or more , on you than him .
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 5]: Tom Scott comes back .
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 15]: Lantern , pipes , more grog , and a jolly night of it ! '
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 26]: No other word was spoken , no other look exchanged , which had the slightest reference to this , the real occasion of their meeting .
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 29]: The trio were well accustomed to act together , and were linked to each other by ties of mutual interest and advantage , and nothing more was needed .
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 36]: Resuming his boisterous manner with the same ease with which he had thrown it off , Quilp was in an instant the same uproarious , reckless little savage he had been a few seconds before .
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 55]: It was ten o'clock at night before the amiable Sally supported her beloved and loving brother from the Wilderness , by which time he needed the utmost support her tender frame could render ; his walk being from some unknown reason anything but steady , and his legs constantly doubling up in unexpected places .
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 37]: Overpowered , notwithstanding his late prolonged slumbers , by the fatigues of the last few days , the dwarf lost no time in creeping to his dainty house , and was soon dreaming in his hammock .
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 37]: Leaving him to visions , in which perhaps the quiet figures we quitted in the old church porch were not without their share , be it our task to rejoin them as they sat and watched .
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 38]: Chapter 52 After a long time , the schoolmaster appeared at the wicket-gate of the churchyard , and hurried towards them , Tingling in his hand , as he came along , a bundle of rusty keys .
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 33]: He was quite breathless with pleasure and haste when he reached the porch , and at first could only point towards the old building which the child had been contemplating so earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 14]: ` You see those two old houses , ' he said at last .
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 10]: ` Yes , surely , ' replied Nell . '
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 16]: I have been looking at them nearly all the time you have been away . '
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 29]: ` And you would have looked at them more curiously yet , if you could have guessed what I have to tell you , ' said her friend .
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 9]: ` One of those houses is mine . '
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 39]: Without saying any more , or giving the child time to reply , the schoolmaster took her hand , and , his honest face quite radiant with exultation , led her to the place of which he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 8]: They stopped before its low arched door .
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 32]: After trying several of the keys in vain , the schoolmaster found one to fit the huge lock , which turned back , creaking , and admitted them into the house .
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 38]: The room into which they entered was a vaulted chamber once nobly ornamented by cunning architects , and still retaining , in its beautiful groined roof and rich stone tracery , choice remnants of its ancient splendour .
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 36]: Foliage carved in the stone , and emulating the mastery of Nature 's hand , yet remained to tell how many times the leaves outside had come and gone , while it lived on unchanged .
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 53]: The broken figures supporting the burden of the chimney-piece , though mutilated , were still distinguishable for what they had been -- far different from the dust without -- and showed sadly by the empty hearth , like creatures who had outlived their kind , and mourned their own too slow decay .
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 57]: In some old time -- for even change was old in that old place -- a wooden partition had been constructed in one part of the chamber to form a sleeping-closet , into which the light was admitted at the same period by a rude window , or rather niche , cut in the solid wall .
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 62]: This screen , together with two seats in the broad chimney , had at some forgotten date been part of the church or convent ; for the oak , hastily appropriated to its present purpose , had been little altered from its former shape , and presented to the eye a pile of fragments of rich carving from old monkish stalls .
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 32]: An open door leading to a small room or cell , dim with the light that came through leaves of ivy , completed the interior of this portion of the ruin .
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 8]: It was not quite destitute of furniture .
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 76]: A few strange chairs , whose arms and legs looked as though they had dwindled away with age ; a table , the very spectre of its race : a great old chest that had once held records in the church , with other quaintly-fashioned domestic necessaries , and store of fire-wood for the winter , were scattered around , and gave evident tokens of its occupation as a dwelling-place at no very distant time .
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 32]: The child looked around her , with that solemn feeling with which we contemplate the work of ages that have become but drops of water in the great ocean of eternity .
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 38]: The old man had followed them , but they were all three hushed for a space , and drew their breath softly , as if they feared to break the silence even by so slight a sound .
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 9]: ` It is a very beautiful place ! '
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 10]: said the child , in a low voice . '
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 12]: I almost feared you thought otherwise , ' returned the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 19]: ` You shivered when we first came in , as if you felt it cold or gloomy . '
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 17]: ` It was not that , ' said Nell , glancing round with a slight shudder .
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 30]: ` Indeed I can not tell you what it was , but when I saw the outside , from the church porch , the same feeling came over me .
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 12]: It is its being so old and grey perhaps . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 18]: A peaceful place to live in , do n't you think so -RRB- ' said her friend .
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 15]: ` Oh yes , ' rejoined the child , clasping her hands earnestly . '
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 17]: A quiet , happy place -- a place to live and learn to die in ! '
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 29]: She would have said more , but that the energy of her thoughts caused her voice to falter , and come in trembling whispers from her lips . '
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 33]: A place to live , and learn to live , and gather health of mind and body in , ' said the schoolmaster ; ` for this old house is yours . '
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 4]: ` Ours ! '
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 4]: cried the child .
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 21]: ` Ay , ' returned the schoolmaster gaily , ` for many a merry year to come , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 18]: I shall be a close neighbour -- only next door -- but this house is yours . '
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 154]: Having now disburdened himself of his great surprise , the schoolmaster sat down , and drawing Nell to his side , told her how he had learnt that ancient tenement had been occupied for a very long time by an old person , nearly a hundred years of age , who kept the keys of the church , opened and closed it for the services , and showed it to strangers ; how she had died not many weeks ago , and nobody had yet been found to fill the office ; how , learning all this in an interview with the sexton , who was confined to his bed by rheumatism , he had been bold to make mention of his fellow-traveller , which had been so favourably received by that high authority , that he had taken courage , acting on his advice , to propound the matter to the clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 53]: In a word , the result of his exertions was , that Nell and her grandfather were to be carried before the last-named gentleman next day ; and , his approval of their conduct and appearance reserved as a matter of form , that they were already appointed to the vacant post .
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 14]: ` There 's a small allowance of money , ' said the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 17]: ` It is not much , but still enough to live upon in this retired spot .
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 17]: By clubbing our funds together , we shall do bravely ; no fear of that . '
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 8]: ` Heaven bless and prosper you ! '
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 4]: sobbed the child .
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 37]: ` Amen , my dear , ' returned her friend cheerfully ; ` and all of us , as it will , and has , in leading us through sorrow and trouble to this tranquil life .
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 9]: But we must look at MY house now .
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 3]: Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 27]: They repaired to the other tenement ; tried the rusty keys as before ; at length found the right one ; and opened the worm-eaten door .
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 32]: It led into a chamber , vaulted and old , like that from which they had come , but not so spacious , and having only one other little room attached .
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 36]: It was not difficult to divine that the other house was of right the schoolmaster 's , and that he had chosen for himself the least commodious , in his care and regard for them .
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 24]: Like the adjoining habitation , it held such old articles of furniture as were absolutely necessary , and had its stack of fire-wood .
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 20]: To make these dwellings as habitable and full of comfort as they could , was now their pleasant care .
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 30]: In a short time , each had its cheerful fire glowing and crackling on the hearth , and reddening the pale old wall with a hale and healthy blush .
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 34]: Nell , busily plying her needle , repaired the tattered window-hangings , drew together the rents that time had worn in the threadbare scraps of carpet , and made them whole and decent .
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 43]: The schoolmaster swept and smoothed the ground before the door , trimmed the long grass , trained the ivy and creeping plants which hung their drooping heads in melancholy neglect ; and gave to the outer walls a cheery air of home .
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 33]: The old man , sometimes by his side and sometimes with the child , lent his aid to both , went here and there on little patient services , and was happy .
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 30]: Neighbours , too , as they came from work , proffered their help ; or sent their children with such small presents or loans as the strangers needed most .
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 33]: It was a busy day ; and night came on , and found them wondering that there was yet so much to do , and that it should be dark so soon .
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 53]: They took their supper together , in the house which may be henceforth called the child 's ; and , when they had finished their meal , drew round the fire , and almost in whispers -- their hearts were too quiet and glad for loud expression -- discussed their future plans .
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 26]: Before they separated , the schoolmaster read some prayers aloud ; and then , full of gratitude and happiness , they parted for the night .
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 48]: At that silent hour , when her grandfather was sleeping peacefully in his bed , and every sound was hushed , the child lingered before the dying embers , and thought of her past fortunes as if they had been a dream And she only now awoke .
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 91]: The glare of the sinking flame , reflected in the oaken panels whose carved tops were dimly seen in the dusky roof -- the aged walls , where strange shadows came and went with every flickering of the fire -- the solemn presence , within , of that decay which falls on senseless things the most enduring in their nature : and , without , and round about on every side , of Death -- filled her with deep and thoughtful feelings , but with none of terror or alarm .
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 18]: A change had been gradually stealing over her , in the time of her loneliness and sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 40]: With failing strength and heightening resolution , there had sprung up a purified and altered mind ; there had grown in her bosom blessed thoughts and hopes , which are the portion of few but the weak and drooping .
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 41]: There were none to see the frail , perishable figure , as it glided from the fire and leaned pensively at the open casement ; none but the stars , to look into the upturned face and read its history .
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 52]: The old church bell rang out the hour with a mournful sound , as if it had grown sad from so much communing with the dead and unheeded warning to the living ; the fallen leaves rustled ; the grass stirred upon the graves ; all else was still and sleeping .
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 29]: Some of those dreamless sleepers lay close within the shadow of the church -- touching the wall , as if they clung to it for comfort and protection .
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 33]: Others had chosen to lie beneath the changing shade of trees ; others by the path , that footsteps might come near them ; others , among the graves of little children .
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 42]: Some had desired to rest beneath the very ground they had trodden in their daily walks ; some , where the setting sun might shine upon their beds ; some , where its light would fall upon them when it rose .
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 22]: Perhaps not one of the imprisoned souls had been able quite to separate itself in living thought from its old companion .
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 45]: If any had , it had still felt for it a love like that which captives have been known to bear towards the cell in which they have been long confined , and , even at parting , hung upon its narrow bounds affectionately .
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 15]: It was long before the child closed the window , and approached her bed .
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 30]: Again something of the same sensation as before -- an involuntary chill -- a momentary feeling akin to fear -- but vanishing directly , and leaving no alarm behind .
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 48]: Again , too , dreams of the little scholar ; of the roof opening , and a column of bright faces , rising far away into the sky , as she had seen in some old scriptural picture once , and looking down on her , asleep .
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 8]: It was a sweet and happy dream .
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 29]: The quiet spot , outside , seemed to remain the same , saving that there was music in the air , and a sound of angels ' wings .
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 18]: After a time the sisters came there , hand in hand , and stood among the graves .
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 10]: And then the dream grew dim , and faded .
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 34]: With the brightness and joy of morning , came the renewal of yesterday 's labours , the revival of its pleasant thoughts , the restoration of its energies , cheerfulness , and hope .
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 20]: They worked gaily in ordering and arranging their houses until noon , and then went to visit the clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 41]: He was a simple-hearted old gentleman , of a shrinking , subdued spirit , accustomed to retirement , and very little acquainted with the world , which he had left many years before to come and settle in that place .
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 29]: His wife had died in the house in which he still lived , and he had long since lost sight of any earthly cares or hopes beyond it .
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 37]: He received them very kindly , and at once showed an interest in Nell ; asking her name , and age , her birthplace , the circumstances which had led her there , and so forth .
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 8]: The schoolmaster had already told her story .
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 21]: They had no other friends or home to leave , he said , and had come to share his fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 11]: He loved the child as though she were his own .
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 10]: ` Well , well , ' said the clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 8]: ` Let it be as you desire .
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 6]: She is very young . '
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 14]: ` Old in adversity and trial , sir , ' replied the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 5]: ` God help her .
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 14]: Let her rest , and forget them , ' said the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 22]: ` But an old church is a dull and gloomy place for one so young as you , my child . '
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 11]: ` Oh no , sir , ' returned Nell . '
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 10]: I have no such thoughts , indeed . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 42]: I would rather see her dancing on the green at nights , ' said the old gentleman , laying his hand upon her head , and smiling sadly , ` than have her sitting in the shadow of our mouldering arches .
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 20]: You must look to this , and see that her heart does not grow heavy among these solemn ruins .
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 8]: Your request is granted , friend . '
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 32]: After more kind words , they withdrew , and repaired to the child 's house ; where they were yet in conversation on their happy fortune , when another friend appeared .
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 41]: This was a little old gentleman , who lived in the parsonage-house , and had resided there -LRB- so they learnt soon afterwards -RRB- ever since the death of the clergyman 's wife , which had happened fifteen years before .
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 38]: He had been his college friend and always his close companion ; in the first shock of his grief he had come to console and comfort him ; and from that time they had never parted company .
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 51]: The little old gentleman was the active spirit of the place , the adjuster of all differences , the promoter of all merry-makings , the dispenser of his friend 's bounty , and of no small charity of his own besides ; the universal mediator , comforter , and friend .
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 26]: None of the simple villagers had cared to ask his name , or , when they knew it , to store it in their memory .
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 36]: Perhaps from some vague rumour of his college honours which had been whispered abroad on his first arrival , perhaps because he was an unmarried , unencumbered gentleman , he had been called the bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 23]: The name pleased him , or suited him as well as any other , and the Bachelor he had ever since remained .
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 33]: And the bachelor it was , it may be added , who with his own hands had laid in the stock of fuel which the wanderers had found in their new habitation .
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 44]: The bachelor , then -- to call him by his usual appellation -- lifted the latch , showed his little round mild face for a moment at the door , and stepped into the room like one who was no stranger to it .
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 11]: ` You are Mr Marton , the new schoolmaster ? '
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 10]: he said , greeting Nell 's kind friend . '
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 6]: I am , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 14]: ` You come well recommended , and I am glad to see you .
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 42]: I should have been in the way yesterday , expecting you , but I rode across the country to carry a message from a sick mother to her daughter in service some miles off , and have but just now returned .
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 6]: This is our young church-keeper ?
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 30]: You are not the less welcome , friend , for her sake , or for this old man 's ; nor the worse teacher for having learnt humanity . '
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 34]: ` She has been ill , sir , very lately , ' said the schoolmaster , in answer to the look with which their visitor regarded Nell when he had kissed her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 5]: ` Yes , yes .
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 9]: I know she has , ' he rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 10]: ` There have been suffering and heartache here . '
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 8]: ` Indeed there have , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 27]: The little old gentleman glanced at the grandfather , and back again at the child , whose hand he took tenderly in his , and held .
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 24]: ` You will be happier here , ' he said ; ` we will try , at least , to make you so .
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 8]: You have made great improvements here already .
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 9]: Are they the work of your hands ? '
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 6]: ` Yes , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 23]: ` We may make some others -- not better in themselves , but with better means perhaps , ' said the bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 11]: ` Let us see now , let us see . '
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 63]: Nell accompanied him into the other little rooms , and over both the houses , in which he found various small comforts wanting , which he engaged to supply from a certain collection of odds and ends he had at home , and which must have been a very miscellaneous and extensive one , as it comprehended the most opposite articles imaginable .
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 54]: They all came , however , and came without loss of time ; for the little old gentleman , disappearing for some five or ten minutes , presently returned , laden with old shelves , rugs , blankets , and other household gear , and followed by a boy bearing a similar load .
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 50]: These being cast on the floor in a promiscuous heap , yielded a quantity of occupation in arranging , erecting , and putting away ; the superintendence of which task evidently afforded the old gentleman extreme delight , and engaged him for some time with great briskness and activity .
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 32]: When nothing more was left to be done , he charged the boy to run off and bring his schoolmates to be marshalled before their new master , and solemnly reviewed .
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 43]: ` As good a set of fellows , Marton , as you 'd wish to see , ' he said , turning to the schoolmaster when the boy was gone ; ` but I do n't let 'em know I think so .
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 9]: That would n't do , at all . '
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 83]: The messenger soon returned at the head of a long row of urchins , great and small , who , being confronted by the bachelor at the house door , fell into various convulsions of politeness ; clutching their hats and caps , squeezing them into the smallest possible dimensions , and making all manner of bows and scrapes , which the little old gentleman contemplated with excessive satisfaction , and expressed his approval of by a great many nods and smiles .
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 44]: Indeed , his approbation of the boys was by no means so scrupulously disguised as he had led the schoolmaster to suppose , inasmuch as it broke out in sundry loud whispers and confidential remarks which were perfectly audible to them every one .
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 43]: ` This first boy , schoolmaster , ' said the bachelor , ` is John Owen ; a lad of good parts , sir , and frank , honest temper ; but too thoughtless , too playful , too light-headed by far .
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 63]: That boy , my good sir , would break his neck with pleasure , and deprive his parents of their chief comfort -- and between ourselves , when you come to see him at hare and hounds , taking the fence and ditch by the finger-post , and sliding down the face of the little quarry , you 'll never forget it .
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 5]: It 's beautiful ! '
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 24]: John Owen having been thus rebuked , and being in perfect possession of the speech aside , the bachelor singled out another boy .
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 15]: ` Now , look at that lad , sir , ' said the bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 6]: ` You see that fellow ?
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 8]: Richard Evans his name is , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 37]: An amazing boy to learn , blessed with a good memory , and a ready understanding , and moreover with a good voice and ear for psalm-singing , in which he is the best among us .
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 67]: Yet , sir , that boy will come to a bad end ; he 'll never die in his bed ; he 's always falling asleep in sermon-time -- and to tell you the truth , Mr Marton , I always did the same at his age , and feel quite certain that it was natural to my constitution and I could n't help it . '
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 16]: This hopeful pupil edified by the above terrible reproval , the bachelor turned to another .
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 48]: ` But if we talk of examples to be shunned , ' said he , ` if we come to boys that should be a warning and a beacon to all their fellows , here 's the one , and I hope you wo n't spare him .
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 17]: This is the lad , sir ; this one with the blue eyes and light hair .
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 17]: This is a swimmer , sir , this fellow -- a diver , Lord save us !
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 66]: This is a boy , sir , who had a fancy for plunging into eighteen feet of water , with his clothes on , and bringing up a blind man 's dog , who was being drowned by the weight of his chain and collar , while his master stood wringing his hands upon the bank , bewailing the loss of his guide and friend .
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 49]: I sent the boy two guineas anonymously , sir , ' added the bachelor , in his peculiar whisper , ` directly I heard of it ; but never mention it on any account , for he has n't the least idea that it came from me . '
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 62]: Having disposed of this culprit , the bachelor turned to another , and from him to another , and so on through the whole array , laying , for their wholesome restriction within due bounds , the same cutting emphasis on such of their propensities as were dearest to his heart and were unquestionably referrable to his own precept and example .
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 80]: Thoroughly persuaded , in the end , that he had made them miserable by his severity , he dismissed them with a small present , and an admonition to walk quietly home , without any leapings , scufflings , or turnings out of the way ; which injunction , he informed the schoolmaster in the same audible confidence , he did not think he could have obeyed when he was a boy , had his life depended on it .
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 46]: Hailing these little tokens of the bachelor 's disposition as so many assurances of his own welcome course from that time , the schoolmaster parted from him with a light heart and joyous spirits , and deemed himself one of the happiest men on earth .
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 63]: The windows of the two old houses were ruddy again , that night , with the reflection of the cheerful fires that burnt within ; and the bachelor and his friend , pausing to look upon them as they returned from their evening walk , spoke softly together of the beautiful child , and looked round upon the churchyard with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 81]: Chapter 53 Nell was stirring early in the morning , and having discharged her household tasks , and put everything in order for the good schoolmaster -LRB- though sorely against his will , for he would have spared her the pains -RRB- , took down , from its nail by the fireside , a little bundle of keys with which the bachelor had formally invested her on the previous day , and went out alone to visit the old church .
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 27]: The sky was serene and bright , the air clear , perfumed with the fresh scent of newly fallen leaves , and grateful to every sense .
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 31]: The neighbouring stream sparkled , and rolled onward with a tuneful sound ; the dew glistened on the green mounds , like tears shed by Good Spirits over the dead .
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 18]: Some young children sported among the tombs , and hid from each other , with laughing faces .
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 26]: They had an infant with them , and had laid it down asleep upon a child 's grave , in a little bed of leaves .
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 43]: It was a new grave -- the resting-place , perhaps , of some little creature , who , meek and patient in its illness , had often sat and watched them , and now seemed , to their minds , scarcely changed .
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 13]: She drew near and asked one of them whose grave it was .
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 19]: The child answered that that was not its name ; it was a garden -- his brother 's .
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 28]: It was greener , he said , than all the other gardens , and the birds loved it better because he had been used to feed them .
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 33]: When he had done speaking , he looked at her with a smile , and kneeling down and nestling for a moment with his cheek against the turf , bounded merrily away .
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 24]: She passed the church , gazing upward at its old tower , went through the wicket gate , and so into the village .
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 24]: The old sexton , leaning on a crutch , was taking the air at his cottage door , and gave her good morrow .
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 6]: ` You are better ? '
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 10]: said the child , stopping to speak with him .
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 10]: ` Ay surely , ' returned the old man .
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 11]: ` I 'm thankful to say , much better . '
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 9]: ` YOU will be quite well soon . '
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 11]: ` With Heaven 's leave , and a little patience .
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 8]: But come in , come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 32]: The old man limped on before , and warning her of the downward step , which he achieved himself with no small difficulty , led the way into his little cottage .
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 9]: ` It is but one room you see .
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 25]: There is another up above , but the stair has got harder to climb o ' late years , and I never use it .
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 15]: I 'm thinking of taking to it again , next summer , though . '
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 23]: The child wondered how a grey-headed man like him -- one of his trade too -- could talk of time so easily .
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 18]: He saw her eyes wandering to the tools that hung upon the wall , and smiled . '
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 21]: I warrant now , ' he said , ` that you think all those are used in making graves . '
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 12]: ` Indeed , I wondered that you wanted so many . '
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 6]: ` And well you might .
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 5]: I am a gardener .
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 15]: I dig the ground , and plant things that are to live and grow .
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 14]: My works do n't all moulder away , and rot in the earth .
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 9]: You see that spade in the centre ? '
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 11]: ` The very old one -- so notched and worn ?
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 3]: Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 19]: ` That 's the sexton 's spade , and it 's a well-used one , as you see .
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 15]: We 're healthy people here , but it has done a power of work .
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 39]: If it could speak now , that spade , it would tell you of many an unexpected job that it and I have done together ; but I forget 'em , for my memory 's a poor one .
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 11]: -- That 's nothing new , ' he added hastily .
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 6]: ` It always was . '
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 18]: ` There are flowers and shrubs to speak to your other work , ' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 4]: ` Oh yes .
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 4]: And tall trees .
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 16]: But they are not so separate from the sexton 's labours as you think . '
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 20]: ` Not in my mind , and recollection -- such as it is , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 7]: ` Indeed they often help it .
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 13]: For say that I planted such a tree for such a man .
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 11]: There it stands , to remind me that he died .
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 42]: When I look at its broad shadow , and remember what it was in his time , it helps me to the age of my other work , and I can tell you pretty nearly when I made his grave . '
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 18]: ` But it may remind you of one who is still alive , ' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 43]: ` Of twenty that are dead , in connexion with that one who lives , then , ' rejoined the old man ; ` wife , husband , parents , brothers , sisters , children , friends -- a score at least .
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 13]: So it happens that the sexton 's spade gets worn and battered .
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 11]: I shall need a new one -- next summer . '
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 26]: The child looked quickly towards him , thinking that he jested with his age and infirmity : but the unconscious sexton was quite in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 8]: he said , after a brief silence .
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 5]: ` People never learn .
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 4]: They never learn .
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 34]: It 's only we who turn up the ground , where nothing grows and everything decays , who think of such things as these -- who think of them properly , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 9]: You have been into the church ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 11]: I am going there now , ' the child replied .
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 27]: ` There 's an old well there , ' said the sexton , ` right underneath the belfry ; a deep , dark , echoing well .
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 36]: Forty year ago , you had only to let down the bucket till the first knot in the rope was free of the windlass , and you heard it splashing in the cold dull water .
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 42]: By little and little the water fell away , so that in ten year after that , a second knot was made , and you must unwind so much rope , or the bucket swung tight and empty at the end .
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 18]: In ten years ' time , the water fell again , and a third knot was made .
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 82]: In ten years more , the well dried up ; and now , if you lower the bucket till your arms are tired , and let out nearly all the cord , you 'll hear it , of a sudden , clanking and rattling on the ground below ; with a sound of being so deep and so far down , that your heart leaps into your mouth , and you start away as if you were falling in . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 11]: A dreadful place to come on in the dark ! '
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 23]: exclaimed the child , who had followed the old man 's looks and words until she seemed to stand upon its brink .
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 9]: ` What is it but a grave ! '
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 4]: said the sexton .
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 4]: ` What else !
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 28]: And which of our old folks , knowing all this , thought , as the spring subsided , of their own failing strength , and lessening life ?
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 4]: Not one ! '
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 8]: ` Are you very old yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 7]: asked the child , involuntarily . '
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 9]: I shall be seventy-nine -- next summer . '
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 10]: ` You still work when you are well ? '
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 3]: ` Work !
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 4]: To be sure .
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 7]: You shall see my gardens hereabout .
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 6]: Look at the window there .
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 17]: I made , and have kept , that plot of ground entirely with my own hands .
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 20]: By this time next year I shall hardly see the sky , the boughs will have grown so thick .
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 10]: I have my winter work at night besides . '
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 32]: He opened , as he spoke , a cupboard close to where he sat , and produced some miniature boxes , carved in a homely manner and made of old wood .
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 32]: ` Some gentlefolks who are fond of ancient days , and what belongs to them , ' he said , ` like to buy these keepsakes from our church and ruins .
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 29]: Sometimes , I make them of scraps of oak , that turn up here and there ; sometimes of bits of coffins which the vaults have long preserved .
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 39]: See here -- this is a little chest of the last kind , clasped at the edges with fragments of brass plates that had writing on 'em once , though it would be hard to read it now .
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 23]: I have n't many by me at this time of year , but these shelves will be full -- next summer . '
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 73]: The child admired and praised his work , and shortly afterwards departed ; thinking , as she went , how strange it was , that this old man , drawing from his pursuits , and everything around him , one stern moral , never contemplated its application to himself ; and , while he dwelt upon the uncertainty of human life , seemed both in word and deed to deem himself immortal .
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 49]: But her musings did not stop here , for she was wise enough to think that by a good and merciful adjustment this must be human nature , and that the old sexton , with his plans for next summer , was but a type of all mankind .
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 10]: Full of these meditations , she reached the church .
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 24]: It was easy to find the key belonging to the outer door , for each was labelled on a scrap of yellow parchment .
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 32]: Its very turning in the lock awoke a hollow sound , and when she entered with a faltering step , the echoes that it raised in closing , made her start .
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 107]: If the peace of the simple village had moved the child more strongly , because of the dark and troubled ways that lay beyond , and through which she had journeyed with such failing feet , what was the deep impression of finding herself alone in that solemn building , where the very light , coming through sunken windows , seemed old and grey , and the air , redolent of earth and mould , seemed laden with decay , purified by time of all its grosser particles , and sighing through arch and aisle , and clustered pillars , like the breath of ages gone !
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 38]: Here was the broken pavement , worn , so long ago , by pious feet , that Time , stealing on the pilgrims ' steps , had trodden out their track , and left but crumbling stones .
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 50]: Here were the rotten beam , the sinking arch , the sapped and mouldering wall , the lowly trench of earth , the stately tomb on which no epitaph remained -- all -- marble , stone , iron , wood , and dust -- one common monument of ruin .
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 42]: The best work and the worst , the plainest and the richest , the stateliest and the least imposing -- both of Heaven 's work and Man 's -- all found one common level here , and told one common tale .
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 52]: Some part of the edifice had been a baronial chapel , and here were effigies of warriors stretched upon their beds of stone with folded hands -- cross-legged , those who had fought in the Holy Wars -- girded with their swords , and cased in armour as they had lived .
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 28]: Some of these knights had their own weapons , helmets , coats of mail , hanging upon the walls hard by , and dangling from rusty hooks .
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 21]: Broken and dilapidated as they were , they yet retained their ancient form , and something of their ancient aspect .
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 35]: Thus violent deeds live after men upon the earth , and traces of war and bloodshed will survive in mournful shapes long after those who worked the desolation are but atoms of earth themselves .
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 60]: The child sat down , in this old , silent place , among the stark figures on the tombs -- they made it more quiet there , than elsewhere , to her fancy -- and gazing round with a feeling of awe , tempered with a calm delight , felt that now she was happy , and at rest .
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 99]: She took a Bible from the shelf , and read ; then , laying it down , thought of the summer days and the bright springtime that would come -- of the rays of sun that would fall in aslant , upon the sleeping forms -- of the leaves that would flutter at the window , and play in glistening shadows on the pavement -- of the songs of birds , and growth of buds and blossoms out of doors -- of the sweet air , that would steal in , and gently wave the tattered banners overhead .
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 9]: What if the spot awakened thoughts of death !
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 25]: Die who would , it would still remain the same ; these sights and sounds would still go on , as happily as ever .
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 10]: It would be no pain to sleep amidst them .
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 67]: She left the chapel -- very slowly and often turning back to gaze again -- and coming to a low door , which plainly led into the tower , opened it , and climbed the winding stair in darkness ; save where she looked down , through narrow loopholes , on the place she had left , or caught a glimmering vision of the dusty bells .
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 16]: At length she gained the end of the ascent and stood upon the turret top .
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 75]: the glory of the sudden burst of light ; the freshness of the fields and woods , stretching away on every side , and meeting the bright blue sky ; the cattle grazing in the pasturage ; the smoke , that , coming from among the trees , seemed to rise upward from the green earth ; the children yet at their gambols down below -- all , everything , so beautiful and happy !
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 15]: It was like passing from death to life ; it was drawing nearer Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 17]: The children were gone , when she emerged into the porch , and locked the door .
Parsing [sent. 7017 len. 14]: As she passed the school-house she could hear the busy hum of voices .
Parsing [sent. 7018 len. 11]: Her friend had begun his labours only on that day .
Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 26]: The noise grew louder , and , looking back , she saw the boys come trooping out and disperse themselves with merry shouts and play .
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 23]: ` It 's a good thing , ' thought the child , ' I am very glad they pass the church . '
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 27]: And then she stopped , to fancy how the noise would sound inside , and how gently it would seem to die away upon the ear .
Parsing [sent. 7022 len. 37]: Again that day , yes , twice again , she stole back to the old chapel , and in her former seat read from the same book , or indulged the same quiet train of thought .
Parsing [sent. 7023 len. 39]: Even when it had grown dusk , and the shadows of coming night made it more solemn still , the child remained , like one rooted to the spot , and had no fear or thought of stirring .
Parsing [sent. 7024 len. 13]: They found her there , at last , and took her home .
Parsing [sent. 7025 len. 38]: She looked pale but very happy , until they separated for the night ; and then , as the poor schoolmaster stooped down to kiss her cheek , he thought he felt a tear upon his face .
Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 23]: Chapter 54 The bachelor , among his various occupations , found in the old church a constant source of interest and amusement .
Parsing [sent. 7027 len. 65]: Taking that pride in it which men conceive for the wonders of their own little world , he had made its history his study ; and many a summer day within its walls , and many a winter 's night beside the parsonage fire , had found the bachelor still poring over , and adding to , his goodly store of tale and legend .
Parsing [sent. 7028 len. 161]: As he was not one of those rough spirits who would strip fair Truth of every little shadowy vestment in which time and teeming fancies love to array her -- and some of which become her pleasantly enough , serving , like the waters of her well , to add new graces to the charms they half conceal and half suggest , and to awaken interest and pursuit rather than languor and indifference -- as , unlike this stern and obdurate class , he loved to see the goddess crowned with those garlands of wild flowers which tradition wreathes for her gentle wearing , and which are often freshest in their homeliest shapes -- he trod with a light step and bore with a light hand upon the dust of centuries , unwilling to demolish any of the airy shrines that had been raised above it , if any good feeling or affection of the human heart were hiding thereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 7029 len. 151]: Thus , in the case of an ancient coffin of rough stone , supposed , for many generations , to contain the bones of a certain baron , who , after ravaging , with cut , and thrust , and plunder , in foreign lands , came back with a penitent and sorrowing heart to die at home , but which had been lately shown by learned antiquaries to be no such thing , as the baron in question -LRB- so they contended -RRB- had died hard in battle , gnashing his teeth and cursing with his latest breath -- the bachelor stoutly maintained that the old tale was the true one ; that the baron , repenting him of the evil , had done great charities and meekly given up the ghost ; and that , if ever baron went to heaven , that baron was then at peace .
Parsing [sent. 7030 len. 144]: In like manner , when the aforesaid antiquaries did argue and contend that a certain secret vault was not the tomb of a grey-haired lady who had been hanged and drawn and quartered by glorious Queen Bess for succouring a wretched priest who fainted of thirst and hunger at her door , the bachelor did solemnly maintain , against all comers , that the church was hallowed by the said poor lady 's ashes ; that her remains had been collected in the night from four of the city 's gates , and thither in secret brought , and there deposited ; and the bachelor did further -LRB- being highly excited at such times -RRB- deny the glory of Queen Bess , and assert the immeasurably greater glory of the meanest woman in her realm , who had a merciful and tender heart .
Parsing [sent. 7031 len. 60]: As to the assertion that the flat stone near the door was not the grave of the miser who had disowned his only child and left a sum of money to the church to buy a peal of bells , the bachelor did readily admit the same , and that the place had given birth to no such man .
Parsing [sent. 7032 len. 26]: In a word , he would have had every stone , and plate of brass , the monument only of deeds whose memory should survive .
Parsing [sent. 7033 len. 8]: All others he was willing to forget .
Parsing [sent. 7034 len. 24]: They might be buried in consecrated ground , but he would have had them buried deep , and never brought to light again .
Parsing [sent. 7035 len. 18]: It was from the lips of such a tutor , that the child learnt her easy task .
Parsing [sent. 7036 len. 48]: Already impressed , beyond all telling , by the silent building and the peaceful beauty of the spot in which it stood -- majestic age surrounded by perpetual youth -- it seemed to her , when she heard these things , sacred to all goodness and virtue .
Parsing [sent. 7037 len. 23]: It was another world , where sin and sorrow never came ; a tranquil place of rest , where nothing evil entered .
Parsing [sent. 7038 len. 130]: When the bachelor had given her in connection with almost every tomb and flat grave-stone some history of its own , he took her down into the old crypt , now a mere dull vault , and showed her how it had been lighted up in the time of the monks , and how , amid lamps depending from the roof , and swinging censers exhaling scented odours , and habits glittering with gold and silver , and pictures , and precious stuffs , and jewels all flashing and glistening through the low arches , the chaunt of aged voices had been many a time heard there , at midnight , in old days , while hooded figures knelt and prayed around , and told their rosaries of beads .
Parsing [sent. 7039 len. 55]: Thence , he took her above ground again , and showed her , high up in the old walls , small galleries , where the nuns had been wont to glide along -- dimly seen in their dark dresses so far off -- or to pause like gloomy shadows , listening to the prayers .
Parsing [sent. 7040 len. 63]: He showed her too , how the warriors , whose figures rested on the tombs , had worn those rotting scraps of armour up above -- how this had been a helmet , and that a shield , and that a gauntlet -- and how they had wielded the great two-handed swords , and beaten men down , with yonder iron mace .
Parsing [sent. 7041 len. 66]: All that he told the child she treasured in her mind ; and sometimes , when she awoke at night from dreams of those old times , and rising from her bed looked out at the dark church , she almost hoped to see the windows lighted up , and hear the organ 's swell , and sound of voices , on the rushing wind .
Parsing [sent. 7042 len. 12]: The old sexton soon got better , and was about again .
Parsing [sent. 7043 len. 15]: From him the child learnt many other things , though of a different kind .
Parsing [sent. 7044 len. 29]: He was not able to work , but one day there was a grave to be made , and he came to overlook the man who dug it .
Parsing [sent. 7045 len. 42]: He was in a talkative mood ; and the child , at first standing by his side , and afterwards sitting on the grass at his feet , with her thoughtful face raised towards his , began to converse with him .
Parsing [sent. 7046 len. 22]: Now , the man who did the sexton 's duty was a little older than he , though much more active .
Parsing [sent. 7047 len. 70]: But he was deaf ; and when the sexton -LRB- who peradventure , on a pinch , might have walked a mile with great difficulty in half-a-dozen hours -RRB- exchanged a remark with him about his work , the child could not help noticing that he did so with an impatient kind of pity for his infirmity , as if he were himself the strongest and heartiest man alive .
Parsing [sent. 7048 len. 21]: ` I 'm sorry to see there is this to do , ' said the child when she approached . '
Parsing [sent. 7049 len. 9]: I heard of no one having died . '
Parsing [sent. 7050 len. 15]: ` She lived in another hamlet , my dear , ' returned the sexton .
Parsing [sent. 7051 len. 6]: ` Three mile away . '
Parsing [sent. 7052 len. 6]: ` Was she young ? '
Parsing [sent. 7053 len. 15]: ` Ye-yes ' said the sexton ; not more than sixty-four , I think .
Parsing [sent. 7054 len. 9]: David , was she more than sixty-four ? '
Parsing [sent. 7055 len. 13]: David , who was digging hard , heard nothing of the question .
Parsing [sent. 7056 len. 37]: The sexton , as he could not reach to touch him with his crutch , and was too infirm to rise without assistance , called his attention by throwing a little mould upon his red nightcap .
Parsing [sent. 7057 len. 8]: ` What 's the matter now ? '
Parsing [sent. 7058 len. 6]: said David , looking up .
Parsing [sent. 7059 len. 8]: ` How old was Becky Morgan ? '
Parsing [sent. 7060 len. 4]: asked the sexton .
Parsing [sent. 7061 len. 5]: ` Becky Morgan ? '
Parsing [sent. 7062 len. 3]: repeated David .
Parsing [sent. 7063 len. 42]: ` Yes , ' replied the sexton ; adding in a half compassionate , half irritable tone , which the old man could n't hear , ` you 're getting very deaf , Davy , very deaf to be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 7064 len. 50]: The old man stopped in his work , and cleansing his spade with a piece of slate he had by him for the purpose -- and scraping off , in the process , the essence of Heaven knows how many Becky Morgans -- set himself to consider the subject .
Parsing [sent. 7065 len. 9]: ` Let me think ' quoth he . '
Parsing [sent. 7066 len. 17]: I saw last night what they had put upon the coffin -- was it seventy-nine ? '
Parsing [sent. 7067 len. 10]: ` No , no , ' said the sexton .
Parsing [sent. 7068 len. 17]: ` Ah yes , it was though , ' returned the old man with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 7069 len. 12]: ` For I remember thinking she was very near our age .
Parsing [sent. 7070 len. 7]: Yes , it was seventy-nine . '
Parsing [sent. 7071 len. 14]: ` Are you sure you did n't mistake a figure , Davy ? '
Parsing [sent. 7072 len. 10]: asked the sexton , with signs of some emotion .
Parsing [sent. 7073 len. 4]: ` What ? '
Parsing [sent. 7074 len. 5]: said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 7075 len. 6]: ` Say that again . '
Parsing [sent. 7076 len. 6]: ` He 's very deaf .
Parsing [sent. 7077 len. 24]: He 's very deaf indeed , ' cried the sexton petulantly ; ` are you sure you 're right about the figures ? '
Parsing [sent. 7078 len. 10]: ` Oh quite , ' replied the old man .
Parsing [sent. 7079 len. 5]: ` Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 7080 len. 14]: ` He 's exceedingly deaf , ' muttered the sexton to himself . '
Parsing [sent. 7081 len. 8]: I think he 's getting foolish . '
Parsing [sent. 7082 len. 35]: The child rather wondered what had led him to this belief , as , to say the truth , the old man seemed quite as sharp as he , and was infinitely more robust .
Parsing [sent. 7083 len. 22]: As the sexton said nothing more just then , however , she forgot it for the time , and spoke again .
Parsing [sent. 7084 len. 15]: ` You were telling me , ' she said , ` about your gardening .
Parsing [sent. 7085 len. 8]: Do you ever plant things here ? '
Parsing [sent. 7086 len. 6]: ` In the churchyard ? '
Parsing [sent. 7087 len. 34]: returned the sexton , ` Not I. ' ' I have seen some flowers and little shrubs about , ' the child rejoined ; ` there are some over there , you see .
Parsing [sent. 7088 len. 16]: I thought they were of your rearing , though indeed they grow but poorly . '
Parsing [sent. 7089 len. 27]: ` They grow as Heaven wills , ' said the old man ; ` and it kindly ordains that they shall never flourish here . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7090 len. 7]: I do not understand you . '
Parsing [sent. 7091 len. 12]: ` Why , this it is , ' said the sexton .
Parsing [sent. 7092 len. 17]: ` They mark the graves of those who had very tender , loving friends . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7093 len. 7]: I was sure they did ! '
Parsing [sent. 7094 len. 5]: the child exclaimed . '
Parsing [sent. 7095 len. 10]: I am very glad to know they do ! '
Parsing [sent. 7096 len. 13]: ` Aye , ' returned the old man , ` but stay .
Parsing [sent. 7097 len. 4]: Look at them .
Parsing [sent. 7098 len. 13]: See how they hang their heads , and droop , and wither .
Parsing [sent. 7099 len. 7]: Do you guess the reason ? '
Parsing [sent. 7100 len. 8]: ` No , ' the child replied .
Parsing [sent. 7101 len. 15]: ` Because the memory of those who lie below , passes away so soon .
Parsing [sent. 7102 len. 54]: At first they tend them , morning , noon , and night ; they soon begin to come less frequently ; from once a day , to once a week ; from once a week to once a month ; then , at long and uncertain intervals ; then , not at all .
Parsing [sent. 7103 len. 6]: Such tokens seldom flourish long .
Parsing [sent. 7104 len. 12]: I have known the briefest summer flowers outlive them . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7105 len. 11]: I grieve to hear it , ' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 7106 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7107 len. 29]: so say the gentlefolks who come down here to look about them , ' returned the old man , shaking his head , ` but I say otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 7108 len. 42]: `` It 's a pretty custom you have in this part of the country , '' they say to me sometimes , `` to plant the graves , but it 's melancholy to see these things all withering or dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 7109 len. 26]: I crave their pardon and tell them that , as I take it , 't is a good sign for the happiness of the living .
Parsing [sent. 7110 len. 5]: And so it is .
Parsing [sent. 7111 len. 5]: It 's nature . '
Parsing [sent. 7112 len. 44]: ` Perhaps the mourners learn to look to the blue sky by day , and to the stars by night , and to think that the dead are there , and not in graves , ' said the child in an earnest voice .
Parsing [sent. 7113 len. 11]: ` Perhaps so , ' replied the old man doubtfully .
Parsing [sent. 7114 len. 6]: ` It may be . '
Parsing [sent. 7115 len. 29]: ` Whether it be as I believe it is , or no , ' thought the child within herself , ` I 'll make this place my garden .
Parsing [sent. 7116 len. 27]: It will be no harm at least to work here day by day , and pleasant thoughts will come of it , I am sure . '
Parsing [sent. 7117 len. 25]: Her glowing cheek and moistened eye passed unnoticed by the sexton , who turned towards old David , and called him by his name .
Parsing [sent. 7118 len. 21]: It was plain that Becky Morgan 's age still troubled him ; though why , the child could scarcely understand .
Parsing [sent. 7119 len. 15]: The second or third repetition of his name attracted the old man 's attention .
Parsing [sent. 7120 len. 20]: Pausing from his work , he leant on his spade , and put his hand to his dull ear .
Parsing [sent. 7121 len. 6]: ` Did you call ? '
Parsing [sent. 7122 len. 4]: he said . '
Parsing [sent. 7123 len. 36]: I have been thinking , Davy , ' replied the sexton , ` that she , ' he pointed to the grave , ` must have been a deal older than you or me . '
Parsing [sent. 7124 len. 25]: ` Seventy-nine , ' answered the old man with a shake of the head , ' I tell you that I saw it . '
Parsing [sent. 7125 len. 5]: ` Saw it ? '
Parsing [sent. 7126 len. 23]: replied the sexton ; ` aye , but , Davy , women do n't always tell the truth about their age . '
Parsing [sent. 7127 len. 21]: ` That 's true indeed , ' said the other old man , with a sudden sparkle in his eye .
Parsing [sent. 7128 len. 8]: ` She might have been older . '
Parsing [sent. 7129 len. 9]: ` I 'm sure she must have been .
Parsing [sent. 7130 len. 9]: Why , only think how old she looked .
Parsing [sent. 7131 len. 10]: You and I seemed but boys to her . '
Parsing [sent. 7132 len. 10]: ` She did look old , ' rejoined David .
Parsing [sent. 7133 len. 5]: ` You 're right .
Parsing [sent. 7134 len. 6]: She did look old . '
Parsing [sent. 7135 len. 36]: ` Call to mind how old she looked for many a long , long year , and say if she could be but seventy-nine at last -- only our age , ' said the sexton .
Parsing [sent. 7136 len. 10]: ` Five year older at the very least ! '
Parsing [sent. 7137 len. 4]: cried the other .
Parsing [sent. 7138 len. 4]: ` Five ! '
Parsing [sent. 7139 len. 4]: retorted the sexton .
Parsing [sent. 7140 len. 3]: ` Ten .
Parsing [sent. 7141 len. 3]: Good eighty-nine .
Parsing [sent. 7142 len. 10]: I call to mind the time her daughter died .
Parsing [sent. 7143 len. 22]: She was eighty-nine if she was a day , and tries to pass upon us now , for ten year younger .
Parsing [sent. 7144 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7145 len. 4]: human vanity ! '
Parsing [sent. 7146 len. 57]: The other old man was not behindhand with some moral reflections on this fruitful theme , and both adduced a mass of evidence , of such weight as to render it doubtful -- not whether the deceased was of the age suggested , but whether she had not almost reached the patriarchal term of a hundred .
Parsing [sent. 7147 len. 24]: When they had settled this question to their mutual satisfaction , the sexton , with his friend 's assistance , rose to go .
Parsing [sent. 7148 len. 29]: ` It 's chilly , sitting here , and I must be careful -- till the summer , ' he said , as he prepared to limp away .
Parsing [sent. 7149 len. 4]: ` What ? '
Parsing [sent. 7150 len. 4]: asked old David .
Parsing [sent. 7151 len. 10]: ` He 's very deaf , poor fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 7152 len. 4]: cried the sexton .
Parsing [sent. 7153 len. 4]: ` Good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 7154 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 7155 len. 8]: said old David , looking after him .
Parsing [sent. 7156 len. 7]: ` He 's failing very fast .
Parsing [sent. 7157 len. 6]: He ages every day . '
Parsing [sent. 7158 len. 64]: And so they parted ; each persuaded that the other had less life in him than himself ; and both greatly consoled and comforted by the little fiction they had agreed upon , respecting Becky Morgan , whose decease was no longer a precedent of uncomfortable application , and would be no business of theirs for half a score of years to come .
Parsing [sent. 7159 len. 53]: The child remained , for some minutes , watching the deaf old man as he threw out the earth with his shovel , and , often stopping to cough and fetch his breath , still muttered to himself , with a kind of sober chuckle , that the sexton was wearing fast .
Parsing [sent. 7160 len. 32]: At length she turned away , and walking thoughtfully through the churchyard , came unexpectedly upon the schoolmaster , who was sitting on a green grave in the sun , reading .
Parsing [sent. 7161 len. 5]: ` Nell here ? '
Parsing [sent. 7162 len. 10]: he said cheerfully , as he closed his book .
Parsing [sent. 7163 len. 14]: ` It does me good to see you in the air and light .
Parsing [sent. 7164 len. 16]: I feared you were again in the church , where you so often are . '
Parsing [sent. 7165 len. 4]: ` Feared ! '
Parsing [sent. 7166 len. 9]: replied the child , sitting down beside him .
Parsing [sent. 7167 len. 9]: ` Is it not a good place ? '
Parsing [sent. 7168 len. 10]: ` Yes , yes , ' said the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 7169 len. 21]: ` But you must be gay sometimes -- nay , do n't shake your head and smile so sadly . '
Parsing [sent. 7170 len. 10]: ` Not sadly , if you knew my heart .
Parsing [sent. 7171 len. 12]: Do not look at me as if you thought me sorrowful .
Parsing [sent. 7172 len. 15]: There is not a happier creature on earth , than I am now . '
Parsing [sent. 7173 len. 18]: Full of grateful tenderness , the child took his hand , and folded it between her own .
Parsing [sent. 7174 len. 8]: ` It 's God 's will ! '
Parsing [sent. 7175 len. 12]: she said , when they had been silent for some time .
Parsing [sent. 7176 len. 4]: ` What ? '
Parsing [sent. 7177 len. 14]: ` All this , ' she rejoined ; ` all this about us .
Parsing [sent. 7178 len. 8]: But which of us is sad now ?
Parsing [sent. 7179 len. 8]: You see that I am smiling . '
Parsing [sent. 7180 len. 25]: ` And so am I , ' said the schoolmaster ; ` smiling to think how often we shall laugh in this same place .
Parsing [sent. 7181 len. 7]: Were you not talking yonder ? '
Parsing [sent. 7182 len. 8]: ` Yes , ` the child rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 7183 len. 10]: ` Of something that has made you sorrowful ? '
Parsing [sent. 7184 len. 6]: There was a long pause .
Parsing [sent. 7185 len. 6]: ` What was it ? '
Parsing [sent. 7186 len. 6]: said the schoolmaster , tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 7187 len. 3]: ` Come .
Parsing [sent. 7188 len. 8]: Tell me what it was . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7189 len. 34]: I rather grieve -- I do rather grieve to think , ' said the child , bursting into tears , ` that those who die about us , are so soon forgotten . '
Parsing [sent. 7190 len. 43]: ` And do you think , ' said the schoolmaster , marking the glance she had thrown around , ` that an unvisited grave , a withered tree , a faded flower or two , are tokens of forgetfulness or cold neglect ?
Parsing [sent. 7191 len. 22]: Do you think there are no deeds , far away from here , in which these dead may be best remembered ?
Parsing [sent. 7192 len. 41]: Nell , Nell , there may be people busy in the world , at this instant , in whose good actions and good thoughts these very graves -- neglected as they look to us -- are the chief instruments . '
Parsing [sent. 7193 len. 12]: ` Tell me no more , ' said the child quickly .
Parsing [sent. 7194 len. 6]: ` Tell me no more .
Parsing [sent. 7195 len. 7]: I feel , I know it .
Parsing [sent. 7196 len. 15]: How could I be unmindful of it , when I thought of you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7197 len. 25]: ` There is nothing , ' cried her friend , ` no , nothing innocent or good , that dies , and is forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 7198 len. 10]: Let us hold to that faith , or none .
Parsing [sent. 7199 len. 56]: An infant , a prattling child , dying in its cradle , will live again in the better thoughts of those who loved it , and will play its part , through them , in the redeeming actions of the world , though its body be burnt to ashes or drowned in the deepest sea .
Parsing [sent. 7200 len. 25]: There is not an angel added to the Host of Heaven but does its blessed work on earth in those that loved it here .
Parsing [sent. 7201 len. 2]: Forgotten !
Parsing [sent. 7202 len. 46]: oh , if the good deeds of human creatures could be traced to their source , how beautiful would even death appear ; for how much charity , mercy , and purified affection , would be seen to have their growth in dusty graves ! '
Parsing [sent. 7203 len. 19]: ` Yes , ' said the child , ` it is the truth ; I know it is .
Parsing [sent. 7204 len. 18]: Who should feel its force so much as I , in whom your little scholar lives again !
Parsing [sent. 7205 len. 18]: Dear , dear , good friend , if you knew the comfort you have given me ! '
Parsing [sent. 7206 len. 21]: The poor schoolmaster made her no answer , but bent over her in silence ; for his heart was full .
Parsing [sent. 7207 len. 14]: They were yet seated in the same place , when the grandfather approached .
Parsing [sent. 7208 len. 23]: Before they had spoken many words together , the church clock struck the hour of school , and their friend withdrew . '
Parsing [sent. 7209 len. 18]: A good man , ' said the grandfather , looking after him ; ' a kind man .
Parsing [sent. 7210 len. 9]: Surely he will never harm us , Nell .
Parsing [sent. 7211 len. 10]: We are safe here , at last , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 7212 len. 9]: We will never go away from here ? '
Parsing [sent. 7213 len. 8]: The child shook her head and smiled .
Parsing [sent. 7214 len. 22]: ` She needs rest , ' said the old man , patting her cheek ; ` too pale -- too pale .
Parsing [sent. 7215 len. 9]: She is not like what she was . '
Parsing [sent. 7216 len. 3]: When ? '
Parsing [sent. 7217 len. 4]: asked the child .
Parsing [sent. 7218 len. 4]: ` Ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 7219 len. 12]: said the old man , ` to be sure -- when ?
Parsing [sent. 7220 len. 5]: How many weeks ago ?
Parsing [sent. 7221 len. 8]: Could I count them on my fingers ?
Parsing [sent. 7222 len. 11]: Let them rest though ; they 're better gone . '
Parsing [sent. 7223 len. 11]: ` Much better , dear , ' replied the child .
Parsing [sent. 7224 len. 30]: ` We will forget them ; or , if we ever call them to mind , it shall be only as some uneasy dream that has passed away . '
Parsing [sent. 7225 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 7226 len. 33]: said the old man , motioning hastily to her with his hand and looking over his shoulder ; ` no more talk of the dream , and all the miseries it brought .
Parsing [sent. 7227 len. 6]: There are no dreams here .
Parsing [sent. 7228 len. 11]: 'T is a quiet place , and they keep away .
Parsing [sent. 7229 len. 14]: Let us never think about them , lest they should pursue us again .
Parsing [sent. 7230 len. 37]: Sunken eyes and hollow cheeks -- wet , cold , and famine -- and horrors before them all , that were even worse -- we must forget such things if we would be tranquil here . '
Parsing [sent. 7231 len. 5]: ` Thank Heaven ! '
Parsing [sent. 7232 len. 14]: inwardly exclaimed the child , ` for this most happy change ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7233 len. 27]: I will be patient , ' said the old man , ` humble , very thankful , and obedient , if you will let me stay .
Parsing [sent. 7234 len. 19]: But do not hide from me ; do not steal away alone ; let me keep beside you .
Parsing [sent. 7235 len. 14]: Indeed , I will be very true and faithful , Nell . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7236 len. 5]: I steal away alone !
Parsing [sent. 7237 len. 20]: why that , ' replied the child , with assumed gaiety , ` would be a pleasant jest indeed .
Parsing [sent. 7238 len. 17]: See here , dear grandfather , we 'll make this place our garden -- why not !
Parsing [sent. 7239 len. 22]: It is a very good one -- and to-morrow we 'll begin , and work together , side by side . '
Parsing [sent. 7240 len. 8]: ` It is a brave thought ! '
Parsing [sent. 7241 len. 4]: cried her grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 7242 len. 10]: ` Mind , darling -- we begin to-morrow ! '
Parsing [sent. 7243 len. 16]: Who so delighted as the old man , when they next day began their labour !
Parsing [sent. 7244 len. 14]: Who so unconscious of all associations connected with the spot , as he !
Parsing [sent. 7245 len. 32]: They plucked the long grass and nettles from the tombs , thinned the poor shrubs and roots , made the turf smooth , and cleared it of the leaves and weeds .
Parsing [sent. 7246 len. 43]: They were yet in the ardour of their work , when the child , raising her head from the ground over which she bent , observed that the bachelor was sitting on the stile close by , watching them in silence . '
Parsing [sent. 7247 len. 19]: A kind office , ' said the little gentleman , nodding to Nell as she curtseyed to him .
Parsing [sent. 7248 len. 11]: ` Have you done all that , this morning ? '
Parsing [sent. 7249 len. 26]: ` It is very little , sir , ' returned the child , with downcast eyes , ` to what we mean to do . '
Parsing [sent. 7250 len. 12]: ` Good work , good work , ' said the bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 7251 len. 17]: ` But do you only labour at the graves of children , and young people ? '
Parsing [sent. 7252 len. 26]: ` We shall come to the others in good time , sir , ' replied Nell , turning her head aside , and speaking softly .
Parsing [sent. 7253 len. 23]: It was a slight incident , and might have been design or accident , or the child 's unconscious sympathy with youth .
Parsing [sent. 7254 len. 17]: But it seemed to strike upon her grandfather , though he had not noticed it before .
Parsing [sent. 7255 len. 30]: He looked in @ hurried manner at the graves , then anxiously at the child , then pressed her to his side , and bade her stop to rest .
Parsing [sent. 7256 len. 14]: Something he had long forgotten , appeared to struggle faintly in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 7257 len. 31]: It did not pass away , as weightier things had done ; but came uppermost again , and yet again , and many times that day , and often afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 7258 len. 46]: Once , while they were yet at work , the child , seeing that he often turned and looked uneasily at her , as though he were trying to resolve some painful doubts or collect some scattered thoughts , urged him to tell the reason .
Parsing [sent. 7259 len. 43]: But he said it was nothing -- nothing -- and , laying her head upon his arm , patted her fair cheek with his hand , and muttered that she grew stronger every day , and would be a woman , soon .
Parsing [sent. 7260 len. 28]: Chapter 55 From that time , there sprung up in the old man 's mind , a solicitude about the child which never slept or left him .
Parsing [sent. 7261 len. 44]: There are chords in the human heart -- strange , varying strings -- which are only struck by accident ; which will remain mute and senseless to appeals the most passionate and earnest , and respond at last to the slightest casual touch .
Parsing [sent. 7262 len. 50]: In the most insensible or childish minds , there is some train of reflection which art can seldom lead , or skill assist , but which will reveal itself , as great truths have done , by chance , and when the discoverer has the plainest end in view .
Parsing [sent. 7263 len. 99]: From that time , the old man never , for a moment , forgot the weakness and devotion of the child ; from the time of that slight incident , he who had seen her toiling by his side through so much difficulty and suffering , and had scarcely thought of her otherwise than as the partner of miseries which he felt severely in his own person , and deplored for his own sake at least as much as hers , awoke to a sense of what he owed her , and what those miseries had made her .
Parsing [sent. 7264 len. 47]: Never , no , never once , in one unguarded moment from that time to the end , did any care for himself , any thought of his own comfort , any selfish consideration or regard distract his thoughts from the gentle object of his love .
Parsing [sent. 7265 len. 98]: He would follow her up and down , waiting till she should tire and lean upon his arm -- he would sit opposite to her in the chimney-corner , content to watch , and look , until she raised her head and smiled upon him as of old -- he would discharge by stealth , those household duties which tasked her powers too heavily -- he would rise , in the cold dark nights , to listen to her breathing in her sleep , and sometimes crouch for hours by her bedside only to touch her hand .
Parsing [sent. 7266 len. 39]: He who knows all , can only know what hopes , and fears , and thoughts of deep affection , were in that one disordered brain , and what a change had fallen on the poor old man .
Parsing [sent. 7267 len. 30]: Sometimes -- weeks had crept on , then -- the child , exhausted , though with little fatigue , would pass whole evenings on a couch beside the fire .
Parsing [sent. 7268 len. 36]: At such times , the schoolmaster would bring in books , and read to her aloud ; and seldom an evening passed , but the bachelor came in , and took his turn of reading .
Parsing [sent. 7269 len. 51]: The old man sat and listened -- with little understanding for the words , but with his eyes fixed upon the child -- and if she smiled or brightened with the story , he would say it was a good one , and conceive a fondness for the very book .
Parsing [sent. 7270 len. 78]: When , in their evening talk , the bachelor told some tale that pleased her -LRB- as his tales were sure to do -RRB- , the old man would painfully try to store it in his mind ; nay , when the bachelor left them , he would sometimes slip out after him , and humbly beg that he would tell him such a part again , that he might learn to win a smile from Nell .
Parsing [sent. 7271 len. 25]: But these were rare occasions , happily ; for the child yearned to be out of doors , and walking in her solemn garden .
Parsing [sent. 7272 len. 40]: Parties , too , would come to see the church ; and those who came , speaking to others of the child , sent more ; so even at that season of the year they had visitors almost daily .
Parsing [sent. 7273 len. 70]: The old man would follow them at a little distance through the building , listening to the voice he loved so well ; and when the strangers left , and parted from Nell , he would mingle with them to catch up fragments of their conversation ; or he would stand for the same purpose , with his grey head uncovered , at the gate as they passed through .
Parsing [sent. 7274 len. 19]: They always praised the child , her sense and beauty , and he was proud to hear them !
Parsing [sent. 7275 len. 27]: But what was that , so often added , which wrung his heart , and made him sob and weep alone , in some dull corner !
Parsing [sent. 7276 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 7277 len. 58]: even careless strangers -- they who had no feeling for her , but the interest of the moment -- they who would go away and forget next week that such a being lived -- even they saw it -- even they pitied her -- even they bade him good day compassionately , and whispered as they passed .
Parsing [sent. 7278 len. 49]: The people of the village , too , of whom there was not one but grew to have a fondness for poor Nell ; even among them , there was the same feeling ; a tenderness towards her -- a compassionate regard for her , increasing every day .
Parsing [sent. 7279 len. 17]: The very schoolboys , light-hearted and thoughtless as they were , even they cared for her .
Parsing [sent. 7280 len. 36]: The roughest among them was sorry if he missed her in the usual place upon his way to school , and would turn out of the path to ask for her at the latticed window .
Parsing [sent. 7281 len. 36]: If she were sitting in the church , they perhaps might peep in softly at the open door ; but they never spoke to her , unless she rose and went to speak to them .
Parsing [sent. 7282 len. 12]: Some feeling was abroad which raised the child above them all .
Parsing [sent. 7283 len. 6]: So , when Sunday came .
Parsing [sent. 7284 len. 38]: They were all poor country people in the church , for the castle in which the old family had lived , was an empty ruin , and there were none but humble folks for seven miles around .
Parsing [sent. 7285 len. 12]: There , as elsewhere , they had an interest in Nell .
Parsing [sent. 7286 len. 37]: They would gather round her in the porch , before and after service ; young children would cluster at her skirts ; and aged men and women forsake their gossips , to give her kindly greeting .
Parsing [sent. 7287 len. 18]: None of them , young or old , thought of passing the child without a friendly word .
Parsing [sent. 7288 len. 25]: Many who came from three or four miles distant , brought her little presents ; the humblest and rudest had good wishes to bestow .
Parsing [sent. 7289 len. 16]: She had sought out the young children whom she first saw playing in the churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 7290 len. 37]: One of these -- he who had spoken of his brother -- was her little favourite and friend , and often sat by her side in the church , or climbed with her to the tower-top .
Parsing [sent. 7291 len. 23]: It was his delight to help her , or to fancy that he did so , and they soon became close companions .
Parsing [sent. 7292 len. 55]: It happened , that , as she was reading in the old spot by herself one day , this child came running in with his eyes full of tears , and after holding her from him , and looking at her eagerly for a moment , clasped his little arms passionately about her neck .
Parsing [sent. 7293 len. 5]: ` What now ? '
Parsing [sent. 7294 len. 6]: said Nell , soothing him .
Parsing [sent. 7295 len. 7]: ` What is the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 7296 len. 8]: ` She is not one yet ! '
Parsing [sent. 7297 len. 10]: cried the boy , embracing her still more closely .
Parsing [sent. 7298 len. 5]: ` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 7299 len. 4]: Not yet . '
Parsing [sent. 7300 len. 24]: She looked at him wonderingly , and putting his hair back from his face , and kissing him , asked what he meant .
Parsing [sent. 7301 len. 15]: ` You must not be one , dear Nell , ' cried the boy .
Parsing [sent. 7302 len. 7]: ` We ca n't see them .
Parsing [sent. 7303 len. 13]: They never come to play with us , or talk to us .
Parsing [sent. 7304 len. 5]: Be what you are .
Parsing [sent. 7305 len. 7]: You are better so . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7306 len. 11]: I do not understand you , ' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 7307 len. 8]: ` Tell me what you mean . '
Parsing [sent. 7308 len. 29]: ` Why , they say , replied the boy , looking up into her face , that you will be an Angel , before the birds sing again .
Parsing [sent. 7309 len. 9]: But you wo n't be , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 7310 len. 12]: Do n't leave us Nell , though the sky is bright .
Parsing [sent. 7311 len. 6]: Do not leave us ! '
Parsing [sent. 7312 len. 14]: The child dropped her head , and put her hands before her face .
Parsing [sent. 7313 len. 9]: ` She can not bear the thought ! '
Parsing [sent. 7314 len. 9]: cried the boy , exulting through his tears .
Parsing [sent. 7315 len. 6]: ` You will not go .
Parsing [sent. 7316 len. 8]: You know how sorry we should be .
Parsing [sent. 7317 len. 12]: Dear Nell , tell me that you 'll stay amongst us .
Parsing [sent. 7318 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7319 len. 11]: Pray , pray , tell me that you will . '
Parsing [sent. 7320 len. 14]: The little creature folded his hands , and knelt down at her feet .
Parsing [sent. 7321 len. 38]: ` Only look at me , Nell , ' said the boy , ` and tell me that you 'll stop , and then I shall know that they are wrong , and will cry no more .
Parsing [sent. 7322 len. 9]: Wo n't you say yes , Nell ? '
Parsing [sent. 7323 len. 19]: Still the drooping head and hidden face , and the child quite silent -- save for her sobs .
Parsing [sent. 7324 len. 42]: ` After a time , ' pursued the boy , trying to draw away her hand , the kind angels will be glad to think that you are not among them , and that you stayed here to be with us .
Parsing [sent. 7325 len. 37]: Willy went away , to join them ; but if he had known how I should miss him in our little bed at night , he never would have left me , I am sure . '
Parsing [sent. 7326 len. 18]: Yet the child could make him no answer , and sobbed as though her heart were bursting .
Parsing [sent. 7327 len. 9]: ` Why would you go , dear Nell ?
Parsing [sent. 7328 len. 18]: I know you would not be happy when you heard that we were crying for your loss .
Parsing [sent. 7329 len. 42]: They say that Willy is in Heaven now , and that it 's always summer there , and yet I 'm sure he grieves when I lie down upon his garden bed , and he can not turn to kiss me .
Parsing [sent. 7330 len. 32]: But if you do go , Nell , ' said the boy , caressing her , and pressing his face to hers , ` be fond of him for my sake .
Parsing [sent. 7331 len. 51]: Tell him how I love him still , and how much I loved you ; and when I think that you two are together , and are happy , I 'll try to bear it , and never give you pain by doing wrong -- indeed I never will ! '
Parsing [sent. 7332 len. 16]: The child suffered him to move her hands , and put them round his neck .
Parsing [sent. 7333 len. 50]: There was a tearful silence , but it was not long before she looked upon him with a smile , and promised him , in a very gentle , quiet voice , that she would stay , and be his friend , as long as Heaven would let her .
Parsing [sent. 7334 len. 36]: He clapped his hands for joy , and thanked her many times ; and being charged to tell no person what had passed between them , gave her an earnest promise that he never would .
Parsing [sent. 7335 len. 48]: Nor did he , so far as the child could learn ; but was her quiet companion in all her walks and musings , and never again adverted to the theme , which he felt had given her pain , although he was unconscious of its cause .
Parsing [sent. 7336 len. 74]: Something of distrust lingered about him still ; for he would often come , even in the dark evenings , and call in a timid voice outside the door to know if she were safe within ; and being answered yes , and bade to enter , would take his station on a low stool at her feet , and sit there patiently until they came to seek , and take him home .
Parsing [sent. 7337 len. 47]: Sure as the morning came , it found him lingering near the house to ask if she were well ; and , morning , noon , or night , go where she would , he would forsake his playmates and his sports to bear her company .
Parsing [sent. 7338 len. 20]: ` And a good little friend he is , too , ' said the old sexton to her once .
Parsing [sent. 7339 len. 32]: ` When his elder brother died -- elder seems a strange word , for he was only seven years old -- I remember this one took it sorely to heart . '
Parsing [sent. 7340 len. 24]: The child thought of what the schoolmaster had told her , and felt how its truth was shadowed out even in this infant .
Parsing [sent. 7341 len. 31]: ` It has given him something of a quiet way , I think , ' said the old man , ` though for that he is merry enough at times .
Parsing [sent. 7342 len. 17]: I 'd wager now that you and he have been listening by the old well . '
Parsing [sent. 7343 len. 12]: ` Indeed we have not , ' the child replied . '
Parsing [sent. 7344 len. 30]: I have been afraid to go near it ; for I am not often down in that part of the church , and do not know the ground . '
Parsing [sent. 7345 len. 13]: ` Come down with me , ' said the old man . '
Parsing [sent. 7346 len. 8]: I have known it from a boy .
Parsing [sent. 7347 len. 3]: Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 7348 len. 25]: They descended the narrow steps which led into the crypt , and paused among the gloomy arches , in a dim and murky spot .
Parsing [sent. 7349 len. 12]: ` This is the place , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 7350 len. 20]: ` Give me your hand while you throw back the cover , lest you should stumble and fall in .
Parsing [sent. 7351 len. 16]: I am too old -- I mean rheumatic -- to stoop , myself . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7352 len. 7]: A black and dreadful place ! '
Parsing [sent. 7353 len. 4]: exclaimed the child .
Parsing [sent. 7354 len. 16]: ` Look in , ' said the old man , pointing downward with his finger .
Parsing [sent. 7355 len. 11]: The child complied , and gazed down into the pit .
Parsing [sent. 7356 len. 14]: ` It looks like a grave itself , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 7357 len. 10]: ` It does , ' replied the child . '
Parsing [sent. 7358 len. 36]: I have often had the fancy , ' said the sexton , ` that it might have been dug at first to make the old place more gloomy , and the old monks more religious .
Parsing [sent. 7359 len. 12]: It 's to be closed up , and built over . '
Parsing [sent. 7360 len. 11]: The child still stood , looking thoughtfully into the vault .
Parsing [sent. 7361 len. 30]: ` We shall see , ' said the sexton , ` on what gay heads other earth will have closed , when the light is shut out from here .
Parsing [sent. 7362 len. 3]: God knows !
Parsing [sent. 7363 len. 10]: They 'll close it up , next spring . '
Parsing [sent. 7364 len. 28]: ` The birds sing again in spring , ' thought the child , as she leaned at her casement window , and gazed at the declining sun .
Parsing [sent. 7365 len. 3]: ` Spring !
Parsing [sent. 7366 len. 7]: a beautiful and happy time ! '
Parsing [sent. 7367 len. 73]: Chapter 56 A day or two after the Quilp tea-party at the Wilderness , Mr Swiveller walked into Sampson Brass 's office at the usual hour , and being alone in that Temple of Probity , placed his hat upon the desk , and taking from his pocket a small parcel of black crape , applied himself to folding and pinning the same upon it , after the manner of a hatband .
Parsing [sent. 7368 len. 37]: Having completed the construction of this appendage , he surveyed his work with great complacency , and put his hat on again -- very much over one eye , to increase the mournfulness of the effect .
Parsing [sent. 7369 len. 27]: These arrangements perfected to his entire satisfaction , he thrust his hands into his pockets , and walked up and down the office with measured steps .
Parsing [sent. 7370 len. 18]: ` It has always been the same with me , ' said Mr Swiveller , ` always .
Parsing [sent. 7371 len. 71]: 'T was ever thus -- from childhood 's hour I 've seen my fondest hopes decay , I never loved a tree or flower but 't was the first to fade away ; I never nursed a dear Gazelle , to glad me with its soft black eye , but when it came to know me well , and love me , it was sure to marry a market-gardener . '
Parsing [sent. 7372 len. 23]: Overpowered by these reflections , Mr Swiveller stopped short at the clients ' chair , and flung himself into its open arms .
Parsing [sent. 7373 len. 23]: ` And this , ' said Mr Swiveller , with a kind of bantering composure , ` is life , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 7374 len. 4]: Oh , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 7375 len. 3]: Why not !
Parsing [sent. 7376 len. 5]: I 'm quite satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 7377 len. 88]: I shall wear , ' added Richard , taking off his hat again and looking hard at it , as if he were only deterred by pecuniary considerations from spurning it with his foot , ' I shall wear this emblem of woman 's perfidy , in remembrance of her with whom I shall never again thread the windings of the mazy ; whom I shall never more pledge in the rosy ; who , during the short remainder of my existence , will murder the balmy .
Parsing [sent. 7378 len. 7]: Ha , ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 7379 len. 109]: It may be necessary to observe , lest there should appear any incongruity in the close of this soliloquy , that Mr Swiveller did not wind up with a cheerful hilarious laugh , which would have been undoubtedly at variance with his solemn reflections , but that , being in a theatrical mood , he merely achieved that performance which is designated in melodramas ` laughing like a fiend , ' -- for it seems that your fiends always laugh in syllables , and always in three syllables , never more nor less , which is a remarkable property in such gentry , and one worthy of remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 7380 len. 52]: The baleful sounds had hardly died away , and Mr Swiveller was still sitting in a very grim state in the clients ' chair , when there came a ring -- or , if we may adapt the sound to his then humour , a knell -- at the office bell .
Parsing [sent. 7381 len. 25]: Opening the door with all speed , he beheld the expressive countenance of Mr Chuckster , between whom and himself a fraternal greeting ensued .
Parsing [sent. 7382 len. 31]: ` You 're devilish early at this pestiferous old slaughter-house , ' said that gentleman , poising himself on one leg , and shaking the other in an easy manner .
Parsing [sent. 7383 len. 7]: ` Rather , ' returned Dick .
Parsing [sent. 7384 len. 4]: ` Rather ! '
Parsing [sent. 7385 len. 17]: retorted Mr Chuckster , with that air of graceful trifling which so well became him . '
Parsing [sent. 7386 len. 5]: I should think so .
Parsing [sent. 7387 len. 22]: Why , my good feller , do you know what o'clock it is -- half-past nine a.m. in the morning ? '
Parsing [sent. 7388 len. 8]: ` Wo n't you come in ? '
Parsing [sent. 7389 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 7390 len. 4]: ` All alone .
Parsing [sent. 7391 len. 4]: Swiveller solus . ''
Parsing [sent. 7392 len. 16]: 'T is now the witching -- ' ' `` Hour of night ! '' ' '
Parsing [sent. 7393 len. 18]: `` When churchyards yawn , '' ' ' `` And graves give up their dead . '' '
Parsing [sent. 7394 len. 25]: At the end of this quotation in dialogue , each gentleman struck an attitude , and immediately subsiding into prose walked into the office .
Parsing [sent. 7395 len. 30]: Such morsels of enthusiasm are common among the Glorious Apollos , and were indeed the links that bound them together , and raised them above the cold dull earth .
Parsing [sent. 7396 len. 11]: ` Well , and how are you my buck ? '
Parsing [sent. 7397 len. 9]: said Mr Chuckster , taking a stool . '
Parsing [sent. 7398 len. 42]: I was forced to come into the City upon some little private matters of my own , and could n't pass the corner of the street without looking in , but upon my soul I did n't expect to find you .
Parsing [sent. 7399 len. 7]: It is so everlastingly early . '
Parsing [sent. 7400 len. 72]: Mr Swiveller expressed his acknowledgments ; and it appearing on further conversation that he was in good health , and that Mr Chuckster was in the like enviable condition , both gentlemen , in compliance with a solemn custom of the ancient Brotherhood to which they belonged , joined in a fragment of the popular duet of ` All 's Well , ' with a long shake ' at the end .
Parsing [sent. 7401 len. 8]: ` And what 's the news ? '
Parsing [sent. 7402 len. 3]: said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 7403 len. 25]: ` The town 's as flat , my dear feller , ' replied Mr Chuckster , ` as the surface of a Dutch oven .
Parsing [sent. 7404 len. 5]: There 's no news .
Parsing [sent. 7405 len. 12]: By-the-bye , that lodger of yours is a most extraordinary person .
Parsing [sent. 7406 len. 11]: He quite eludes the most vigorous comprehension , you know .
Parsing [sent. 7407 len. 7]: Never was such a feller ! '
Parsing [sent. 7408 len. 9]: ` What has he been doing now ? '
Parsing [sent. 7409 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 7410 len. 39]: ` By Jove , Sir , ' returned Mr Chuckster , taking out an oblong snuff-box , the lid whereof was ornamented with a fox 's head curiously carved in brass , ` that man is an unfathomable .
Parsing [sent. 7411 len. 12]: Sir , that man has made friends with our articled clerk .
Parsing [sent. 7412 len. 16]: There 's no harm in him , but he is so amazingly slow and soft .
Parsing [sent. 7413 len. 33]: Now , if he wanted a friend , why could n't he have one that knew a thing or two , and could do him some good by his manners and conversation .
Parsing [sent. 7414 len. 22]: I have my faults , sir , ' said Mr Chuckster -- ` No , no , ' interposed Mr Swiveller .
Parsing [sent. 7415 len. 22]: ` Oh yes I have , I have my faults , no man knows his faults better than I know mine .
Parsing [sent. 7416 len. 13]: But , ' said Mr Chuckster , ` I 'm not meek .
Parsing [sent. 7417 len. 24]: My worst enemies -- every man has his enemies , Sir , and I have mine -- never accused me of being meek .
Parsing [sent. 7418 len. 46]: And I tell you what , Sir , if I had n't more of these qualities that commonly endear man to man , than our articled clerk has , I 'd steal a Cheshire cheese , tie it round my neck , and drown myself .
Parsing [sent. 7419 len. 10]: I 'd die degraded , as I had lived .
Parsing [sent. 7420 len. 7]: I would upon my honour . '
Parsing [sent. 7421 len. 54]: Mr Chuckster paused , rapped the fox 's head exactly on the nose with the knuckle of the fore-finger , took a pinch of snuff , and looked steadily at Mr Swiveller , as much as to say that if he thought he was going to sneeze , he would find himself mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 7422 len. 29]: ` Not contented , Sir , ' said Mr Chuckster , ` with making friends with Abel , he has cultivated the acquaintance of his father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 7423 len. 18]: Since he came home from that wild-goose chase , he has been there -- actually been there .
Parsing [sent. 7424 len. 47]: He patronises young Snobby besides ; you 'll find , Sir , that he 'll be constantly coming backwards and forwards to this place : yet I do n't suppose that beyond the common forms of civility , he has ever exchanged half-a-dozen words with me .
Parsing [sent. 7425 len. 75]: Now , upon my soul , you know , ' said Mr Chuckster , shaking his head gravely , as men are wont to do when they consider things are going a little too far , ` this is altogether such a low-minded affair , that if I did n't feel for the governor , and know that he could never get on without me , I should be obliged to cut the connection .
Parsing [sent. 7426 len. 7]: I should have no alternative . '
Parsing [sent. 7427 len. 26]: Mr Swiveller , who sat on another stool opposite to his friend , stirred the fire in an excess of sympathy , but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7428 len. 27]: ` As to young Snob , sir , ' pursued Mr Chuckster with a prophetic look , ` you 'll find he 'll turn out bad .
Parsing [sent. 7429 len. 41]: In our profession we know something of human nature , and take my word for it , that the feller that came back to work out that shilling , will show himself one of these days in his true colours .
Parsing [sent. 7430 len. 8]: He 's a low thief , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7431 len. 5]: He must be . '
Parsing [sent. 7432 len. 57]: Mr Chuckster being roused , would probably have pursued this subject further , and in more emphatic language , but for a tap at the door , which seeming to announce the arrival of somebody on business , caused him to assume a greater appearance of meekness than was perhaps quite consistent with his late declaration .
Parsing [sent. 7433 len. 54]: Mr Swiveller , hearing the same sound , caused his stool to revolve rapidly on one leg until it brought him to his desk , into which , having forgotten in the sudden flurry of his spirits to part with the poker , he thrust it as he cried ` Come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 7434 len. 19]: Who should present himself but that very Kit who had been the theme of Mr Chuckster 's wrath !
Parsing [sent. 7435 len. 25]: Never did man pluck up his courage so quickly , or look so fierce , as Mr Chuckster when he found it was he .
Parsing [sent. 7436 len. 45]: Mr Swiveller stared at him for a moment , and then leaping from his stool , and drawing out the poker from its place of concealment , performed the broad-sword exercise with all the cuts and guards complete , in a species of frenzy .
Parsing [sent. 7437 len. 8]: ` Is the gentleman at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 7438 len. 10]: said Kit , rather astonished by this uncommon reception .
Parsing [sent. 7439 len. 96]: Before Mr Swiveller could make any reply , Mr Chuckster took occasion to enter his indignant protest against this form of inquiry ; which he held to be of a disrespectful and snobbish tendency , inasmuch as the inquirer , seeing two gentlemen then and there present , should have spoken of the other gentleman ; or rather -LRB- for it was not impossible that the object of his search might be of inferior quality -RRB- should have mentioned his name , leaving it to his hearers to determine his degree as they thought proper .
Parsing [sent. 7440 len. 54]: Mr Chuckster likewise remarked , that he had some reason to believe this form of address was personal to himself , and that he was not a man to be trifled with -- as certain snobs -LRB- whom he did not more particularly mention or describe -RRB- might find to their cost . '
Parsing [sent. 7441 len. 15]: I mean the gentleman up-stairs , ' said Kit , turning to Richard Swiveller .
Parsing [sent. 7442 len. 7]: ` Is he at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 7443 len. 4]: ` Why ? '
Parsing [sent. 7444 len. 3]: rejoined Dick .
Parsing [sent. 7445 len. 14]: ` Because if he is , I have a letter for him . '
Parsing [sent. 7446 len. 5]: ` From whom ? '
Parsing [sent. 7447 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 7448 len. 6]: ` From Mr Garland . '
Parsing [sent. 7449 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 7450 len. 7]: said Dick , with extreme politeness .
Parsing [sent. 7451 len. 10]: ` Then you may hand it over , Sir .
Parsing [sent. 7452 len. 32]: And if you 're to wait for an answer , Sir , you may wait in the passage , Sir , which is an airy and well-ventilated apartment , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 7453 len. 8]: ` Thank you , ' returned Kit .
Parsing [sent. 7454 len. 15]: ` But I am to give it to himself , if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 7455 len. 111]: The excessive audacity of this retort so overpowered Mr Chuckster , and so moved his tender regard for his friend 's honour , that he declared , if he were not restrained by official considerations , he must certainly have annihilated Kit upon the spot ; a resentment of the affront which he did consider , under the extraordinary circumstances of aggravation attending it , could but have met with the proper sanction and approval of a jury of Englishmen , who , he had no doubt , would have returned a verdict of justifiable Homicide , coupled with a high testimony to the morals and character of the Avenger .
Parsing [sent. 7456 len. 51]: Mr Swiveller , without being quite so hot upon the matter , was rather shamed by his friend 's excitement , and not a little puzzled how to act -LRB- Kit being quite cool and good-humoured -RRB- , when the single gentleman was heard to call violently down the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 7457 len. 13]: ` Did n't I see somebody for me , come in ? '
Parsing [sent. 7458 len. 4]: cried the lodger .
Parsing [sent. 7459 len. 9]: ` Yes , Sir , ' replied Dick .
Parsing [sent. 7460 len. 6]: ` Certainly , Sir . '
Parsing [sent. 7461 len. 7]: ` Then where is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 7462 len. 5]: roared the single gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 7463 len. 12]: ` He 's here , sir , ' rejoined Mr Swiveller .
Parsing [sent. 7464 len. 15]: ` Now young man , do n't you hear you 're to go up-stairs ?
Parsing [sent. 7465 len. 5]: Are you deaf ? '
Parsing [sent. 7466 len. 31]: Kit did not appear to think it worth his while to enter into any altercation , but hurried off and left the Glorious Apollos gazing at each other in silence .
Parsing [sent. 7467 len. 9]: ` Did n't I tell you so ? '
Parsing [sent. 7468 len. 4]: said Mr Chuckster .
Parsing [sent. 7469 len. 9]: ` What do you think of that ? '
Parsing [sent. 7470 len. 31]: Mr Swiveller being in the main a good-natured fellow , and not perceiving in the conduct of Kit any villany of enormous magnitude , scarcely knew what answer to return .
Parsing [sent. 7471 len. 30]: He was relieved from his perplexity , however , by the entrance of Mr Sampson and his sister , Sally , at sight of whom Mr Chuckster precipitately retired .
Parsing [sent. 7472 len. 27]: Mr Brass and his lovely companion appeared to have been holding a consultation over their temperate breakfast , upon some matter of great interest and importance .
Parsing [sent. 7473 len. 49]: On the occasion of such conferences , they generally appeared in the office some half an hour after their usual time , and in a very smiling state , as though their late plots and designs had tranquillised their minds and shed a light upon their toilsome way .
Parsing [sent. 7474 len. 35]: In the present instance , they seemed particularly gay ; Miss Sally 's aspect being of a most oily kind , and Mr Brass rubbing his hands in an exceedingly jocose and light-hearted manner .
Parsing [sent. 7475 len. 10]: ` Well , Mr Richard , ' said Brass .
Parsing [sent. 7476 len. 7]: ` How are we this morning ?
Parsing [sent. 7477 len. 14]: Are we pretty fresh and cheerful sir -- eh , Mr Richard ? '
Parsing [sent. 7478 len. 10]: ` Pretty well , sir , ' replied Dick .
Parsing [sent. 7479 len. 9]: ` That 's well , ' said Brass .
Parsing [sent. 7480 len. 4]: ` Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 7481 len. 14]: We should be as gay as larks , Mr Richard -- why not ?
Parsing [sent. 7482 len. 15]: It 's a pleasant world we live in sir , a very pleasant world .
Parsing [sent. 7483 len. 25]: There are bad people in it , Mr Richard , but if there were no bad people , there would be no good lawyers .
Parsing [sent. 7484 len. 3]: Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 7485 len. 12]: Any letters by the post this morning , Mr Richard ? '
Parsing [sent. 7486 len. 7]: Mr Swiveller answered in the negative .
Parsing [sent. 7487 len. 4]: ` Ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 7488 len. 7]: said Brass , ` no matter .
Parsing [sent. 7489 len. 13]: If there 's little business to-day , there 'll be more to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 7490 len. 13]: A contented spirit , Mr Richard , is the sweetness of existence .
Parsing [sent. 7491 len. 7]: Anybody been here , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 7492 len. 10]: ` Only my friend ' -- replied Dick . '
Parsing [sent. 7493 len. 26]: `` May we ne'er want a -- ' ` Friend , ' Brass chimed in quickly , ` or a bottle to give him . '
Parsing [sent. 7494 len. 3]: Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 7495 len. 12]: That 's the way the song runs , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 7496 len. 11]: A very good song , Mr Richard , very good .
Parsing [sent. 7497 len. 7]: I like the sentiment of it .
Parsing [sent. 7498 len. 3]: Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 7499 len. 32]: Your friend 's the young man from Witherden 's office I think -- yes -- May we ne'er want a -- Nobody else at all , been , Mr Richard ? '
Parsing [sent. 7500 len. 12]: ` Only somebody to the lodger , ' replied Mr Swiveller .
Parsing [sent. 7501 len. 5]: ` Oh indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 7502 len. 3]: cried Brass .
Parsing [sent. 7503 len. 7]: ` Somebody to the lodger eh ?
Parsing [sent. 7504 len. 3]: Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 7505 len. 21]: May we ne'er want a friend , or a -- Somebody to the lodger , eh , Mr Richard ? '
Parsing [sent. 7506 len. 21]: ` Yes , ' said Dick , a little disconcerted by the excessive buoyancy of spirits which his employer displayed .
Parsing [sent. 7507 len. 6]: ` With him now . '
Parsing [sent. 7508 len. 6]: ` With him now ! '
Parsing [sent. 7509 len. 7]: cried Brass ; ` Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 7510 len. 14]: There let 'em be , merry and free , toor rul rol le .
Parsing [sent. 7511 len. 5]: Eh , Mr Richard ?
Parsing [sent. 7512 len. 4]: Ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 7513 len. 8]: ` Oh certainly , ' replied Dick .
Parsing [sent. 7514 len. 34]: ` And who , ' said Brass , shuffling among his papers , ` who is the lodger 's visitor -- not a lady visitor , I hope , eh , Mr Richard ?
Parsing [sent. 7515 len. 29]: The morals of the Marks you know , sir -- `` when lovely women stoops to folly '' -- and all that -- eh , Mr Richard ? '
Parsing [sent. 7516 len. 21]: ` Another young man , who belongs to Witherden 's too , or half belongs there , ' returned Richard .
Parsing [sent. 7517 len. 8]: ` Kit , they call him . '
Parsing [sent. 7518 len. 6]: ` Kit , eh ! '
Parsing [sent. 7519 len. 3]: said Brass .
Parsing [sent. 7520 len. 16]: ` Strange name -- name of a dancing-master 's fiddle , eh , Mr Richard ?
Parsing [sent. 7521 len. 3]: Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 7522 len. 7]: Kit 's there , is he ?
Parsing [sent. 7523 len. 3]: Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 7524 len. 58]: Dick looked at Miss Sally , wondering that she did n't check this uncommon exuberance on the part of Mr Sampson ; but as she made no attempt to do so , and rather appeared to exhibit a tacit acquiescence in it , he concluded that they had just been cheating somebody , and receiving the bill .
Parsing [sent. 7525 len. 32]: ` Will you have the goodness , Mr Richard , ' said Brass , taking a letter from his desk , ` just to step over to Peckham Rye with that ?
Parsing [sent. 7526 len. 16]: There 's no answer , but it 's rather particular and should go by hand .
Parsing [sent. 7527 len. 36]: Charge the office with your coach-hire back , you know ; do n't spare the office ; get as much out of it as you can -- clerk 's motto -- Eh , Mr Richard ?
Parsing [sent. 7528 len. 4]: Ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 7529 len. 28]: Mr Swiveller solemnly doffed the aquatic jacket , put on his coat , took down his hat from its peg , pocketed the letter , and departed .
Parsing [sent. 7530 len. 32]: As soon as he was gone , up rose Miss Sally Brass , and smiling sweetly at her brother -LRB- who nodded and smote his nose in return -RRB- withdrew also .
Parsing [sent. 7531 len. 100]: Sampson Brass was no sooner left alone , than he set the office-door wide open , and establishing himself at his desk directly opposite , so that he could not fail to see anybody who came down-stairs and passed out at the street door , began to write with extreme cheerfulness and assiduity ; humming as he did so , in a voice that was anything but musical , certain vocal snatches which appeared to have reference to the union between Church and State , inasmuch as they were compounded of the Evening Hymn and God save the King .
Parsing [sent. 7532 len. 47]: Thus , the attorney of Bevis Marks sat , and wrote , and hummed , for a long time , except when he stopped to listen with a very cunning face , and hearing nothing , went on humming louder , and writing slower than ever .
Parsing [sent. 7533 len. 26]: At length , in one of these pauses , he heard his lodger 's door opened and shut , and footsteps coming down the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 7534 len. 51]: Then , Mr Brass left off writing entirely , and , with his pen in his hand , hummed his very loudest ; shaking his head meanwhile from side to side , like a man whose whole soul was in the music , and smiling in a manner quite seraphic .
Parsing [sent. 7535 len. 49]: It was towards this moving spectacle that the staircase and the sweet sounds guided Kit ; on whose arrival before his door , Mr Brass stopped his singing , but not his smiling , and nodded affably : at the same time beckoning to him with his pen .
Parsing [sent. 7536 len. 21]: ` Kit , ' said Mr Brass , in the pleasantest way imaginable , ` how do you do ? '
Parsing [sent. 7537 len. 33]: Kit , being rather shy of his friend , made a suitable reply , and had his hand upon the lock of the street door when Mr Brass called him softly back .
Parsing [sent. 7538 len. 25]: ` You are not to go , if you please , Kit , ' said the attorney in a mysterious and yet business-like way .
Parsing [sent. 7539 len. 12]: ` You are to step in here , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 7540 len. 6]: Dear me , dear me !
Parsing [sent. 7541 len. 41]: When I look at you , ' said the lawyer , quitting his stool , and standing before the fire with his back towards it , ' I am reminded of the sweetest little face that ever my eyes beheld .
Parsing [sent. 7542 len. 16]: I remember your coming there , twice or thrice , when we were in possession .
Parsing [sent. 7543 len. 33]: Ah Kit , my dear fellow , gentleman in my profession have such painful duties to perform sometimes , that you need n't envy us -- you need n't indeed ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7544 len. 24]: I do n't , sir , ' said Kit , ` though it is n't for the like of me to judge . '
Parsing [sent. 7545 len. 57]: ` Our only consolation , Kit , ' pursued the lawyer , looking at him in a sort of pensive abstraction , ` is , that although we can not turn away the wind , we can soften it ; we can temper it , if I may say so , to the shorn lambs . '
Parsing [sent. 7546 len. 5]: ` Shorn indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 7547 len. 3]: thought Kit .
Parsing [sent. 7548 len. 5]: ` Pretty close ! '
Parsing [sent. 7549 len. 7]: But he did n't say SO .
Parsing [sent. 7550 len. 49]: ` On that occasion , Kit , ' said Mr Brass , ` on that occasion that I have just alluded to , I had a hard battle with Mr Quilp -LRB- for Mr Quilp is a very hard man -RRB- to obtain them the indulgence they had .
Parsing [sent. 7551 len. 8]: It might have cost me a client .
Parsing [sent. 7552 len. 11]: But suffering virtue inspired me , and I prevailed . '
Parsing [sent. 7553 len. 35]: ` He 's not so bad after all , ' thought honest Kit , as the attorney pursed up his lips and looked like a man who was struggling with his better feelings . '
Parsing [sent. 7554 len. 13]: I respect you , Kit , ' said Brass with emotion . '
Parsing [sent. 7555 len. 26]: I saw enough of your conduct , at that time , to respect you , though your station is humble , and your fortune lowly .
Parsing [sent. 7556 len. 10]: It is n't the waistcoat that I look at .
Parsing [sent. 7557 len. 5]: It is the heart .
Parsing [sent. 7558 len. 13]: The checks in the waistcoat are but the wires of the cage .
Parsing [sent. 7559 len. 7]: But the heart is the bird .
Parsing [sent. 7560 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7561 len. 22]: How many sich birds are perpetually moulting , and putting their beaks through the wires to peck at all mankind ! '
Parsing [sent. 7562 len. 80]: This poetic figure , which Kit took to be in a special allusion to his own checked waistcoat , quite overcame him ; Mr Brass 's voice and manner added not a little to its effect , for he discoursed with all the mild austerity of a hermit , and wanted but a cord round the waist of his rusty surtout , and a skull on the chimney-piece , to be completely set up in that line of business .
Parsing [sent. 7563 len. 37]: ` Well , well , ' said Sampson , smiling as good men smile when they compassionate their own weakness or that of their fellow-creatures , ` this is wide of the bull 's - eye .
Parsing [sent. 7564 len. 11]: You 're to take that , if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 7565 len. 15]: As he spoke , he pointed to a couple of half-crowns on the desk .
Parsing [sent. 7566 len. 14]: Kit looked at the coins , and then at Sampson , and hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 7567 len. 8]: ` For yourself , ' said Brass .
Parsing [sent. 7568 len. 19]: ` From -- ' ` No matter about the person they came from , ' replied the lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 7569 len. 8]: ` Say me , if you like .
Parsing [sent. 7570 len. 22]: We have eccentric friends overhead , Kit , and we must n't ask questions or talk too much -- you understand ?
Parsing [sent. 7571 len. 35]: You 're to take them , that 's all ; and between you and me , I do n't think they 'll be the last you 'll have to take from the same place .
Parsing [sent. 7572 len. 4]: I hope not .
Parsing [sent. 7573 len. 5]: Good bye , Kit .
Parsing [sent. 7574 len. 4]: Good bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 7575 len. 47]: With many thanks , and many more self-reproaches for having on such slight grounds suspected one who in their very first conversation turned out such a different man from what he had supposed , Kit took the money and made the best of his way home .
Parsing [sent. 7576 len. 22]: Mr Brass remained airing himself at the fire , and resumed his vocal exercise , and his seraphic smile , simultaneously .
Parsing [sent. 7577 len. 7]: ` May I come in ? '
Parsing [sent. 7578 len. 6]: said Miss Sally , peeping .
Parsing [sent. 7579 len. 14]: ` Oh yes , you may come in , ' returned her brother .
Parsing [sent. 7580 len. 4]: ` Ahem ! '
Parsing [sent. 7581 len. 5]: coughed Miss Brass interrogatively .
Parsing [sent. 7582 len. 19]: ` Why , yes , ' returned Sampson , ' I should say as good as done . '
Parsing [sent. 7583 len. 12]: Chapter 57 Mr Chuckster 's indignant apprehensions were not without foundation .
Parsing [sent. 7584 len. 25]: Certainly the friendship between the single gentleman and Mr Garland was not suffered to cool , but had a rapid growth and flourished exceedingly .
Parsing [sent. 7585 len. 78]: They were soon in habits of constant intercourse and communication ; and the single gentleman labouring at this time under a slight attack of illness -- the consequence most probably of his late excited feelings and subsequent disappointment -- furnished a reason for their holding yet more frequent correspondence ; so that some one of the inmates of Abel Cottage , Finchley , came backwards and forwards between that place and Bevis Marks , almost every day .
Parsing [sent. 7586 len. 53]: As the pony had now thrown off all disguise , and without any mincing of the matter or beating about the bush , sturdily refused to be driven by anybody but Kit , it generally happened that whether old Mr Garland came , or Mr Abel , Kit was of the party .
Parsing [sent. 7587 len. 48]: Of all messages and inquiries , Kit was , in right of his position , the bearer ; thus it came about that , while the single gentleman remained indisposed , Kit turned into Bevis Marks every morning with nearly as much regularity as the General Postman .
Parsing [sent. 7588 len. 38]: Mr Sampson Brass , who no doubt had his reasons for looking sharply about him , soon learnt to distinguish the pony 's trot and the clatter of the little chaise at the corner of the street .
Parsing [sent. 7589 len. 26]: Whenever the sound reached his ears , he would immediately lay down his pen and fall to rubbing his hands and exhibiting the greatest glee .
Parsing [sent. 7590 len. 5]: ` Ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 7591 len. 4]: he would cry .
Parsing [sent. 7592 len. 7]: ` Here 's the pony again !
Parsing [sent. 7593 len. 16]: Most remarkable pony , extremely docile , eh , Mr Richard , eh sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 7594 len. 43]: Dick would return some matter-of-course reply , and Mr Brass standing on the bottom rail of his stool , so as to get a view of the street over the top of the window-blind , would take an observation of the visitors .
Parsing [sent. 7595 len. 7]: ` The old gentleman again ! '
Parsing [sent. 7596 len. 28]: he would exclaim , ' a very prepossessing old gentleman , Mr Richard -- charming countenance sir -- extremely calm -- benevolence in every feature , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7597 len. 43]: He quite realises my idea of King Lear , as he appeared when in possession of his kingdom , Mr Richard -- the same good humour , the same white hair and partial baldness , the same liability to be imposed upon .
Parsing [sent. 7598 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7599 len. 12]: A sweet subject for contemplation , sir , very sweet ! '
Parsing [sent. 7600 len. 41]: Then Mr Garland having alighted and gone up-stairs , Sampson would nod and smile to Kit from the window , and presently walk out into the street to greet him , when some such conversation as the following would ensue .
Parsing [sent. 7601 len. 28]: ` Admirably groomed , Kit ' -- Mr Brass is patting the pony -- ` does you great credit -- amazingly sleek and bright to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 7602 len. 13]: He literally looks as if he had been varnished all over . '
Parsing [sent. 7603 len. 30]: Kit touches his hat , smiles , pats the pony himself , and expresses his conviction , ` that Mr Brass will not find many like him . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7604 len. 6]: A beautiful animal indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 7605 len. 3]: cries Brass .
Parsing [sent. 7606 len. 5]: ` Sagacious too ? '
Parsing [sent. 7607 len. 5]: ` Bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 7608 len. 19]: replies Kit , ` he knows what you say to him as well as a Christian does . '
Parsing [sent. 7609 len. 6]: ` Does he indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 7610 len. 32]: cries Brass , who has heard the same thing in the same place from the same person in the same words a dozen times , but is paralysed with astonishment notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 7611 len. 6]: ` Dear me ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7612 len. 44]: I little thought the first time I saw him , Sir , ' says Kit , pleased with the attorney 's strong interest in his favourite , ` that I should come to be as intimate with him as I am now . '
Parsing [sent. 7613 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 7614 len. 14]: rejoins Mr Brass , brim-full of moral precepts and love of virtue . '
Parsing [sent. 7615 len. 11]: A charming subject of reflection for you , very charming .
Parsing [sent. 7616 len. 10]: A subject of proper pride and congratulation , Christopher .
Parsing [sent. 7617 len. 6]: Honesty is the best policy .
Parsing [sent. 7618 len. 8]: -- I always find it so myself .
Parsing [sent. 7619 len. 11]: I lost forty-seven pound ten by being honest this morning .
Parsing [sent. 7620 len. 11]: But it 's all gain , it 's gain ! '
Parsing [sent. 7621 len. 22]: Mr Brass slyly tickles his nose with his pen , and looks at Kit with the water standing in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7622 len. 22]: Kit thinks that if ever there was a good man who belied his appearance , that man is Sampson Brass . '
Parsing [sent. 7623 len. 27]: A man , ' says Sampson , ` who loses forty-seven pound ten in one morning by his honesty , is a man to be envied .
Parsing [sent. 7624 len. 16]: If it had been eighty pound , the luxuriousness of feeling would have been increased .
Parsing [sent. 7625 len. 13]: Every pound lost , would have been a hundredweight of happiness gained .
Parsing [sent. 7626 len. 36]: The still small voice , Christopher , ' cries Brass , smiling , and tapping himself on the bosom , ` is a-singing comic songs within me , and all is happiness and joy ! '
Parsing [sent. 7627 len. 33]: Kit is so improved by the conversation , and finds it go so completely home to his feelings , that he is considering what he shall say , when Mr Garland appears .
Parsing [sent. 7628 len. 86]: The old gentleman is helped into the chaise with great obsequiousness by Mr Sampson Brass ; and the pony , after shaking his head several times , and standing for three or four minutes with all his four legs planted firmly on the ground , as if he had made up his mind never to stir from that spot , but there to live and die , suddenly darts off , without the smallest notice , at the rate of twelve English miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 7629 len. 83]: Then , Mr Brass and his sister -LRB- who has joined him at the door -RRB- exchange an odd kind of smile -- not at all a pleasant one in its expression -- and return to the society of Mr Richard Swiveller , who , during their absence , has been regaling himself with various feats of pantomime , and is discovered at his desk , in a very flushed and heated condition , violently scratching out nothing with half a penknife .
Parsing [sent. 7630 len. 102]: Whenever Kit came alone , and without the chaise , it always happened that Sampson Brass was reminded of some mission , calling Mr Swiveller , if not to Peckham Rye again , at all events to some pretty distant place from Which he could not be expected to return for two or three hours , or in all probability a much longer period , as that gentleman was not , to say the truth , renowned for using great expedition on such occasions , but rather for protracting and spinning out the time to the very utmost limit of possibility .
Parsing [sent. 7631 len. 11]: Mr Swiveller out of sight , Miss Sally immediately withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 7632 len. 26]: Mr Brass would then set the office-door wide open , hum his old tune with great gaiety of heart , and smile seraphically as before .
Parsing [sent. 7633 len. 47]: Kit coming down-stairs would be called in ; entertained with some moral and agreeable conversation ; perhaps entreated to mind the office for an instant while Mr Brass stepped over the way ; and afterwards presented with one or two half-crowns as the case might be .
Parsing [sent. 7634 len. 77]: This occurred so often , that Kit , nothing doubting but that they came from the single gentleman who had already rewarded his mother with great liberality , could not enough admire his generosity ; and bought so many cheap presents for her , and for little Jacob , and for the baby , and for Barbara to boot , that one or other of them was having some new trifle every day of their lives .
Parsing [sent. 7635 len. 38]: While these acts and deeds were in progress in and out of the office of Sampson Brass , Richard Swiveller , being often left alone therein , began to find the time hang heavy on his hands .
Parsing [sent. 7636 len. 61]: For the better preservation of his cheerfulness therefore , and to prevent his faculties from rusting , he provided himself with a cribbage-board and pack of cards , and accustomed himself to play at cribbage with a dummy , for twenty , thirty , or sometimes even fifty thousand pounds aside , besides many hazardous bets to a considerable amount .
Parsing [sent. 7637 len. 82]: As these games were very silently conducted , notwithstanding the magnitude of the interests involved , Mr Swiveller began to think that on those evenings when Mr and Miss Brass were out -LRB- and they often went out now -RRB- he heard a kind of snorting or hard-breathing sound in the direction of the door , which it occurred to him , after some reflection , must proceed from the small servant , who always had a cold from damp living .
Parsing [sent. 7638 len. 49]: Looking intently that way one night , he plainly distinguished an eye gleaming and glistening at the keyhole ; and having now no doubt that his suspicions were correct , he stole softly to the door , and pounced upon her before she was aware of his approach .
Parsing [sent. 7639 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7640 len. 28]: I did n't mean any harm indeed , upon my word I did n't , ' cried the small servant , struggling like a much larger one .
Parsing [sent. 7641 len. 22]: ` It 's so very dull , down-stairs , Please do n't you tell upon me , please do n't . '
Parsing [sent. 7642 len. 6]: ` Tell upon you ! '
Parsing [sent. 7643 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 7644 len. 16]: ` Do you mean to say you were looking through the keyhole for company ? '
Parsing [sent. 7645 len. 15]: ` Yes , upon my word I was , ' replied the small servant .
Parsing [sent. 7646 len. 12]: ` How long have you been cooling your eye there ? '
Parsing [sent. 7647 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 7648 len. 17]: ` Oh ever since you first began to play them cards , and long before . '
Parsing [sent. 7649 len. 54]: Vague recollections of several fantastic exercises with which he had refreshed himself after the fatigues of business , and to all of which , no doubt , the small servant was a party , rather disconcerted Mr Swiveller ; but he was not very sensitive on such points , and recovered himself speedily .
Parsing [sent. 7650 len. 15]: ` Well -- come in ' -- he said , after a little consideration .
Parsing [sent. 7651 len. 16]: ` Here -- sit down , and I 'll teach you how to play . '
Parsing [sent. 7652 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7653 len. 30]: I durst n't do it , ' rejoined the small servant ; ` Miss Sally ` ud kill me , if she know 'd I come up here . '
Parsing [sent. 7654 len. 9]: ` Have you got a fire down-stairs ? '
Parsing [sent. 7655 len. 4]: said Dick . '
Parsing [sent. 7656 len. 11]: A very little one , ' replied the small servant .
Parsing [sent. 7657 len. 32]: ` Miss Sally could n't kill me if she know 'd I went down there , so I 'll come , ' said Richard , putting the cards into his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 7658 len. 8]: ` Why , how thin you are !
Parsing [sent. 7659 len. 8]: What do you mean by it ? '
Parsing [sent. 7660 len. 8]: ` It ai n't my fault . '
Parsing [sent. 7661 len. 10]: ` Could you eat any bread and meat ? '
Parsing [sent. 7662 len. 8]: said Dick , taking down his hat .
Parsing [sent. 7663 len. 3]: ` Yes ?
Parsing [sent. 7664 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7665 len. 4]: I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 7666 len. 8]: Did you ever taste beer ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7667 len. 14]: I had a sip of it once , ' said the small servant .
Parsing [sent. 7668 len. 9]: ` Here 's a state of things ! '
Parsing [sent. 7669 len. 11]: cried Mr Swiveller , raising his eyes to the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 7670 len. 15]: ` She never tasted it -- it ca n't be tasted in a sip !
Parsing [sent. 7671 len. 9]: Why , how old are you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7672 len. 6]: I do n't know . '
Parsing [sent. 7673 len. 31]: Mr Swiveller opened his eyes very wide , and appeared thoughtful for a moment ; then , bidding the child mind the door until he came back , vanished straightway .
Parsing [sent. 7674 len. 84]: Presently , he returned , followed by the boy from the public-house , who bore in one hand a plate of bread and beef , and in the other a great pot , filled with some very fragrant compound , which sent forth a grateful steam , and was indeed choice purl , made after a particular recipe which Mr Swiveller had imparted to the landlord , at a period when he was deep in his books and desirous to conciliate his friendship .
Parsing [sent. 7675 len. 30]: Relieving the boy of his burden at the door , and charging his little companion to fasten it to prevent surprise , Mr Swiveller followed her into the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 7676 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 7677 len. 9]: said Richard , putting the plate before her .
Parsing [sent. 7678 len. 18]: ` First of all clear that off , and then you 'll see what 's next . '
Parsing [sent. 7679 len. 15]: The small servant needed no second bidding , and the plate was soon empty .
Parsing [sent. 7680 len. 34]: ` Next , ' said Dick , handing the purl , ` take a pull at that ; but moderate your transports , you know , for you 're not used to it .
Parsing [sent. 7681 len. 7]: Well , is it good ? '
Parsing [sent. 7682 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7683 len. 5]: is n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 7684 len. 5]: said the small servant .
Parsing [sent. 7685 len. 27]: Mr Swiveller appeared gratified beyond all expression by this reply , and took a long draught himself , steadfastly regarding his companion while he did so .
Parsing [sent. 7686 len. 27]: These preliminaries disposed of , he applied himself to teaching her the game , which she soon learnt tolerably well , being both sharp-witted and cunning .
Parsing [sent. 7687 len. 36]: ` Now , ' said Mr Swiveller , putting two sixpences into a saucer , and trimming the wretched candle , when the cards had been cut and dealt , ` those are the stakes .
Parsing [sent. 7688 len. 9]: If you win , you get 'em all .
Parsing [sent. 7689 len. 8]: If I win , I get 'em .
Parsing [sent. 7690 len. 21]: To make it seem more real and pleasant , I shall call you the Marchioness , do you hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 7691 len. 5]: The small servant nodded .
Parsing [sent. 7692 len. 15]: ` Then , Marchioness , ' said Mr Swiveller , ` fire away ! '
Parsing [sent. 7693 len. 45]: The Marchioness , holding her cards very tight in both hands , considered which to play , and Mr Swiveller , assuming the gay and fashionable air which such society required , took another pull at the tankard , and waited for her lead .
Parsing [sent. 7694 len. 61]: Chapter 58 Mr Swiveller and his partner played several rubbers with varying success , until the loss of three sixpences , the gradual sinking of the purl , and the striking of ten o'clock , combined to render that gentleman mindful of the flight of Time , and the expediency of withdrawing before Mr Sampson and Miss Sally Brass returned .
Parsing [sent. 7695 len. 91]: ` With which object in view , Marchioness , ' said Mr Swiveller gravely , ' I shall ask your ladyship 's permission to put the board in my pocket , and to retire from the presence when I have finished this tankard ; merely observing , Marchioness , that since life like a river is flowing , I care not how fast it rolls on , ma'am , on , while such purl on the bank still is growing , and such eyes light the waves as they run .
Parsing [sent. 7696 len. 5]: Marchioness , your health .
Parsing [sent. 7697 len. 31]: You will excuse my wearing my hat , but the palace is damp , and the marble floor is -- if I may be allowed the expression -- sloppy . '
Parsing [sent. 7698 len. 45]: As a precaution against this latter inconvenience , Mr Swiveller had been sitting for some time with his feet on the hob , in which attitude he now gave utterance to these apologetic observations , and slowly sipped the last choice drops of nectar .
Parsing [sent. 7699 len. 20]: ` The Baron Sampsono Brasso and his fair sister are -LRB- you tell me -RRB- at the Play ? '
Parsing [sent. 7700 len. 29]: said Mr Swiveller , leaning his left arm heavily upon the table , and raising his voice and his right leg after the manner of a theatrical bandit .
Parsing [sent. 7701 len. 4]: The Marchioness nodded .
Parsing [sent. 7702 len. 4]: ` Ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 7703 len. 10]: said Mr Swiveller , with a portentous frown . ''
Parsing [sent. 7704 len. 3]: Tis well .
Parsing [sent. 7705 len. 2]: Marchioness !
Parsing [sent. 7706 len. 5]: -- but no matter .
Parsing [sent. 7707 len. 4]: Some wine there .
Parsing [sent. 7708 len. 3]: Ho ! '
Parsing [sent. 7709 len. 30]: He illustrated these melodramatic morsels by handing the tankard to himself with great humility , receiving it haughtily , drinking from it thirstily , and smacking his lips fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 7710 len. 104]: The small servant , who was not so well acquainted with theatrical conventionalities as Mr Swiveller -LRB- having indeed never seen a play , or heard one spoken of , except by chance through chinks of doors and in other forbidden places -RRB- , was rather alarmed by demonstrations so novel in their nature , and showed her concern so plainly in her looks , that Mr Swiveller felt it necessary to discharge his brigand manner for one more suitable to private life , as he asked , ` Do they often go where glory waits 'em , and leave you here ? '
Parsing [sent. 7711 len. 17]: ` Oh , yes ; I believe you they do , ' returned the small servant .
Parsing [sent. 7712 len. 14]: ` Miss Sally 's such a one-er for that , she is . '
Parsing [sent. 7713 len. 6]: ` Such a what ? '
Parsing [sent. 7714 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 7715 len. 10]: ` Such a one-er , ' returned the Marchioness .
Parsing [sent. 7716 len. 59]: After a moment 's reflection , Mr Swiveller determined to forego his responsible duty of setting her right , and to suffer her to talk on ; as it was evident that her tongue was loosened by the purl , and her opportunities for conversation were not so frequent as to render a momentary check of little consequence .
Parsing [sent. 7717 len. 31]: ` They sometimes go to see Mr Quilp , ' said the small servant with a shrewd look ; ` they go to a many places , bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 7718 len. 8]: ` Is Mr Brass a wunner ? '
Parsing [sent. 7719 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 7720 len. 22]: ` Not half what Miss Sally is , he is n't , ' replied the small servant , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 7721 len. 13]: ` Bless you , he 'd never do anything without her . '
Parsing [sent. 7722 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7723 len. 9]: He would n't , would n't he ? '
Parsing [sent. 7724 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 7725 len. 31]: ` Miss Sally keeps him in such order , ' said the small servant ; ` he always asks her advice , he does ; and he catches it sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 7726 len. 15]: Bless you , you would n't believe how much he catches it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7727 len. 37]: I suppose , ' said Dick , ` that they consult together , a good deal , and talk about a great many people -- about me for instance , sometimes , eh , Marchioness ? '
Parsing [sent. 7728 len. 5]: The Marchioness nodded amazingly .
Parsing [sent. 7729 len. 4]: ` Complimentary ? '
Parsing [sent. 7730 len. 4]: said Mr Swiveller .
Parsing [sent. 7731 len. 38]: The Marchioness changed the motion of her head , which had not yet left off nodding , and suddenly began to shake it from side to side , with a vehemence which threatened to dislocate her neck .
Parsing [sent. 7732 len. 4]: ` Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 7733 len. 3]: Dick muttered .
Parsing [sent. 7734 len. 29]: ` Would it be any breach of confidence , Marchioness , to relate what they say of the humble individual who has now the honour to -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 7735 len. 15]: ` Miss Sally says you 're a funny chap , ' replied his friend .
Parsing [sent. 7736 len. 16]: ` Well , Marchioness , ' said Mr Swiveller , ` that 's not uncomplimentary .
Parsing [sent. 7737 len. 13]: Merriment , Marchioness , is not a bad or a degrading quality .
Parsing [sent. 7738 len. 23]: Old King Cole was himself a merry old soul , if we may put any faith in the pages of history . '
Parsing [sent. 7739 len. 20]: ` But she says , ' pursued his companion , ` that you a n't to be trusted . '
Parsing [sent. 7740 len. 37]: ` Why , really Marchioness , ' said Mr Swiveller , thoughtfully ; ` several ladies and gentlemen -- not exactly professional persons , but tradespeople , ma'am , tradespeople -- have made the same remark .
Parsing [sent. 7741 len. 26]: The obscure citizen who keeps the hotel over the way , inclined strongly to that opinion to-night when I ordered him to prepare the banquet .
Parsing [sent. 7742 len. 50]: It 's a popular prejudice , Marchioness ; and yet I am sure I do n't know why , for I have been trusted in my time to a considerable amount , and I can safely say that I never forsook my trust until it deserted me -- never .
Parsing [sent. 7743 len. 12]: Mr Brass is of the same opinion , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 7744 len. 54]: His friend nodded again , with a cunning look which seemed to hint that Mr Brass held stronger opinions on the subject than his sister ; and seeming to recollect herself , added imploringly , ` But do n't you ever tell upon me , or I shall be beat to death . '
Parsing [sent. 7745 len. 44]: ` Marchioness , ' said Mr Swiveller , rising , ` the word of a gentleman is as good as his bond -- sometimes better , as in the present case , where his bond might prove but a doubtful sort of security .
Parsing [sent. 7746 len. 20]: I am your friend , and I hope we shall play many more rubbers together in this same saloon .
Parsing [sent. 7747 len. 59]: But , Marchioness , ' added Richard , stopping in his way to the door , and wheeling slowly round upon the small servant , who was following with the candle ; ` it occurs to me that you must be in the constant habit of airing your eye at keyholes , to know all this . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7748 len. 48]: I only wanted , ' replied the trembling Marchioness , ` to know where the key of the safe was hid ; that was all ; and I would n't have taken much , if I had found it -- only enough to squench my hunger . '
Parsing [sent. 7749 len. 9]: ` You did n't find it then ? '
Parsing [sent. 7750 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 7751 len. 14]: ` But of course you did n't , or you 'd be plumper .
Parsing [sent. 7752 len. 5]: Good night , Marchioness .
Parsing [sent. 7753 len. 30]: Fare thee well , and if for ever , then for ever fare thee well -- and put up the chain , Marchioness , in case of accidents . '
Parsing [sent. 7754 len. 60]: With this parting injunction , Mr Swiveller emerged from the house ; and feeling that he had by this time taken quite as much to drink as promised to be good for his constitution -LRB- purl being a rather strong and heady compound -RRB- , wisely resolved to betake himself to his lodgings , and to bed at once .
Parsing [sent. 7755 len. 53]: Homeward he went therefore ; and his apartments -LRB- for he still retained the plural fiction -RRB- being at no great distance from the office , he was soon seated in his own bed-chamber , where , having pulled off one boot and forgotten the other , he fell into deep cogitation .
Parsing [sent. 7756 len. 77]: ` This Marchioness , ' said Mr Swiveller , folding his arms , ` is a very extraordinary person -- surrounded by mysteries , ignorant of the taste of beer , unacquainted with her own name -LRB- which is less remarkable -RRB- , and taking a limited view of society through the keyholes of doors -- can these things be her destiny , or has some unknown person started an opposition to the decrees of fate ?
Parsing [sent. 7757 len. 10]: It is a most inscrutable and unmitigated staggerer ! '
Parsing [sent. 7758 len. 43]: When his meditations had attained this satisfactory point , he became aware of his remaining boot , of which , with unimpaired solemnity he proceeded to divest himself ; shaking his head with exceeding gravity all the time , and sighing deeply .
Parsing [sent. 7759 len. 32]: ` These rubbers , ' said Mr Swiveller , putting on his nightcap in exactly the same style as he wore his hat , ` remind me of the matrimonial fireside .
Parsing [sent. 7760 len. 9]: Cheggs 's wife plays cribbage ; all-fours likewise .
Parsing [sent. 7761 len. 8]: She rings the changes on 'em now .
Parsing [sent. 7762 len. 32]: From sport to sport they hurry her to banish her regrets , and when they win a smile from her , they think that she forgets -- but she do n't .
Parsing [sent. 7763 len. 53]: By this time , I should say , ' added Richard , getting his left cheek into profile , and looking complacently at the reflection of a very little scrap of whisker in the looking-glass ; ` by this time , I should say , the iron has entered into her soul .
Parsing [sent. 7764 len. 6]: It serves her right ! '
Parsing [sent. 7765 len. 54]: Melting from this stern and obdurate , into the tender and pathetic mood , Mr Swiveller groaned a little , walked wildly up and down , and even made a show of tearing his hair , which , however , he thought better of , and wrenched the tassel from his nightcap instead .
Parsing [sent. 7766 len. 15]: At last , undressing himself with a gloomy resolution , he got into bed .
Parsing [sent. 7767 len. 83]: Some men in his blighted position would have taken to drinking ; but as Mr Swiveller had taken to that before , he only took , on receiving the news that Sophy Wackles was lost to him for ever , to playing the flute ; thinking after mature consideration that it was a good , sound , dismal occupation , not only in unison with his own sad thoughts , but calculated to awaken a fellow-feeling in the bosoms of his neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 7768 len. 44]: In pursuance of this resolution , he now drew a little table to his bedside , and arranging the light and a small oblong music-book to the best advantage , took his flute from its box , and began to play most mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 7769 len. 65]: The air was ` Away with melancholy ' -- a composition , which , when it is played very slowly on the flute , in bed , with the further disadvantage of being performed by a gentleman but imperfectly acquainted with the instrument , who repeats one note a great many times before he can find the next , has not a lively effect .
Parsing [sent. 7770 len. 77]: Yet , for half the night , or more , Mr Swiveller , lying sometimes on his back with his eyes upon the ceiling , and sometimes half out of bed to correct himself by the book , played this unhappy tune over and over again ; never leaving off , save for a minute or two at a time to take breath and soliloquise about the Marchioness , and then beginning again with renewed vigour .
Parsing [sent. 7771 len. 82]: It was not until he had quite exhausted his several subjects of meditation , and had breathed into the flute the whole sentiment of the purl down to its very dregs , and had nearly maddened the people of the house , and at both the next doors , and over the way -- that he shut up the music-book , extinguished the candle , and finding himself greatly lightened and relieved in his mind , turned round and fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 7772 len. 81]: He awoke in the morning , much refreshed ; and having taken half an hour 's exercise at the flute , and graciously received a notice to quit from his landlady , who had been in waiting on the stairs for that purpose since the dawn of day , repaired to Bevis Marks ; where the beautiful Sally was already at her post , bearing in her looks a radiance , mild as that which beameth from the virgin moon .
Parsing [sent. 7773 len. 49]: Mr Swiveller acknowledged her presence by a nod , and exchanged his coat for the aquatic jacket ; which usually took some time fitting on , for in consequence of a tightness in the sleeves , it was only to be got into by a series of struggles .
Parsing [sent. 7774 len. 13]: This difficulty overcome , he took his seat at the desk . '
Parsing [sent. 7775 len. 28]: I say ' -- quoth Miss Brass , abruptly breaking silence , ` you have n't seen a silver pencil-case this morning , have you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7776 len. 15]: I did n't meet many in the street , ' rejoined Mr Swiveller . '
Parsing [sent. 7777 len. 44]: I saw one -- a stout pencil-case of respectable appearance -- but as he was in company with an elderly penknife , and a young toothpick with whom he was in earnest conversation , I felt a delicacy in speaking to him . '
Parsing [sent. 7778 len. 8]: ` No , but have you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7779 len. 4]: returned Miss Brass .
Parsing [sent. 7780 len. 7]: ` Seriously , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 7781 len. 21]: ` What a dull dog you must be to ask me such a question seriously , ' said Mr Swiveller .
Parsing [sent. 7782 len. 9]: ` Have n't I this moment come ? '
Parsing [sent. 7783 len. 40]: ` Well , all I know is , ' replied Miss Sally , ` that it 's not to be found , and that it disappeared one day this week , when I left it on the desk . '
Parsing [sent. 7784 len. 4]: ` Halloa ! '
Parsing [sent. 7785 len. 16]: thought Richard , ' I hope the Marchioness has n't been at work here . '
Parsing [sent. 7786 len. 18]: ` There was a knife too , ' said Miss Sally , ` of the same pattern .
Parsing [sent. 7787 len. 17]: They were given to me by my father , years ago , and are both gone .
Parsing [sent. 7788 len. 11]: You have n't missed anything yourself , have you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7789 len. 47]: Mr Swiveller involuntarily clapped his hands to the jacket to be quite sure that it WAS a jacket and not a skirted coat ; and having satisfied himself of the safety of this , his only moveable in Bevis Marks , made answer in the negative .
Parsing [sent. 7790 len. 76]: ` It 's a very unpleasant thing , Dick , ' said Miss Brass , pulling out the tin box and refreshing herself with a pinch of snuff ; ` but between you and me -- between friends you know , for if Sammy knew it , I should never hear the last of it -- some of the office-money , too , that has been left about , has gone in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 7791 len. 14]: In particular , I have missed three half-crowns at three different times . '
Parsing [sent. 7792 len. 8]: ` You do n't mean that ? '
Parsing [sent. 7793 len. 3]: cried Dick .
Parsing [sent. 7794 len. 17]: ` Be careful what you say , old boy , for this is a serious matter .
Parsing [sent. 7795 len. 5]: Are you quite sure ?
Parsing [sent. 7796 len. 6]: Is there no mistake ? '
Parsing [sent. 7797 len. 21]: ` It is so , and there ca n't be any mistake at all , ' rejoined Miss Brass emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 7798 len. 25]: ` Then by Jove , ' thought Richard , laying down his pen , ' I am afraid the Marchioness is done for ! '
Parsing [sent. 7799 len. 26]: The more he discussed the subject in his thoughts , the more probable it appeared to Dick that the miserable little servant was the culprit .
Parsing [sent. 7800 len. 38]: When he considered on what a spare allowance of food she lived , how neglected and untaught she was , and how her natural cunning had been sharpened by necessity and privation , he scarcely doubted it .
Parsing [sent. 7801 len. 50]: And yet he pitied her so much , and felt so unwilling to have a matter of such gravity disturbing the oddity of their acquaintance , that he thought , and thought truly , that rather than receive fifty pounds down , he would have the Marchioness proved innocent .
Parsing [sent. 7802 len. 60]: While he was plunged in very profound and serious meditation upon this theme , Miss Sally sat shaking her head with an air of great mystery and doubt ; when the voice of her brother Sampson , carolling a cheerful strain , was heard in the passage , and that gentleman himself , beaming with virtuous smiles , appeared .
Parsing [sent. 7803 len. 9]: ` Mr Richard , sir , good morning !
Parsing [sent. 7804 len. 28]: Here we are again , sir , entering upon another day , with our bodies strengthened by slumber and breakfast , and our spirits fresh and flowing .
Parsing [sent. 7805 len. 46]: Here we are , Mr Richard , rising with the sun to run our little course -- our course of duty , sir -- and , like him , to get through our day 's work with credit to ourselves and advantage to our fellow-creatures .
Parsing [sent. 7806 len. 9]: A charming reflection sir , very charming ! '
Parsing [sent. 7807 len. 41]: While he addressed his clerk in these words , Mr Brass was , somewhat ostentatiously , engaged in minutely examining and holding up against the light a five-pound bank note , which he had brought in , in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 7808 len. 29]: Mr Richard not receiving his remarks with anything like enthusiasm , his employer turned his eyes to his face , and observed that it wore a troubled expression .
Parsing [sent. 7809 len. 13]: ` You 're out of spirits , sir , ' said Brass .
Parsing [sent. 7810 len. 20]: ` Mr Richard , sir , we should fall to work cheerfully , and not in a despondent state .
Parsing [sent. 7811 len. 21]: It becomes us , Mr Richard , sir , to -- ' Here the chaste Sarah heaved a loud sigh .
Parsing [sent. 7812 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 7813 len. 8]: said Mr Sampson , ` you too !
Parsing [sent. 7814 len. 5]: Is anything the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 7815 len. 34]: Mr Richard , sir -- ' Dick , glancing at Miss Sally , saw that she was making signals to him , to acquaint her brother with the subject of their recent conversation .
Parsing [sent. 7816 len. 43]: As his own position was not a very pleasant one until the matter was set at rest one way or other , he did so ; and Miss Brass , plying her snuff-box at a most wasteful rate , corroborated his account .
Parsing [sent. 7817 len. 12]: The countenance of Sampson fell , and anxiety overspread his features .
Parsing [sent. 7818 len. 64]: Instead of passionately bewailing the loss of his money , as Miss Sally had expected , he walked on tiptoe to the door , opened it , looked outside , shut it softly , returned on tiptoe , and said in a whisper , ` This is a most extraordinary and painful circumstance -- Mr Richard , sir , a most painful circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 7819 len. 47]: The fact is , that I myself have missed several small sums from the desk , of late , and have refrained from mentioning it , hoping that accident would discover the offender ; but it has not done so -- it has not done so .
Parsing [sent. 7820 len. 15]: Sally -- Mr Richard , sir -- this is a particularly distressing affair ! '
Parsing [sent. 7821 len. 28]: As Sampson spoke , he laid the bank-note upon the desk among some papers , in an absent manner , and thrust his hands into his pockets .
Parsing [sent. 7822 len. 14]: Richard Swiveller pointed to it , and admonished him to take it up .
Parsing [sent. 7823 len. 22]: ` No , Mr Richard , sir , ' rejoined Brass with emotion , ' I will not take it up .
Parsing [sent. 7824 len. 9]: I will let it lie there , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7825 len. 28]: To take it up , Mr Richard , sir , would imply a doubt of you ; and in you , sir , I have unlimited confidence .
Parsing [sent. 7826 len. 25]: We will let it lie there , Sir , if you please , and we will not take it up by any means . '
Parsing [sent. 7827 len. 41]: With that , Mr Brass patted him twice or thrice on the shoulder , in a most friendly manner , and entreated him to believe that he had as much faith in his honesty as he had in his own .
Parsing [sent. 7828 len. 38]: Although at another time Mr Swiveller might have looked upon this as a doubtful compliment , he felt it , under the then-existing circumstances , a great relief to be assured that he was not wrongfully suspected .
Parsing [sent. 7829 len. 29]: When he had made a suitable reply , Mr Brass wrung him by the hand , and fell into a brown study , as did Miss Sally likewise .
Parsing [sent. 7830 len. 29]: Richard too remained in a thoughtful state ; fearing every moment to hear the Marchioness impeached , and unable to resist the conviction that she must be guilty .
Parsing [sent. 7831 len. 39]: When they had severally remained in this condition for some minutes , Miss Sally all at once gave a loud rap upon the desk with her clenched fist , and cried , ` I 've hit it ! '
Parsing [sent. 7832 len. 22]: -- as indeed she had , and chipped a piece out of it too ; but that was not her meaning .
Parsing [sent. 7833 len. 8]: ` Well , ' cried Brass anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 7834 len. 8]: ` Go on , will you ! '
Parsing [sent. 7835 len. 66]: ` Why , ' replied his sister with an air of triumph , ` has n't there been somebody always coming in and out of this office for the last three or four weeks ; has n't that somebody been left alone in it sometimes -- thanks to you ; and do you mean to tell me that that somebody is n't the thief ! '
Parsing [sent. 7836 len. 5]: ` What somebody ? '
Parsing [sent. 7837 len. 3]: blustered Brass .
Parsing [sent. 7838 len. 12]: ` Why , what do you call him -- Kit . '
Parsing [sent. 7839 len. 8]: ` Mr Garland 's young man ? '
Parsing [sent. 7840 len. 6]: ` To be sure . '
Parsing [sent. 7841 len. 4]: ` Never ! '
Parsing [sent. 7842 len. 3]: cried Brass .
Parsing [sent. 7843 len. 3]: ` Never .
Parsing [sent. 7844 len. 7]: I 'll not hear of it .
Parsing [sent. 7845 len. 29]: Do n't tell me ' -- said Sampson , shaking his head , and working with both his hands as if he were clearing away ten thousand cobwebs .
Parsing [sent. 7846 len. 9]: ` I 'll never believe it of him .
Parsing [sent. 7847 len. 4]: Never ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7848 len. 23]: I say , ' repeated Miss Brass , taking another pinch of snuff , ` that he 's the thief . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7849 len. 14]: I say , ' returned Sampson violently , ` that he is not .
Parsing [sent. 7850 len. 5]: What do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 7851 len. 4]: How dare you ?
Parsing [sent. 7852 len. 9]: Are characters to be whispered away like this ?
Parsing [sent. 7853 len. 24]: Do you know that he 's the honestest and faithfullest fellow that ever lived , and that he has an irreproachable good name ?
Parsing [sent. 7854 len. 7]: Come in , come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 7855 len. 28]: These last words were not addressed to Miss Sally , though they partook of the tone in which the indignant remonstrances that preceded them had been uttered .
Parsing [sent. 7856 len. 32]: They were addressed to some person who had knocked at the office-door ; and they had hardly passed the lips of Mr Brass , when this very Kit himself looked in .
Parsing [sent. 7857 len. 13]: ` Is the gentleman up-stairs , sir , if you please ? '
Parsing [sent. 7858 len. 32]: ` Yes , Kit , ' said Brass , still fired with an honest indignation , and frowning with knotted brows upon his sister ; ` Yes Kit , he is .
Parsing [sent. 7859 len. 15]: I am glad to see you Kit , I am rejoiced to see you .
Parsing [sent. 7860 len. 11]: Look in again , as you come down-stairs , Kit .
Parsing [sent. 7861 len. 6]: That lad a robber ! '
Parsing [sent. 7862 len. 15]: cried Brass when he had withdrawn , ` with that frank and open countenance !
Parsing [sent. 7863 len. 8]: I 'd trust him with untold gold .
Parsing [sent. 7864 len. 34]: Mr Richard , sir , have the goodness to step directly to Wrasp and Co. 's in Broad Street , and inquire if they have had instructions to appear in Carkem and Painter .
Parsing [sent. 7865 len. 16]: THAT lad a robber , ' sneered Sampson , flushed and heated with his wrath .
Parsing [sent. 7866 len. 23]: ` Am I blind , deaf , silly ; do I know nothing of human nature when I see it before me ?
Parsing [sent. 7867 len. 4]: Kit a robber !
Parsing [sent. 7868 len. 3]: Bah ! '
Parsing [sent. 7869 len. 42]: Flinging this final interjection at Miss Sally with immeasurable scorn and contempt , Sampson Brass thrust his head into his desk , as if to shut the base world from his view , and breathed defiance from under its half-closed lid .
Parsing [sent. 7870 len. 39]: Chapter 59 When Kit , having discharged his errand , came down-stairs from the single gentleman 's apartment after the lapse of a quarter of an hour or so , Mr Sampson Brass was alone in the office .
Parsing [sent. 7871 len. 15]: He was not singing as usual , nor was he seated at his desk .
Parsing [sent. 7872 len. 31]: The open door showed him standing before the fire with his back towards it , and looking so very strange that Kit supposed he must have been suddenly taken ill .
Parsing [sent. 7873 len. 9]: ` Is anything the matter , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 7874 len. 3]: said Kit .
Parsing [sent. 7875 len. 4]: ` Matter ! '
Parsing [sent. 7876 len. 3]: cried Brass .
Parsing [sent. 7877 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 7878 len. 6]: Why anything the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 7879 len. 21]: ` You are so very pale , ' said Kit , ` that I should hardly have known you . '
Parsing [sent. 7880 len. 4]: ` Pooh pooh !
Parsing [sent. 7881 len. 14]: mere fancy , ' cried Brass , stooping to throw up the cinders .
Parsing [sent. 7882 len. 13]: ` Never better , Kit , never better in all my life .
Parsing [sent. 7883 len. 3]: Merry too .
Parsing [sent. 7884 len. 3]: Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 7885 len. 10]: How 's our friend above-stairs , eh ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7886 len. 9]: A great deal better , ' said Kit .
Parsing [sent. 7887 len. 19]: ` I 'm glad to hear it , ' rejoined Brass ; ` thankful , I may say .
Parsing [sent. 7888 len. 19]: An excellent gentleman -- worthy , liberal , generous , gives very little trouble -- an admirable lodger .
Parsing [sent. 7889 len. 3]: Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 7890 len. 24]: Mr Garland -- he 's well I hope , Kit -- and the pony -- my friend , my particular friend you know .
Parsing [sent. 7891 len. 4]: Ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 7892 len. 14]: Kit gave a satisfactory account of all the little household at Abel Cottage .
Parsing [sent. 7893 len. 29]: Mr Brass , who seemed remarkably inattentive and impatient , mounted on his stool , and beckoning him to come nearer , took him by the button-hole . '
Parsing [sent. 7894 len. 34]: I have been thinking , Kit , ' said the lawyer , ` that I could throw some little emoluments in your mother 's way -- You have a mother , I think ?
Parsing [sent. 7895 len. 21]: If I recollect right , you told me -- ' ` Oh yes , Sir , yes certainly . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7896 len. 6]: A widow , I think ?
Parsing [sent. 7897 len. 6]: an industrious widow ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7898 len. 13]: A harder-working woman or a better mother never lived , Sir . '
Parsing [sent. 7899 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 7900 len. 3]: cried Brass .
Parsing [sent. 7901 len. 8]: ` That 's affecting , truly affecting .
Parsing [sent. 7902 len. 21]: A poor widow struggling to maintain her orphans in decency and comfort , is a delicious picture of human goodness .
Parsing [sent. 7903 len. 9]: -- Put down your hat , Kit . '
Parsing [sent. 7904 len. 12]: ` Thank you Sir , I must be going directly . '
Parsing [sent. 7905 len. 39]: ` Put it down while you stay , at any rate , ' said Brass , taking it from him and making some confusion among the papers , in finding a place for it on the desk . '
Parsing [sent. 7906 len. 26]: I was thinking , Kit , that we have often houses to let for people we are concerned for , and matters of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 7907 len. 29]: Now you know we 're obliged to put people into those houses to take care of 'em -- very often undeserving people that we ca n't depend upon .
Parsing [sent. 7908 len. 28]: What 's to prevent our having a person that we CAN depend upon , and enjoying the delight of doing a good action at the same time ?
Parsing [sent. 7909 len. 16]: I say , what 's to prevent our employing this worthy woman , your mother ?
Parsing [sent. 7910 len. 50]: What with one job and another , there 's lodging -- and good lodging too -- pretty well all the year round , rent free , and a weekly allowance besides , Kit , that would provide her with a great many comforts she do n't at present enjoy .
Parsing [sent. 7911 len. 8]: Now what do you think of that ?
Parsing [sent. 7912 len. 6]: Do you see any objection ?
Parsing [sent. 7913 len. 20]: My only desire is to serve you , Kit ; therefore if you do , say so freely . '
Parsing [sent. 7914 len. 26]: As Brass spoke , he moved the hat twice or thrice , and shuffled among the papers again , as if in search of something .
Parsing [sent. 7915 len. 16]: ` How can I see any objection to such a kind offer , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 7916 len. 8]: replied Kit with his whole heart . '
Parsing [sent. 7917 len. 16]: I do n't know how to thank you sir , I do n't indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 7918 len. 44]: ` Why then , ' said Brass , suddenly turning upon him and thrusting his face close to Kit 's with such a repulsive smile that the latter , even in the very height of his gratitude , drew back , quite startled .
Parsing [sent. 7919 len. 9]: ` Why then , it 's done . '
Parsing [sent. 7920 len. 8]: Kit looked at him in some confusion .
Parsing [sent. 7921 len. 23]: ` Done , I say , ' added Sampson , rubbing his hands and veiling himself again in his usual oily manner .
Parsing [sent. 7922 len. 4]: ` Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 7923 len. 12]: and so you shall find Kit , so you shall find .
Parsing [sent. 7924 len. 17]: But dear me , ' said Brass , ` what a time Mr Richard is gone !
Parsing [sent. 7925 len. 7]: A sad loiterer to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 7926 len. 13]: Will you mind the office one minute , while I run up-stairs ?
Parsing [sent. 7927 len. 4]: Only one minute .
Parsing [sent. 7928 len. 16]: I 'll not detain you an instant longer , on any account , Kit . '
Parsing [sent. 7929 len. 21]: Talking as he went , Mr Brass bustled out of the office , and in a very short time returned .
Parsing [sent. 7930 len. 36]: Mr Swiveller came back , almost at the same instant ; and as Kit was leaving the room hastily , to make up for lost time , Miss Brass herself encountered him in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 7931 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 7932 len. 10]: sneered Sally , looking after him as she entered .
Parsing [sent. 7933 len. 11]: ` There goes your pet , Sammy , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 7934 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7935 len. 8]: There he goes , ' replied Brass .
Parsing [sent. 7936 len. 8]: ` My pet , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 7937 len. 15]: An honest fellow , Mr Richard , sir -- a worthy fellow indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 7938 len. 4]: ` Hem ! '
Parsing [sent. 7939 len. 5]: coughed Miss Brass . '
Parsing [sent. 7940 len. 25]: I tell you , you aggravating vagabond , ' said the angry Sampson , ` that I 'd stake my life upon his honesty .
Parsing [sent. 7941 len. 10]: Am I never to hear the last of this ?
Parsing [sent. 7942 len. 15]: Am I always to be baited , and beset , by your mean suspicions ?
Parsing [sent. 7943 len. 12]: Have you no regard for true merit , you malignant fellow ?
Parsing [sent. 7944 len. 16]: If you come to that , I 'd sooner suspect your honesty than his . '
Parsing [sent. 7945 len. 27]: Miss Sally pulled out the tin snuff-box , and took a long , slow pinch , regarding her brother with a steady gaze all the time .
Parsing [sent. 7946 len. 23]: ` She drives me wild , Mr Richard , sir , ' said Brass , ` she exasperates me beyond all bearing .
Parsing [sent. 7947 len. 13]: I am heated and excited , sir , I know I am .
Parsing [sent. 7948 len. 21]: These are not business manners , sir , nor business looks , but she carries me out of myself . '
Parsing [sent. 7949 len. 10]: ` Why do n't you leave him alone ? '
Parsing [sent. 7950 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 7951 len. 47]: ` Because she ca n't , sir , ' retorted Brass ; ` because to chafe and vex me is a part of her nature , Sir , and she will and must do it , or I do n't believe she 'd have her health .
Parsing [sent. 7952 len. 12]: But never mind , ' said Brass , ` never mind .
Parsing [sent. 7953 len. 6]: I 've carried my point .
Parsing [sent. 7954 len. 9]: I 've shown my confidence in the lad .
Parsing [sent. 7955 len. 7]: He has minded the office again .
Parsing [sent. 7956 len. 3]: Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 7957 len. 6]: Ugh , you viper ! '
Parsing [sent. 7958 len. 24]: The beautiful virgin took another pinch , and put the snuff-box in her pocket ; still looking at her brother with perfect composure .
Parsing [sent. 7959 len. 44]: ` He has minded the office again , ' said Brass triumphantly ; ` he has had my confidence , and he shall continue to have it ; he -- why , where 's the -- ' ` What have you lost ? '
Parsing [sent. 7960 len. 4]: inquired Mr Swiveller .
Parsing [sent. 7961 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 7962 len. 53]: said Brass , slapping all his pockets , one after another , and looking into his desk , and under it , and upon it , and wildly tossing the papers about , ` the note , Mr Richard , sir , the five-pound note -- what can have become of it ?
Parsing [sent. 7963 len. 11]: I laid it down here -- God bless me ! '
Parsing [sent. 7964 len. 4]: ` What ! '
Parsing [sent. 7965 len. 19]: cried Miss Sally , starting up , clapping her hands , and scattering the papers on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 7966 len. 3]: ` Gone !
Parsing [sent. 7967 len. 5]: Now who 's right ?
Parsing [sent. 7968 len. 6]: Now who 's got it ?
Parsing [sent. 7969 len. 10]: Never mind five pounds -- what 's five pounds ?
Parsing [sent. 7970 len. 10]: He 's honest , you know , quite honest .
Parsing [sent. 7971 len. 8]: It would be mean to suspect him .
Parsing [sent. 7972 len. 6]: Do n't run after him .
Parsing [sent. 7973 len. 10]: No , no , not for the world ! '
Parsing [sent. 7974 len. 8]: ` Is it really gone though ? '
Parsing [sent. 7975 len. 15]: said Dick , looking at Brass with a face as pale as his own .
Parsing [sent. 7976 len. 36]: ` Upon my word , Mr Richard , Sir , ' replied the lawyer , feeling in all his pockets with looks of the greatest agitation , ' I fear this is a black business .
Parsing [sent. 7977 len. 7]: It 's certainly gone , Sir .
Parsing [sent. 7978 len. 7]: What 's to be done ? '
Parsing [sent. 7979 len. 16]: ` Do n't run after him , ' said Miss Sally , taking more snuff .
Parsing [sent. 7980 len. 10]: ` Do n't run after him on any account .
Parsing [sent. 7981 len. 12]: Give him time to get rid of it , you know .
Parsing [sent. 7982 len. 10]: It would be cruel to find him out ! '
Parsing [sent. 7983 len. 62]: Mr Swiveller and Sampson Brass looked from Miss Sally to each other , in a state of bewilderment , and then , as by one impulse , caught up their hats and rushed out into the street -- darting along in the middle of the road , and dashing aside all obstructions , as though they were running for their lives .
Parsing [sent. 7984 len. 31]: It happened that Kit had been running too , though not so fast , and having the start of them by some few minutes , was a good distance ahead .
Parsing [sent. 7985 len. 47]: As they were pretty certain of the road he must have taken , however , and kept on at a great pace , they came up with him , at the very moment when he had taken breath , and was breaking into a run again .
Parsing [sent. 7986 len. 4]: ` Stop ! '
Parsing [sent. 7987 len. 18]: cried Sampson , laying his hand on one shoulder , while Mr Swiveller pounced upon the other .
Parsing [sent. 7988 len. 6]: ` Not so fast sir .
Parsing [sent. 7989 len. 7]: You 're in a hurry ? '
Parsing [sent. 7990 len. 20]: ` Yes , I am , ' said Kit , looking from one to the other in great surprise .
Parsing [sent. 7991 len. 25]: ` I -- I -- can hardly believe it , ' panted Sampson , ` but something of value is missing from the office .
Parsing [sent. 7992 len. 9]: I hope you do n't know what . '
Parsing [sent. 7993 len. 4]: ` Know what !
Parsing [sent. 7994 len. 7]: good Heaven , Mr Brass ! '
Parsing [sent. 7995 len. 33]: cried Kit , trembling from head to foot ; ` you do n't suppose -- ' ` No , no , ' rejoined Brass quickly , ' I do n't suppose anything .
Parsing [sent. 7996 len. 8]: Do n't say I said you did .
Parsing [sent. 7997 len. 10]: You 'll come back quietly , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 7998 len. 10]: ` Of course I will , ' returned Kit .
Parsing [sent. 7999 len. 5]: ` Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 8000 len. 6]: ` To be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 8001 len. 3]: said Brass .
Parsing [sent. 8002 len. 4]: ` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 8003 len. 12]: I hope there may turn out to be no why not .
Parsing [sent. 8004 len. 28]: If you knew the trouble I 've been in , this morning , through taking your part , Christopher , you 'd be sorry for it . '
Parsing [sent. 8005 len. 19]: ` And I am sure you 'll be sorry for having suspected me sir , ' replied Kit .
Parsing [sent. 8006 len. 3]: ` Come .
Parsing [sent. 8007 len. 7]: Let us make haste back . '
Parsing [sent. 8008 len. 4]: ` Certainly ! '
Parsing [sent. 8009 len. 10]: cried Brass , ` the quicker , the better .
Parsing [sent. 8010 len. 14]: Mr Richard -- have the goodness , sir , to take that arm .
Parsing [sent. 8011 len. 6]: I 'll take this one .
Parsing [sent. 8012 len. 27]: It 's not easy walking three abreast , but under these circumstances it must be done , sir ; there 's no help for it . '
Parsing [sent. 8013 len. 30]: Kit did turn from white to red , and from red to white again , when they secured him thus , and for a moment seemed disposed to resist .
Parsing [sent. 8014 len. 60]: But , quickly recollecting himself , and remembering that if he made any struggle , he would perhaps be dragged by the collar through the public streets , he only repeated , with great earnestness and with the tears standing in his eyes , that they would be sorry for this -- and suffered them to lead him off .
Parsing [sent. 8015 len. 116]: While they were on the way back , Mr Swiveller , upon whom his present functions sat very irksomely , took an opportunity of whispering in his ear that if he would confess his guilt , even by so much as a nod , and promise not to do so any more , he would connive at his kicking Sampson Brass on the shins and escaping up a court ; but Kit indignantly rejecting this proposal , Mr Richard had nothing for it , but to hold him tight until they reached Bevis Marks , and ushered him into the presence of the charming Sarah , who immediately took the precaution of locking the door .
Parsing [sent. 8016 len. 40]: ` Now , you know , ' said Brass , ` if this is a case of innocence , it is a case of that description , Christopher , where the fullest disclosure is the best satisfaction for everybody .
Parsing [sent. 8017 len. 41]: Therefore if you 'll consent to an examination , ' he demonstrated what kind of examination he meant by turning back the cuffs of his coat , ` it will be a comfortable and pleasant thing for all parties . '
Parsing [sent. 8018 len. 14]: ` Search me , ' said Kit , proudly holding up his arms .
Parsing [sent. 8019 len. 24]: ` But mind , sir -- I know you 'll be sorry for this , to the last day of your life . '
Parsing [sent. 8020 len. 40]: ` It is certainly a very painful occurrence , ' said Brass with a sigh , as he dived into one of Kit 's pockets , and fished up a miscellaneous collection of small articles ; ` very painful .
Parsing [sent. 8021 len. 12]: Nothing here , Mr Richard , Sir , all perfectly satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 8022 len. 5]: Nor here , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8023 len. 14]: Nor in the waistcoat , Mr Richard , nor in the coat tails .
Parsing [sent. 8024 len. 12]: So far , I am rejoiced , I am sure . '
Parsing [sent. 8025 len. 76]: Richard Swiveller , holding Kit 's hat in his hand , was watching the proceedings with great interest , and bore upon his face the slightest possible indication of a smile , as Brass , shutting one of his eyes , looked with the other up the inside of one of the poor fellow 's sleeves as if it were a telescope -- when Sampson turning hastily to him , bade him search the hat .
Parsing [sent. 8026 len. 10]: ` Here 's a handkerchief , ' said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 8027 len. 35]: ` No harm in that sir , ' rejoined Brass , applying his eye to the other sleeve , and speaking in the voice of one who was contemplating an immense extent of prospect .
Parsing [sent. 8028 len. 10]: ` No harm in a handkerchief Sir , whatever .
Parsing [sent. 8029 len. 57]: The faculty do n't consider it a healthy custom , I believe , Mr Richard , to carry one 's handkerchief in one 's hat -- I have heard that it keeps the head too warm -- but in every other point of view , its being there , is extremely satisfactory -- extremely so . '
Parsing [sent. 8030 len. 21]: An exclamation , at once from Richard Swiveller , Miss Sally , and Kit himself , cut the lawyer short .
Parsing [sent. 8031 len. 16]: He turned his head , and saw Dick standing with the bank-note in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 8032 len. 6]: ` In the hat ? '
Parsing [sent. 8033 len. 8]: cried Brass in a sort of shriek .
Parsing [sent. 8034 len. 20]: ` Under the handkerchief , and tucked beneath the lining , ' said Dick , aghast at the discovery .
Parsing [sent. 8035 len. 34]: Mr Brass looked at him , at his sister , at the walls , at the ceiling , at the floor -- everywhere but at Kit , who stood quite stupefied and motionless .
Parsing [sent. 8036 len. 41]: ` And this , ' cried Sampson , clasping his hands , ` is the world that turns upon its own axis , and has Lunar influences , and revolutions round Heavenly Bodies , and various games of that sort !
Parsing [sent. 8037 len. 8]: This is human natur , is it !
Parsing [sent. 8038 len. 5]: Oh natur , natur !
Parsing [sent. 8039 len. 36]: This is the miscreant that I was going to benefit with all my little arts , and that , even now , I feel so much for , as to wish to let him go !
Parsing [sent. 8040 len. 34]: But , ' added Mr Brass with greater fortitude , ' I am myself a lawyer , and bound to set an example in carrying the laws of my happy country into effect .
Parsing [sent. 8041 len. 17]: Sally my dear , forgive me , and catch hold of him on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 8042 len. 15]: Mr Richard , sir , have the goodness to run and fetch a constable .
Parsing [sent. 8043 len. 13]: The weakness is past and over sir , and moral strength returns .
Parsing [sent. 8044 len. 10]: A constable , sir , if you please ! '
Parsing [sent. 8045 len. 112]: Chapter 60 Kit stood as one entranced , with his eyes opened wide and fixed upon the ground , regardless alike of the tremulous hold which Mr Brass maintained on one side of his cravat , and of the firmer grasp of Miss Sally upon the other ; although this latter detention was in itself no small inconvenience , as that fascinating woman , besides screwing her knuckles inconveniently into his throat from time to time , had fastened upon him in the first instance with so tight a grip that even in the disorder and distraction of his thoughts he could not divest himself of an uneasy sense of choking .
Parsing [sent. 8046 len. 29]: Between the brother and sister he remained in this posture , quite unresisting and passive , until Mr Swiveller returned , with a police constable at his heels .
Parsing [sent. 8047 len. 128]: This functionary , being , of course , well used to such scenes ; looking upon all kinds of robbery , from petty larceny up to housebreaking or ventures on the highway , as matters in the regular course of business ; and regarding the perpetrators in the light of so many customers coming to be served at the wholesale and retail shop of criminal law where he stood behind the counter ; received Mr Brass 's statement of facts with about as much interest and surprise , as an undertaker might evince if required to listen to a circumstantial account of the last illness of a person whom he was called in to wait upon professionally ; and took Kit into custody with a decent indifference .
Parsing [sent. 8048 len. 25]: ` We had better , ' said this subordinate minister of justice , ` get to the office while there 's a magistrate sitting .
Parsing [sent. 8049 len. 39]: I shall want you to come along with us , Mr Brass , and the -- ' he looked at Miss Sally as if in some doubt whether she might not be a griffin or other fabulous monster .
Parsing [sent. 8050 len. 7]: ` The lady , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 8051 len. 3]: said Sampson .
Parsing [sent. 8052 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 8053 len. 4]: replied the constable .
Parsing [sent. 8054 len. 6]: ` Yes -- the lady .
Parsing [sent. 8055 len. 10]: Likewise the young man that found the property . '
Parsing [sent. 8056 len. 15]: ` Mr Richard , Sir , ' said Brass in a mournful voice . '
Parsing [sent. 8057 len. 4]: A sad necessity .
Parsing [sent. 8058 len. 20]: But the altar of our country sir -- ' ` You 'll have a hackney-coach , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 8059 len. 25]: interrupted the constable , holding Kit -LRB- whom his other captors had released -RRB- carelessly by the arm , a little above the elbow .
Parsing [sent. 8060 len. 13]: ` Be so good as send for one , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8061 len. 22]: ` But , hear me speak a word , ' cried Kit , raising his eyes and looking imploringly about him .
Parsing [sent. 8062 len. 7]: ` Hear me speak a word .
Parsing [sent. 8063 len. 11]: I am no more guilty than any one of you .
Parsing [sent. 8064 len. 7]: Upon my soul I am not .
Parsing [sent. 8065 len. 4]: I a thief !
Parsing [sent. 8066 len. 10]: Oh , Mr Brass , you know me better .
Parsing [sent. 8067 len. 8]: I am sure you know me better .
Parsing [sent. 8068 len. 11]: This is not right of you , indeed . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8069 len. 12]: I give you my word , constable -- ' said Brass .
Parsing [sent. 8070 len. 36]: But here the constable interposed with the constitutional principle ` words be blowed ; ' observing that words were but spoon-meat for babes and sucklings , and that oaths were the food for strong men .
Parsing [sent. 8071 len. 15]: ` Quite true , constable , ' assented Brass in the same mournful tone .
Parsing [sent. 8072 len. 4]: ` Strictly correct .
Parsing [sent. 8073 len. 55]: I give you my oath , constable , that down to a few minutes ago , when this fatal discovery was made , I had such confidence in that lad , that I 'd have trusted him with -- a hackney-coach , Mr Richard , sir ; you 're very slow , Sir . '
Parsing [sent. 8074 len. 23]: ` Who is there that knows me , ' cried Kit , ` that would not trust me -- that does not ?
Parsing [sent. 8075 len. 19]: ask anybody whether they have ever doubted me ; whether I have ever wronged them of a farthing .
Parsing [sent. 8076 len. 21]: Was I ever once dishonest when I was poor and hungry , and is it likely I would begin now !
Parsing [sent. 8077 len. 6]: Oh consider what you do .
Parsing [sent. 8078 len. 21]: How can I meet the kindest friends that ever human creature had , with this dreadful charge upon me ! '
Parsing [sent. 8079 len. 60]: Mr Brass rejoined that it would have been well for the prisoner if he had thought of that , before , and was about to make some other gloomy observations when the voice of the single gentleman was heard , demanding from above-stairs what was the matter , and what was the cause of all that noise and hurry .
Parsing [sent. 8080 len. 43]: Kit made an involuntary start towards the door in his anxiety to answer for himself , but being speedily detained by the constable , had the agony of seeing Sampson Brass run out alone to tell the story in his own way .
Parsing [sent. 8081 len. 23]: ` And he can hardly believe it , either , ' said Sampson , when he returned , ` nor nobody will .
Parsing [sent. 8082 len. 17]: I wish I could doubt the evidence of my senses , but their depositions are unimpeachable .
Parsing [sent. 8083 len. 29]: It 's of no use cross-examining my eyes , ' cried Sampson , winking and rubbing them , ` they stick to their first account , and will .
Parsing [sent. 8084 len. 23]: Now , Sarah , I hear the coach in the Marks ; get on your bonnet , and we 'll be off .
Parsing [sent. 8085 len. 4]: A sad errand !
Parsing [sent. 8086 len. 7]: a moral funeral , quite ! '
Parsing [sent. 8087 len. 8]: ` Mr Brass , ' said Kit .
Parsing [sent. 8088 len. 6]: ` do me one favour .
Parsing [sent. 8089 len. 9]: Take me to Mr Witherden 's first . '
Parsing [sent. 8090 len. 6]: Sampson shook his head irresolutely .
Parsing [sent. 8091 len. 7]: ` Do , ' said Kit .
Parsing [sent. 8092 len. 6]: ` My master 's there .
Parsing [sent. 8093 len. 12]: For Heaven 's sake , take me there , first . '
Parsing [sent. 8094 len. 32]: ` Well , I do n't know , ' stammered Brass , who perhaps had his reasons for wishing to show as fair as possible in the eyes of the notary .
Parsing [sent. 8095 len. 15]: ` How do we stand in point of time , constable , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 8096 len. 69]: The constable , who had been chewing a straw all this while with great philosophy , replied that if they went away at once they would have time enough , but that if they stood shilly-shallying there , any longer , they must go straight to the Mansion House ; and finally expressed his opinion that that was where it was , and that was all about it .
Parsing [sent. 8097 len. 41]: Mr Richard Swiveller having arrived inside the coach , and still remaining immoveable in the most commodious corner with his face to the horses , Mr Brass instructed the officer to remove his prisoner , and declared himself quite ready .
Parsing [sent. 8098 len. 54]: Therefore , the constable , still holding Kit in the same manner , and pushing him on a little before him , so as to keep him at about three-quarters of an arm 's length in advance -LRB- which is the professional mode -RRB- , thrust him into the vehicle and followed himself .
Parsing [sent. 8099 len. 26]: Miss Sally entered next ; and there being now four inside , Sampson Brass got upon the box , and made the coachman drive on .
Parsing [sent. 8100 len. 49]: Still completely stunned by the sudden and terrible change which had taken place in his affairs , Kit sat gazing out of the coach window , almost hoping to see some monstrous phenomenon in the streets which might give him reason to believe he was in a dream .
Parsing [sent. 8101 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 8102 len. 67]: Everything was too real and familiar : the same succession of turnings , the same houses , the same streams of people running side by side in different directions upon the pavement , the same bustle of carts and carriages in the road , the same well-remembered objects in the shop windows : a regularity in the very noise and hurry which no dream ever mirrored .
Parsing [sent. 8103 len. 10]: Dream-like as the story was , it was true .
Parsing [sent. 8104 len. 33]: He stood charged with robbery ; the note had been found upon him , though he was innocent in thought and deed ; and they were carrying him back , a prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 8105 len. 101]: Absorbed in these painful ruminations , thinking with a drooping heart of his mother and little Jacob , feeling as though even the consciousness of innocence would be insufficient to support him in the presence of his friends if they believed him guilty , and sinking in hope and courage more and more as they drew nearer to the notary 's , poor Kit was looking earnestly out of the window , observant of nothing , -- when all at once , as though it had been conjured up by magic , he became aware of the face of Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 8106 len. 10]: And what a leer there was upon the face !
Parsing [sent. 8107 len. 63]: It was from the open window of a tavern that it looked out ; and the dwarf had so spread himself over it , with his elbows on the window-sill and his head resting on both his hands , that what between this attitude and his being swoln with suppressed laughter , he looked puffed and bloated into twice his usual breadth .
Parsing [sent. 8108 len. 12]: Mr Brass , on recognising him , immediately stopped the coach .
Parsing [sent. 8109 len. 31]: As it came to a halt directly opposite to where he stood , the dwarf pulled off his hat , and saluted the party with a hideous and grotesque politeness .
Parsing [sent. 8110 len. 4]: ` Aha ! '
Parsing [sent. 8111 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 8112 len. 6]: ` Where now , Brass ?
Parsing [sent. 8113 len. 3]: where now ?
Parsing [sent. 8114 len. 5]: Sally with you too ?
Parsing [sent. 8115 len. 3]: Sweet Sally !
Parsing [sent. 8116 len. 3]: And Dick ?
Parsing [sent. 8117 len. 3]: Pleasant Dick !
Parsing [sent. 8118 len. 3]: And Kit !
Parsing [sent. 8119 len. 4]: Honest Kit ! '
Parsing [sent. 8120 len. 7]: ` He 's extremely cheerful ! '
Parsing [sent. 8121 len. 6]: said Brass to the coachman .
Parsing [sent. 8122 len. 5]: ` Very much so !
Parsing [sent. 8123 len. 8]: Ah , sir -- a sad business !
Parsing [sent. 8124 len. 10]: Never believe in honesty any more , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 8125 len. 5]: ` Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 8126 len. 4]: returned the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 8127 len. 14]: ` Why not , you rogue of a lawyer , why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 8128 len. 16]: ` Bank-note lost in our office sir , ' said Brass , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 8129 len. 30]: ` Found in his hat sir -- he previously left alone there -- no mistake at all sir -- chain of evidence complete -- not a link wanting . '
Parsing [sent. 8130 len. 4]: ` What ! '
Parsing [sent. 8131 len. 12]: cried the dwarf , leaning half his body out of window .
Parsing [sent. 8132 len. 5]: ` Kit a thief !
Parsing [sent. 8133 len. 4]: Kit a thief !
Parsing [sent. 8134 len. 4]: Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 8135 len. 16]: Why , he 's an uglier-looking thief than can be seen anywhere for a penny .
Parsing [sent. 8136 len. 6]: Eh , Kit -- eh ?
Parsing [sent. 8137 len. 4]: Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 8138 len. 16]: Have you taken Kit into custody before he had time and opportunity to beat me !
Parsing [sent. 8139 len. 7]: Eh , Kit , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 8140 len. 47]: And with that , he burst into a yell of laughter , manifestly to the great terror of the coachman , and pointed to a dyer 's pole hard by , where a dangling suit of clothes bore some resemblance to a man upon a gibbet .
Parsing [sent. 8141 len. 10]: ` Is it coming to that , Kit ! '
Parsing [sent. 8142 len. 9]: cried the dwarf , rubbing his hands violently .
Parsing [sent. 8143 len. 6]: ` Ha ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 8144 len. 13]: What a disappointment for little Jacob , and for his darling mother !
Parsing [sent. 8145 len. 14]: Let him have the Bethel minister to comfort and console him , Brass .
Parsing [sent. 8146 len. 6]: Eh , Kit , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 8147 len. 7]: Drive on coachey , drive on .
Parsing [sent. 8148 len. 29]: Bye bye , Kit ; all good go with you ; keep up your spirits ; my love to the Garlands -- the dear old lady and gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 8149 len. 9]: Say I inquired after 'em , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 8150 len. 13]: Blessings on 'em , on you , and on everybody , Kit .
Parsing [sent. 8151 len. 7]: Blessings on all the world ! '
Parsing [sent. 8152 len. 52]: With such good wishes and farewells , poured out in a rapid torrent until they were out of hearing , Quilp suffered them to depart ; and when he could see the coach no longer , drew in his head , and rolled upon the ground in an ecstacy of enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 8153 len. 76]: When they reached the notary 's , which they were not long in doing , for they had encountered the dwarf in a bye street at a very little distance from the house , Mr Brass dismounted ; and opening the coach door with a melancholy visage , requested his sister to accompany him into the office , with the view of preparing the good people within , for the mournful intelligence that awaited them .
Parsing [sent. 8154 len. 12]: Miss Sally complying , he desired Mr Swiveller to accompany them .
Parsing [sent. 8155 len. 22]: So , into the office they went ; Mr Sampson and his sister arm-in-arm ; and Mr Swiveller following , alone .
Parsing [sent. 8156 len. 46]: The notary was standing before the fire in the outer office , talking to Mr Abel and the elder Mr Garland , while Mr Chuckster sat writing at the desk , picking up such crumbs of their conversation as happened to fall in his way .
Parsing [sent. 8157 len. 41]: This posture of affairs Mr Brass observed through the glass-door as he was turning the handle , and seeing that the notary recognised him , he began to shake his head and sigh deeply while that partition yet divided them .
Parsing [sent. 8158 len. 37]: ` Sir , ' said Sampson , taking off his hat , and kissing the two fore-fingers of his right hand beaver glove , ` my name is Brass -- Brass of Bevis Marks , Sir .
Parsing [sent. 8159 len. 21]: I have had the honour and pleasure , Sir , of being concerned against you in some little testamentary matters .
Parsing [sent. 8160 len. 8]: How do you do , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8161 len. 25]: ` My clerk will attend to any business you may have come upon , Mr Brass , ' said the notary , turning away .
Parsing [sent. 8162 len. 17]: ` Thank you Sir , ' said Brass , ` thank you , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 8163 len. 34]: Allow me , Sir , to introduce my sister -- quite one of us Sir , although of the weaker sex -- of great use in my business Sir , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 8164 len. 71]: Mr Richard , sir , have the goodness to come foward if you please -- No really , ' said Brass , stepping between the notary and his private office -LRB- towards which he had begun to retreat -RRB- , and speaking in the tone of an injured man , ` really Sir , I must , under favour , request a word or two with you , indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 8165 len. 19]: ` Mr Brass , ' said the other , in a decided tone , ' I am engaged .
Parsing [sent. 8166 len. 10]: You see that I am occupied with these gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 8167 len. 18]: If you will communicate your business to Mr Chuckster yonder , you will receive every attention . '
Parsing [sent. 8168 len. 46]: ` Gentlemen , ' said Brass , laying his right hand on his waistcoat , and looking towards the father and son with a smooth smile -- ` Gentlemen , I appeal to you -- really , gentlemen -- consider , I beg of you .
Parsing [sent. 8169 len. 6]: I am of the law .
Parsing [sent. 8170 len. 11]: I am styled `` gentleman '' by Act of Parliament .
Parsing [sent. 8171 len. 16]: I maintain the title by the annual payment of twelve pound sterling for a certificate .
Parsing [sent. 8172 len. 36]: I am not one of your players of music , stage actors , writers of books , or painters of pictures , who assume a station that the laws of their country do n't recognise .
Parsing [sent. 8173 len. 9]: I am none of your strollers or vagabonds .
Parsing [sent. 8174 len. 25]: If any man brings his action against me , he must describe me as a gentleman , or his action is null and void .
Parsing [sent. 8175 len. 10]: I appeal to you -- is this quite respectful ?
Parsing [sent. 8176 len. 22]: Really gentlemen -- ' ` Well , will you have the goodness to state your business then , Mr Brass ? '
Parsing [sent. 8177 len. 4]: said the notary .
Parsing [sent. 8178 len. 11]: ` Sir , ' rejoined Brass , ' I will .
Parsing [sent. 8179 len. 4]: Ah Mr Witherden !
Parsing [sent. 8180 len. 32]: you little know the -- but I will not be tempted to travel from the point , sir , I believe the name of one of these gentlemen is Garland . '
Parsing [sent. 8181 len. 9]: ` Of both , ' said the notary .
Parsing [sent. 8182 len. 4]: ` In-deed ! '
Parsing [sent. 8183 len. 6]: rejoined Brass , cringing excessively .
Parsing [sent. 8184 len. 13]: ` But I might have known that , from the uncommon likeness .
Parsing [sent. 8185 len. 28]: Extremely happy , I am sure , to have the honour of an introduction to two such gentlemen , although the occasion is a most painful one .
Parsing [sent. 8186 len. 11]: One of you gentlemen has a servant called Kit ? '
Parsing [sent. 8187 len. 8]: ` Both , ' replied the notary .
Parsing [sent. 8188 len. 5]: ` Two Kits ? '
Parsing [sent. 8189 len. 4]: said Brass smiling .
Parsing [sent. 8190 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 8191 len. 20]: ` One Kit , sir , ' returned Mr Witherden angrily , ` who is employed by both gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 8192 len. 5]: What of him ? '
Parsing [sent. 8193 len. 16]: ` This of him , sir , ' rejoined Brass , dropping his voice impressively .
Parsing [sent. 8194 len. 50]: ` That young man , sir , that I have felt unbounded and unlimited confidence in , and always behaved to as if he was my equal -- that young man has this morning committed a robbery in my office , and been taken almost in the fact . '
Parsing [sent. 8195 len. 8]: ` This must be some falsehood ! '
Parsing [sent. 8196 len. 4]: cried the notary .
Parsing [sent. 8197 len. 11]: ` It is not possible , ' said Mr Abel .
Parsing [sent. 8198 len. 16]: ` I 'll not believe one word of it , ' exclaimed the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 8199 len. 48]: Mr Brass looked mildly round upon them , and rejoined , ` Mr Witherden , sir , YOUR words are actionable , and if I was a man of low and mean standing , who could n't afford to be slandered , I should proceed for damages .
Parsing [sent. 8200 len. 17]: Hows ` ever , sir , being what I am , I merely scorn such expressions .
Parsing [sent. 8201 len. 24]: The honest warmth of the other gentleman I respect , and I 'm truly sorry to be the messenger of such unpleasant news .
Parsing [sent. 8202 len. 37]: I should n't have put myself in this painful position , I assure you , but that the lad himself desired to be brought here in the first instance , and I yielded to his prayers .
Parsing [sent. 8203 len. 26]: Mr Chuckster , sir , will you have the goodness to tap at the window for the constable that 's waiting in the coach ? '
Parsing [sent. 8204 len. 63]: The three gentlemen looked at each other with blank faces when these words were uttered , and Mr Chuckster , doing as he was desired , and leaping off his stool with something of the excitement of an inspired prophet whose foretellings had in the fulness of time been realised , held the door open for the entrance of the wretched captive .
Parsing [sent. 8205 len. 50]: Such a scene as there was , when Kit came in , and bursting into the rude eloquence with which Truth at length inspired him , called Heaven to witness that he was innocent , and that how the property came to be found upon him he knew not !
Parsing [sent. 8206 len. 17]: Such a confusion of tongues , before the circumstances were related , and the proofs disclosed !
Parsing [sent. 8207 len. 20]: Such a dead silence when all was told , and his three friends exchanged looks of doubt and amazement !
Parsing [sent. 8208 len. 47]: ` Is it not possible , ' said Mr Witherden , after a long pause , ` that this note may have found its way into the hat by some accident , -- such as the removal of papers on the desk , for instance ? '
Parsing [sent. 8209 len. 10]: But this was clearly shown to be quite impossible .
Parsing [sent. 8210 len. 32]: Mr Swiveller , though an unwilling witness , could not help proving to demonstration , from the position in which it was found , that it must have been designedly secreted .
Parsing [sent. 8211 len. 18]: ` It 's very distressing , ' said Brass , ` immensely distressing , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 8212 len. 25]: When he comes to be tried , I shall be very happy to recommend him to mercy on account of his previous good character .
Parsing [sent. 8213 len. 19]: I did lose money before , certainly , but it does n't quite follow that he took it .
Parsing [sent. 8214 len. 20]: The presumption 's against him -- strongly against him -- but we 're Christians , I hope ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8215 len. 40]: I suppose , ' said the constable , looking round , ` that no gentleman here can give evidence as to whether he 's been flush of money of late , Do you happen to know , Sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8216 len. 26]: ` He has had money from time to time , certainly , ' returned Mr Garland , to whom the man had put the question .
Parsing [sent. 8217 len. 19]: ` But that , as he always told me , was given him by Mr Brass himself . '
Parsing [sent. 8218 len. 11]: ` Yes to be sure , ' said Kit eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 8219 len. 12]: ` You can bear me out in that , Sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8220 len. 4]: ` Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 8221 len. 15]: cried Brass , looking from face to face with an expression of stupid amazement .
Parsing [sent. 8222 len. 22]: ` The money you know , the half-crowns , that you gave me -- from the lodger , ' said Kit .
Parsing [sent. 8223 len. 6]: ` Oh dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 8224 len. 10]: cried Brass , shaking his head and frowning heavily .
Parsing [sent. 8225 len. 17]: ` This is a bad case , I find ; a very bad case indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 8226 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 8227 len. 14]: Did you give him no money on account of anybody , Sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8228 len. 9]: asked Mr Garland , with great anxiety . '
Parsing [sent. 8229 len. 8]: I give him money , Sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 8230 len. 3]: returned Sampson .
Parsing [sent. 8231 len. 12]: ` Oh , come you know , this is too barefaced .
Parsing [sent. 8232 len. 13]: Constable , my good fellow , we had better be going . '
Parsing [sent. 8233 len. 4]: ` What ! '
Parsing [sent. 8234 len. 3]: shrieked Kit .
Parsing [sent. 8235 len. 8]: ` Does he deny that he did ?
Parsing [sent. 8236 len. 7]: ask him , somebody , pray .
Parsing [sent. 8237 len. 12]: Ask him to tell you whether he did or not ! '
Parsing [sent. 8238 len. 7]: ` Did you , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8239 len. 5]: asked the notary . '
Parsing [sent. 8240 len. 50]: I tell you what , gentlemen , ' replied Brass , in a very grave manner , ` he 'll not serve his case this way , and really , if you feel any interest in him , you had better advise him to go upon some other tack .
Parsing [sent. 8241 len. 5]: Did I , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 8242 len. 7]: Of course I never did . '
Parsing [sent. 8243 len. 32]: ` Gentlemen , ' cried Kit , on whom a light broke suddenly , ` Master , Mr Abel , Mr Witherden , every one of you -- he did it !
Parsing [sent. 8244 len. 22]: What I have done to offend him , I do n't know , but this is a plot to ruin me .
Parsing [sent. 8245 len. 32]: Mind , gentlemen , it 's a plot , and whatever comes of it , I will say with my dying breath that he put that note in my hat himself !
Parsing [sent. 8246 len. 6]: Look at him , gentlemen !
Parsing [sent. 8247 len. 6]: see how he changes colour .
Parsing [sent. 8248 len. 14]: Which of us looks the guilty person -- he , or I ? '
Parsing [sent. 8249 len. 8]: ` You hear him , gentlemen ? '
Parsing [sent. 8250 len. 10]: said Brass , smiling , ` you hear him .
Parsing [sent. 8251 len. 19]: Now , does this case strike you as assuming rather a black complexion , or does it not ?
Parsing [sent. 8252 len. 21]: Is it at all a treacherous case , do you think , or is it one of mere ordinary guilt ?
Parsing [sent. 8253 len. 32]: Perhaps , gentlemen , if he had not said this in your presence and I had reported it , you 'd have held this to be impossible likewise , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 8254 len. 70]: With such pacific and bantering remarks did Mr Brass refute the foul aspersion on his character ; but the virtuous Sarah , moved by stronger feelings , and having at heart , perhaps , a more jealous regard for the honour of her family , flew from her brother 's side , without any previous intimation of her design , and darted at the prisoner with the utmost fury .
Parsing [sent. 8255 len. 106]: It would undoubtedly have gone hard with Kit 's face , but that the wary constable , foreseeing her design , drew him aside at the critical moment , and thus placed Mr Chuckster in circumstances of some jeopardy ; for that gentleman happening to be next the object of Miss Brass 's wrath ; and rage being , like love and fortune , blind ; was pounced upon by the fair enslaver , and had a false collar plucked up by the roots , and his hair very much dishevelled , before the exertions of the company could make her sensible of her mistake .
Parsing [sent. 8256 len. 103]: The constable , taking warning by this desperate attack , and thinking perhaps that it would be more satisfactory to the ends of justice if the prisoner were taken before a magistrate , whole , rather than in small pieces , led him back to the hackney-coach without more ado , and moreover insisted on Miss Brass becoming an outside passenger ; to which proposal the charming creature , after a little angry discussion , yielded her consent ; and so took her brother Sampson 's place upon the box : Mr Brass with some reluctance agreeing to occupy her seat inside .
Parsing [sent. 8257 len. 25]: These arrangements perfected , they drove to the justice-room with all speed , followed by the notary and his two friends in another coach .
Parsing [sent. 8258 len. 60]: Mr Chuckster alone was left behind -- greatly to his indignation ; for he held the evidence he could have given , relative to Kit 's returning to work out the shilling , to be so very material as bearing upon his hypocritical and designing character , that he considered its suppression little better than a compromise of felony .
Parsing [sent. 8259 len. 24]: At the justice-room , they found the single gentleman , who had gone straight there , and was expecting them with desperate impatience .
Parsing [sent. 8260 len. 81]: But not fifty single gentlemen rolled into one could have helped poor Kit , who in half an hour afterwards was committed for trial , and was assured by a friendly officer on his way to prison that there was no occasion to be cast down , for the sessions would soon be on , and he would , in all likelihood , get his little affair disposed of , and be comfortably transported , in less than a fortnight .
Parsing [sent. 8261 len. 36]: Chapter 61 Let moralists and philosophers say what they may , it is very questionable whether a guilty man would have felt half as much misery that night , as Kit did , being innocent .
Parsing [sent. 8262 len. 93]: The world , being in the constant commission of vast quantities of injustice , is a little too apt to comfort itself with the idea that if the victim of its falsehood and malice have a clear conscience , he can not fail to be sustained under his trials , and somehow or other to come right at last ; ` in which case , ' say they who have hunted him down , ' -- though we certainly do n't expect it -- nobody will be better pleased than we . '
Parsing [sent. 8263 len. 88]: Whereas , the world would do well to reflect , that injustice is in itself , to every generous and properly constituted mind , an injury , of all others the most insufferable , the most torturing , and the most hard to bear ; and that many clear consciences have gone to their account elsewhere , and many sound hearts have broken , because of this very reason ; the knowledge of their own deserts only aggravating their sufferings , and rendering them the less endurable .
Parsing [sent. 8264 len. 14]: The world , however , was not in fault in Kit 's case .
Parsing [sent. 8265 len. 127]: But Kit was innocent ; and knowing this , and feeling that his best friends deemed him guilty -- that Mr and Mrs Garland would look upon him as a monster of ingratitude -- that Barbara would associate him with all that was bad and criminal -- that the pony would consider himself forsaken -- and that even his own mother might perhaps yield to the strong appearances against him , and believe him to be the wretch he seemed -- knowing and feeling all this , he experienced , at first , an agony of mind which no words can describe , and walked up and down the little cell in which he was locked up for the night , almost beside himself with grief .
Parsing [sent. 8266 len. 39]: Even when the violence of these emotions had in some degree subsided , and he was beginning to grow more calm , there came into his mind a new thought , the anguish of which was scarcely less .
Parsing [sent. 8267 len. 68]: The child -- the bright star of the simple fellow 's life -- she , who always came back upon him like a beautiful dream -- who had made the poorest part of his existence , the happiest and best -- who had ever been so gentle , and considerate , and good -- if she were ever to hear of this , what would she think !
Parsing [sent. 8268 len. 73]: As this idea occurred to him , the walls of the prison seemed to melt away , and the old place to reveal itself in their stead , as it was wont to be on winter nights -- the fireside , the little supper table , the old man 's hat , and coat , and stick -- the half-opened door , leading to her little room -- they were all there .
Parsing [sent. 8269 len. 44]: And Nell herself was there , and he -- both laughing heartily as they had often done -- and when he had got as far as this , Kit could go no farther , but flung himself upon his poor bedstead and wept .
Parsing [sent. 8270 len. 94]: It was a long night , which seemed as though it would have no end ; but he slept too , and dreamed -- always of being at liberty , and roving about , now with one person and now with another , but ever with a vague dread of being recalled to prison ; not that prison , but one which was in itself a dim idea -- not of a place , but of a care and sorrow : of something oppressive and always present , and yet impossible to define .
Parsing [sent. 8271 len. 26]: At last , the morning dawned , and there was the jail itself -- cold , black , and dreary , and very real indeed .
Parsing [sent. 8272 len. 15]: He was left to himself , however , and there was comfort in that .
Parsing [sent. 8273 len. 67]: He had liberty to walk in a small paved yard at a certain hour , and learnt from the turnkey , who came to unlock his cell and show him where to wash , that there was a regular time for visiting , every day , and that if any of his friends came to see him , he would be fetched down to the grate .
Parsing [sent. 8274 len. 69]: When he had given him this information , and a tin porringer containing his breakfast , the man locked him up again ; and went clattering along the stone passage , opening and shutting a great many other doors , and raising numberless loud echoes which resounded through the building for a long time , as if they were in prison too , and unable to get out .
Parsing [sent. 8275 len. 49]: This turnkey had given him to understand that he was lodged , like some few others in the jail , apart from the mass of prisoners ; because he was not supposed to be utterly depraved and irreclaimable , and had never occupied apartments in that mansion before .
Parsing [sent. 8276 len. 44]: Kit was thankful for this indulgence , and sat reading the church catechism very attentively -LRB- though he had known it by heart from a little child -RRB- , until he heard the key in the lock , and the man entered again .
Parsing [sent. 8277 len. 13]: ` Now then , ' he said , ` come on ! '
Parsing [sent. 8278 len. 7]: ` Where to , Sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8279 len. 3]: asked Kit .
Parsing [sent. 8280 len. 59]: The man contented himself by briefly replying ` Wisitors ; ' and taking him by the arm in exactly the same manner as the constable had done the day before , led him , through several winding ways and strong gates , into a passage , where he placed him at a grating and turned upon his heel .
Parsing [sent. 8281 len. 20]: Beyond this grating , at the distance of about four or five feet , was another exactly like it .
Parsing [sent. 8282 len. 86]: In the space between , sat a turnkey reading a newspaper , and outside the further railing , Kit saw , with a palpitating heart , his mother with the baby in her arms ; Barbara 's mother with her never-failing umbrella ; and poor little Jacob , staring in with all his might , as though he were looking for the bird , or the wild beast , and thought the men were mere accidents with whom the bars could have no possible concern .
Parsing [sent. 8283 len. 82]: But when little Jacob saw his brother , and , thrusting his arms between the rails to hug him , found that he came no nearer , but still stood afar off with his head resting on the arm by which he held to one of the bars , he began to cry most piteously ; whereupon , Kit 's mother and Barbara 's mother , who had restrained themselves as much as possible , burst out sobbing and weeping afresh .
Parsing [sent. 8284 len. 18]: Poor Kit could not help joining them , and not one of them could speak a word .
Parsing [sent. 8285 len. 76]: During this melancholy pause , the turnkey read his newspaper with a waggish look -LRB- he had evidently got among the facetious paragraphs -RRB- until , happening to take his eyes off for an instant , as if to get by dint of contemplation at the very marrow of some joke of a deeper sort than the rest , it appeared to occur to him , for the first time , that somebody was crying .
Parsing [sent. 8286 len. 28]: ` Now , ladies , ladies , ' he said , looking round with surprise , ` I 'd advise you not to waste time like this .
Parsing [sent. 8287 len. 8]: It 's allowanced here , you know .
Parsing [sent. 8288 len. 11]: You must n't let that child make that noise either .
Parsing [sent. 8289 len. 7]: It 's against all rules . '
Parsing [sent. 8290 len. 27]: ` I 'm his poor mother , sir , ' -- sobbed Mrs Nubbles , curtseying humbly , ` and this is his brother , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8291 len. 8]: Oh dear me , dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 8292 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 8293 len. 26]: replied the turnkey , folding his paper on his knee , so as to get with greater convenience at the top of the next column .
Parsing [sent. 8294 len. 9]: ` It ca n't be helped you know .
Parsing [sent. 8295 len. 11]: He ai n't the only one in the same fix .
Parsing [sent. 8296 len. 10]: You must n't make a noise about it ! '
Parsing [sent. 8297 len. 7]: With that he went on reading .
Parsing [sent. 8298 len. 9]: The man was not unnaturally cruel or hard-hearted .
Parsing [sent. 8299 len. 35]: He had come to look upon felony as a kind of disorder , like the scarlet fever or erysipelas : some people had it -- some had n't -- just as it might be .
Parsing [sent. 8300 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8301 len. 31]: my darling Kit , ' said his mother , whom Barbara 's mother had charitably relieved of the baby , ` that I should see my poor boy here ! '
Parsing [sent. 8302 len. 18]: ` You do n't believe that I did what they accuse me of , mother dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 8303 len. 9]: cried Kit , in a choking voice . '
Parsing [sent. 8304 len. 5]: I believe it ! '
Parsing [sent. 8305 len. 78]: exclaimed the poor woman , ' I that never knew you tell a lie , or do a bad action from your cradle -- that have never had a moment 's sorrow on your account , except it was the poor meals that you have taken with such good humour and content , that I forgot how little there was , when I thought how kind and thoughtful you were , though you were but a child !
Parsing [sent. 8306 len. 36]: -- I believe it of the son that 's been a comfort to me from the hour of his birth until this time , and that I never laid down one night in anger with !
Parsing [sent. 8307 len. 7]: I believe it of you Kit !
Parsing [sent. 8308 len. 10]: -- ' ` Why then , thank God ! '
Parsing [sent. 8309 len. 22]: said Kit , clutching the bars with an earnestness that shook them , ` and I can bear it , mother !
Parsing [sent. 8310 len. 24]: Come what may , I shall always have one drop of happiness in my heart when I think that you said that . '
Parsing [sent. 8311 len. 15]: At this the poor woman fell a-crying again , and Barbara 's mother too .
Parsing [sent. 8312 len. 69]: And little Jacob , whose disjointed thoughts had by this time resolved themselves into a pretty distinct impression that Kit could n't go out for a walk if he wanted , and that there were no birds , lions , tigers or other natural curiosities behind those bars -- nothing indeed , but a caged brother -- added his tears to theirs with as little noise as possible .
Parsing [sent. 8313 len. 52]: Kit 's mother , drying her eyes -LRB- and moistening them , poor soul , more than she dried them -RRB- , now took from the ground a small basket , and submissively addressed herself to the turnkey , saying , would he please to listen to her for a minute ?
Parsing [sent. 8314 len. 31]: The turnkey , being in the very crisis and passion of a joke , motioned to her with his hand to keep silent one minute longer , for her life .
Parsing [sent. 8315 len. 67]: Nor did he remove his hand into its former posture , but kept it in the same warning attitude until he had finished the paragraph , when he paused for a few seconds , with a smile upon his face , as who should say ` this editor is a comical blade -- a funny dog , ' and then asked her what she wanted . '
Parsing [sent. 8316 len. 16]: I have brought him a little something to eat , ' said the good woman .
Parsing [sent. 8317 len. 13]: ` If you please , Sir , might he have it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8318 len. 9]: ` Yes , -- he may have it .
Parsing [sent. 8319 len. 7]: There 's no rule against that .
Parsing [sent. 8320 len. 18]: Give it to me when you go , and I 'll take care he has it . '
Parsing [sent. 8321 len. 56]: ` No , but if you please sir -- do n't be angry with me sir -- I am his mother , and you had a mother once -- if I might only see him eat a little bit , I should go away , so much more satisfied that he was all comfortable . '
Parsing [sent. 8322 len. 22]: And again the tears of Kit 's mother burst forth , and of Barbara 's mother , and of little Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 8323 len. 35]: As to the baby , it was crowing and laughing with its might -- under the idea , apparently , that the whole scene had been invented and got up for its particular satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 8324 len. 61]: The turnkey looked as if he thought the request a strange one and rather out of the common way , but nevertheless he laid down his paper , and coming round where Kit 's mother stood , took the basket from her , and after inspecting its contents , handed it to Kit , and went back to his place .
Parsing [sent. 8325 len. 61]: It may be easily conceived that the prisoner had no great appetite , but he sat down on the ground , and ate as hard as he could , while , at every morsel he put into his mouth , his mother sobbed and wept afresh , though with a softened grief that bespoke the satisfaction the sight afforded her .
Parsing [sent. 8326 len. 67]: While he was thus engaged , Kit made some anxious inquiries about his employers , and whether they had expressed any opinion concerning him ; but all he could learn was that Mr Abel had himself broken the intelligence to his mother , with great kindness and delicacy , late on the previous night , but had himself expressed no opinion of his innocence or guilt .
Parsing [sent. 8327 len. 48]: Kit was on the point of mustering courage to ask Barbara 's mother about Barbara , when the turnkey who had conducted him , reappeared , a second turnkey appeared behind his visitors , and the third turnkey with the newspaper cried ` Time 's up ! '
Parsing [sent. 8328 len. 14]: -- adding in the same breath ` Now for the next party ! '
Parsing [sent. 8329 len. 9]: and then plunging deep into his newspaper again .
Parsing [sent. 8330 len. 27]: Kit was taken off in an instant , with a blessing from his mother , and a scream from little Jacob , ringing in his ears .
Parsing [sent. 8331 len. 43]: As he was crossing the next yard with the basket in his hand , under the guidance of his former conductor , another officer called to them to stop , and came up with a pint pot of porter in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 8332 len. 19]: ` This is Christopher Nubbles , is n't it , that come in last night for felony ? '
Parsing [sent. 8333 len. 4]: said the man .
Parsing [sent. 8334 len. 11]: His comrade replied that this was the chicken in question .
Parsing [sent. 8335 len. 15]: ` Then here 's your beer , ' said the other man to Christopher .
Parsing [sent. 8336 len. 7]: ` What are you looking at ?
Parsing [sent. 8337 len. 10]: There a n't a discharge in it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8338 len. 9]: I beg your pardon , ' said Kit .
Parsing [sent. 8339 len. 7]: ` Who sent it me ? '
Parsing [sent. 8340 len. 11]: ` Why , your friend , ' replied the man .
Parsing [sent. 8341 len. 12]: ` You 're to have it every day , he says .
Parsing [sent. 8342 len. 12]: And so you will , if he pays for it . '
Parsing [sent. 8343 len. 5]: ` My friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 8344 len. 3]: repeated Kit .
Parsing [sent. 8345 len. 14]: ` You 're all abroad , seemingly , ' returned the other man .
Parsing [sent. 8346 len. 6]: ` There 's his letter .
Parsing [sent. 8347 len. 4]: Take hold ! '
Parsing [sent. 8348 len. 16]: Kit took it , and when he was locked up again , read as follows .
Parsing [sent. 8349 len. 24]: ` Drink of this cup , you 'll find there 's a spell in its every drop ` gainst the ills of mortality .
Parsing [sent. 8350 len. 9]: Talk of the cordial that sparkled for Helen !
Parsing [sent. 8351 len. 17]: HER cup was a fiction , but this is reality -LRB- Barclay and Co. 's -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 8352 len. 16]: -- If they ever send it in a flat state , complain to the Governor .
Parsing [sent. 8353 len. 10]: Yours , R. S. ' ` R. S. ! '
Parsing [sent. 8354 len. 7]: said Kit , after some consideration .
Parsing [sent. 8355 len. 8]: ` It must be Mr Richard Swiveller .
Parsing [sent. 8356 len. 15]: Well , its very kind of him , and I thank him heartily . '
Parsing [sent. 8357 len. 92]: Chapter 62 A faint light , twinkling from the window of the counting-house on Quilp 's wharf , and looking inflamed and red through the night-fog , as though it suffered from it like an eye , forewarned Mr Sampson Brass , as he approached the wooden cabin with a cautious step , that the excellent proprietor , his esteemed client , was inside , and probably waiting with his accustomed patience and sweetness of temper the fulfilment of the appointment which now brought Mr Brass within his fair domain . '
Parsing [sent. 8358 len. 37]: A treacherous place to pick one 's steps in , of a dark night , ' muttered Sampson , as he stumbled for the twentieth time over some stray lumber , and limped in pain . '
Parsing [sent. 8359 len. 35]: I believe that boy strews the ground differently every day , on purpose to bruise and maim one ; unless his master does it with his own hands , which is more than likely .
Parsing [sent. 8360 len. 10]: I hate to come to this place without Sally .
Parsing [sent. 8361 len. 10]: She 's more protection than a dozen men . '
Parsing [sent. 8362 len. 31]: As he paid this compliment to the merit of the absent charmer , Mr Brass came to a halt ; looking doubtfully towards the light , and over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 8363 len. 10]: ` What 's he about , I wonder ? '
Parsing [sent. 8364 len. 51]: murmured the lawyer , standing on tiptoe , and endeavouring to obtain a glimpse of what was passing inside , which at that distance was impossible -- ` drinking , I suppose , -- making himself more fiery and furious , and heating his malice and mischievousness till they boil .
Parsing [sent. 8365 len. 19]: I 'm always afraid to come here by myself , when his account 's a pretty large one .
Parsing [sent. 8366 len. 50]: I do n't believe he 'd mind throttling me , and dropping me softly into the river when the tide was at its strongest , any more than he 'd mind killing a rat -- indeed I do n't know whether he would n't consider it a pleasant joke .
Parsing [sent. 8367 len. 2]: Hark !
Parsing [sent. 8368 len. 6]: Now he 's singing ! '
Parsing [sent. 8369 len. 52]: Mr Quilp was certainly entertaining himself with vocal exercise , but it was rather a kind of chant than a song ; being a monotonous repetition of one sentence in a very rapid manner , with a long stress upon the last word , which he swelled into a dismal roar .
Parsing [sent. 8370 len. 101]: Nor did the burden of this performance bear any reference to love , or war , or wine , or loyalty , or any other , the standard topics of song , but to a subject not often set to music or generally known in ballads ; the words being these : -- ` The worthy magistrate , after remarking that the prisoner would find some difficulty in persuading a jury to believe his tale , committed him to take his trial at the approaching sessions ; and directed the customary recognisances to be entered into for the pros-e-cu-tion . '
Parsing [sent. 8371 len. 30]: Every time he came to this concluding word , and had exhausted all possible stress upon it , Quilp burst into a shriek of laughter , and began again .
Parsing [sent. 8372 len. 23]: ` He 's dreadfully imprudent , ' muttered Brass , after he had listened to two or three repetitions of the chant .
Parsing [sent. 8373 len. 4]: ` Horribly imprudent .
Parsing [sent. 8374 len. 6]: I wish he was dumb .
Parsing [sent. 8375 len. 6]: I wish he was deaf .
Parsing [sent. 8376 len. 6]: I wish he was blind .
Parsing [sent. 8377 len. 14]: Hang him , ' cried Brass , as the chant began again . '
Parsing [sent. 8378 len. 7]: I wish he was dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 8379 len. 49]: Giving utterance to these friendly aspirations in behalf of his client , Mr Sampson composed his face into its usual state of smoothness , and waiting until the shriek came again and was dying away , went up to the wooden house , and knocked at the door .
Parsing [sent. 8380 len. 5]: ` Come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 8381 len. 4]: cried the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 8382 len. 9]: ` How do you do to-night sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8383 len. 6]: said Sampson , peeping in .
Parsing [sent. 8384 len. 5]: ` Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 8385 len. 6]: How do you do sir ?
Parsing [sent. 8386 len. 8]: Oh dear me , how very whimsical !
Parsing [sent. 8387 len. 7]: Amazingly whimsical to be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 8388 len. 8]: ` Come in , you fool ! '
Parsing [sent. 8389 len. 18]: returned the dwarf , ` and do n't stand there shaking your head and showing your teeth .
Parsing [sent. 8390 len. 19]: Come in , you false witness , you perjurer , you suborner of evidence , come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 8391 len. 8]: ` He has the richest humour ! '
Parsing [sent. 8392 len. 17]: cried Brass , shutting the door behind him ; ` the most amazing vein of comicality !
Parsing [sent. 8393 len. 11]: But is n't it rather injudicious , sir -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 8394 len. 4]: ` What ? '
Parsing [sent. 8395 len. 3]: demanded Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 8396 len. 6]: ` What , Judas ? '
Parsing [sent. 8397 len. 4]: ` Judas ! '
Parsing [sent. 8398 len. 3]: cried Brass .
Parsing [sent. 8399 len. 7]: ` He has such extraordinary spirits !
Parsing [sent. 8400 len. 7]: His humour is so extremely playful !
Parsing [sent. 8401 len. 2]: Judas !
Parsing [sent. 8402 len. 10]: Oh yes -- dear me , how very good !
Parsing [sent. 8403 len. 5]: Ha ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 8404 len. 58]: All this time , Sampson was rubbing his hands , and staring , with ludicrous surprise and dismay , at a great , goggle-eyed , blunt-nosed figure-head of some old ship , which was reared up against the wall in a corner near the stove , looking like a goblin or hideous idol whom the dwarf worshipped .
Parsing [sent. 8405 len. 74]: A mass of timber on its head , carved into the dim and distant semblance of a cocked hat , together with a representation of a star on the left breast and epaulettes on the shoulders , denoted that it was intended for the effigy of some famous admiral ; but , without those helps , any observer might have supposed it the authentic portrait of a distinguished merman , or great sea-monster .
Parsing [sent. 8406 len. 26]: Being originally much too large for the apartment which it was now employed to decorate , it had been sawn short off at the waist .
Parsing [sent. 8407 len. 46]: Even in this state it reached from floor to ceiling ; and thrusting itself forward , with that excessively wide-awake aspect , and air of somewhat obtrusive politeness , by which figure-heads are usually characterised , seemed to reduce everything else to mere pigmy proportions .
Parsing [sent. 8408 len. 7]: ` Do you know it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8409 len. 9]: said the dwarf , watching Sampson 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8410 len. 8]: ` Do you see the likeness ? '
Parsing [sent. 8411 len. 4]: ` Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 8412 len. 21]: said Brass , holding his head on one side , and throwing it a little back , as connoisseurs do .
Parsing [sent. 8413 len. 97]: ` Now I look at it again , I fancy I see a -- yes , there certainly is something in the smile that reminds me of -- and yet upon my word I -- ' Now , the fact was , that Sampson , having never seen anything in the smallest degree resembling this substantial phantom , was much perplexed ; being uncertain whether Mr Quilp considered it like himself , and had therefore bought it for a family portrait ; or whether he was pleased to consider it as the likeness of some enemy .
Parsing [sent. 8414 len. 86]: He was not very long in doubt ; for , while he was surveying it with that knowing look which people assume when they are contemplating for the first time portraits which they ought to recognise but do n't , the dwarf threw down the newspaper from which he had been chanting the words already quoted , and seizing a rusty iron bar , which he used in lieu of poker , dealt the figure such a stroke on the nose that it rocked again .
Parsing [sent. 8415 len. 19]: ` Is it like Kit -- is it his picture , his image , his very self ? '
Parsing [sent. 8416 len. 21]: cried the dwarf , aiming a shower of blows at the insensible countenance , and covering it with deep dimples .
Parsing [sent. 8417 len. 22]: ` Is it the exact model and counterpart of the dog -- is it -- is it -- is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8418 len. 28]: And with every repetition of the question , he battered the great image , until the perspiration streamed down his face with the violence of the exercise .
Parsing [sent. 8419 len. 95]: Although this might have been a very comical thing to look at from a secure gallery , as a bull-fight is found to be a comfortable spectacle by those who are not in the arena , and a house on fire is better than a play to people who do n't live near it , there was something in the earnestness of Mr Quilp 's manner which made his legal adviser feel that the counting-house was a little too small , and a deal too lonely , for the complete enjoyment of these humours .
Parsing [sent. 8420 len. 44]: Therefore , he stood as far off as he could , while the dwarf was thus engaged ; whimpering out but feeble applause ; and when Quilp left off and sat down again from pure exhaustion , approached with more obsequiousness than ever .
Parsing [sent. 8421 len. 5]: ` Excellent indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 8422 len. 3]: cried Brass .
Parsing [sent. 8423 len. 4]: ` He he !
Parsing [sent. 8424 len. 6]: Oh , very good Sir .
Parsing [sent. 8425 len. 29]: You know , ' said Sampson , looking round as if in appeal to the bruised animal , ` he 's quite a remarkable man -- quite ! '
Parsing [sent. 8426 len. 10]: ` Sit down , ' said the dwarf . '
Parsing [sent. 8427 len. 6]: I bought the dog yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 8428 len. 22]: I 've been screwing gimlets into him , and sticking forks in his eyes , and cutting my name on him .
Parsing [sent. 8429 len. 9]: I mean to burn him at last . '
Parsing [sent. 8430 len. 5]: ` Ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 8431 len. 3]: cried Brass .
Parsing [sent. 8432 len. 7]: ` Extremely entertaining , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 8433 len. 14]: ` Come here , ' said Quilp , beckoning him to draw near .
Parsing [sent. 8434 len. 8]: ` What 's injudicious , hey ? '
Parsing [sent. 8435 len. 6]: ` Nothing Sir -- nothing .
Parsing [sent. 8436 len. 35]: Scarcely worth mentioning Sir ; but I thought that song -- admirably humorous in itself you know -- was perhaps rather -- ' ` Yes , ' said Quilp , ` rather what ? '
Parsing [sent. 8437 len. 46]: ` Just bordering , or as one may say remotely verging , upon the confines of injudiciousness perhaps , Sir , ' returned Brass , looking timidly at the dwarf 's cunning eyes , which were turned towards the fire and reflected its red light .
Parsing [sent. 8438 len. 4]: ` Why ? '
Parsing [sent. 8439 len. 7]: inquired Quilp , without looking up .
Parsing [sent. 8440 len. 60]: ` Why , you know , sir , ' returned Brass , venturing to be more familiar : ' -- the fact is , sir , that any allusion to these little combinings together , of friends , for objects in themselves extremely laudable , but which the law terms conspiracies , are -- you take me , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 8441 len. 12]: -- best kept snug and among friends , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 8442 len. 4]: ` Eh ! '
Parsing [sent. 8443 len. 11]: said Quilp , looking up with a perfectly vacant countenance .
Parsing [sent. 8444 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 8445 len. 12]: ` Cautious , exceedingly cautious , very right and proper ! '
Parsing [sent. 8446 len. 7]: cried Brass , nodding his head .
Parsing [sent. 8447 len. 16]: ` Mum , sir , even here -- my meaning , sir , exactly . '
Parsing [sent. 8448 len. 16]: ` YOUR meaning exactly , you brazen scarecrow , -- what 's your meaning ? '
Parsing [sent. 8449 len. 3]: retorted Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 8450 len. 11]: ` Why do you talk to me of combining together ?
Parsing [sent. 8451 len. 4]: Do I combine ?
Parsing [sent. 8452 len. 9]: Do I know anything about your combinings ? '
Parsing [sent. 8453 len. 18]: ` No no , sir -- certainly not ; not by any means , ' returned Brass .
Parsing [sent. 8454 len. 40]: ` if you so wink and nod at me , ' said the dwarf , looking about him as if for his poker , ` I 'll spoil the expression of your monkey 's face , I will . '
Parsing [sent. 8455 len. 24]: ` Do n't put yourself out of the way I beg , sir , ' rejoined Brass , checking himself with great alacrity .
Parsing [sent. 8456 len. 11]: ` You 're quite right , sir , quite right .
Parsing [sent. 8457 len. 10]: I should n't have mentioned the subject , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8458 len. 7]: It 's much better not to .
Parsing [sent. 8459 len. 7]: You 're quite right , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8460 len. 9]: Let us change it , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 8461 len. 14]: You were asking , sir , Sally told me , about our lodger .
Parsing [sent. 8462 len. 8]: He has not returned , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 8463 len. 4]: ` No ? '
Parsing [sent. 8464 len. 20]: said Quilp , heating some rum in a little saucepan , and watching it to prevent its boiling over .
Parsing [sent. 8465 len. 5]: ` Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 8466 len. 28]: ` Why , sir , ' returned Brass , ` he -- dear me , Mr Quilp , sir -- ' ` What 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 8467 len. 18]: said the dwarf , stopping his hand in the act of carrying the saucepan to his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 8468 len. 13]: ` You have forgotten the water , sir , ' said Brass .
Parsing [sent. 8469 len. 15]: ` And -- excuse me , sir -- but it 's burning hot . '
Parsing [sent. 8470 len. 63]: Deigning no other than a practical answer to this remonstrance , Mr Quilp raised the hot saucepan to his lips , and deliberately drank off all the spirit it contained , which might have been in quantity about half a pint , and had been but a moment before , when he took it off the fire , bubbling and hissing fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 8471 len. 20]: Having swallowed this gentle stimulant , and shaken his fist at the admiral , he bade Mr Brass proceed .
Parsing [sent. 8472 len. 32]: ` But first , ' said Quilp , with his accustomed grin , ` have a drop yourself -- a nice drop -- a good , warm , fiery drop . '
Parsing [sent. 8473 len. 45]: ` Why , sir , ' replied Brass , ` if there was such a thing as a mouthful of water that could be got without trouble -- ' ` There 's no such thing to be had here , ' cried the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 8474 len. 5]: ` Water for lawyers !
Parsing [sent. 8475 len. 29]: Melted lead and brimstone , you mean , nice hot blistering pitch and tar -- that 's the thing for them -- eh , Brass , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 8476 len. 6]: ` Ha ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 8477 len. 4]: laughed Mr Brass .
Parsing [sent. 8478 len. 5]: ` Oh very biting !
Parsing [sent. 8479 len. 19]: and yet it 's like being tickled -- there 's a pleasure in it too , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 8480 len. 18]: ` Drink that , ' said the dwarf , who had by this time heated some more .
Parsing [sent. 8481 len. 19]: ` Toss it off , do n't leave any heeltap , scorch your throat and be happy ! '
Parsing [sent. 8482 len. 84]: The wretched Sampson took a few short sips of the liquor , which immediately distilled itself into burning tears , and in that form came rolling down his cheeks into the pipkin again , turning the colour of his face and eyelids to a deep red , and giving rise to a violent fit of coughing , in the midst of which he was still heard to declare , with the constancy of a martyr , that it was ` beautiful indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 8483 len. 14]: While he was yet in unspeakable agonies , the dwarf renewed their conversation .
Parsing [sent. 8484 len. 15]: ` The lodger , ' said Quilp , ' -- what about him ? '
Parsing [sent. 8485 len. 23]: ` He is still , sir , ' returned Brass , with intervals of coughing , ` stopping with the Garland family .
Parsing [sent. 8486 len. 19]: He has only been home once , Sir , since the day of the examination of that culprit .
Parsing [sent. 8487 len. 47]: He informed Mr Richard , sir , that he could n't bear the house after what had taken place ; that he was wretched in it ; and that he looked upon himself as being in a certain kind of way the cause of the occurrence .
Parsing [sent. 8488 len. 7]: -- A very excellent lodger Sir .
Parsing [sent. 8489 len. 9]: I hope we may not lose him . '
Parsing [sent. 8490 len. 4]: ` Yah ! '
Parsing [sent. 8491 len. 4]: cried the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 8492 len. 25]: ` Never thinking of anybody but yourself -- why do n't you retrench then -- scrape up , hoard , economise , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 8493 len. 25]: ` Why , sir , ' replied Brass , ` upon my word I think Sarah 's as good an economiser as any going .
Parsing [sent. 8494 len. 8]: I do indeed , Mr Quilp . '
Parsing [sent. 8495 len. 15]: ` Moisten your clay , wet the other eye , drink , man ! '
Parsing [sent. 8496 len. 4]: cried the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 8497 len. 10]: ` You took a clerk to oblige me . '
Parsing [sent. 8498 len. 17]: ` Delighted , sir , I am sure , at any time , ' replied Sampson .
Parsing [sent. 8499 len. 9]: ` Yes , Sir , I did . '
Parsing [sent. 8500 len. 12]: ` Then now you may discharge him , ' said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 8501 len. 13]: ` There 's a means of retrenchment for you at once . '
Parsing [sent. 8502 len. 8]: ` Discharge Mr Richard , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8503 len. 3]: cried Brass .
Parsing [sent. 8504 len. 17]: ` Have you more than one clerk , you parrot , that you ask the question ?
Parsing [sent. 8505 len. 3]: Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 8506 len. 27]: ` Upon my word , Sir , ' said Brass , ' I was n't prepared for this -- ' ` How could you be ? '
Parsing [sent. 8507 len. 10]: sneered the dwarf , ` when I was n't ?
Parsing [sent. 8508 len. 92]: How often am I to tell you that I brought him to you that I might always have my eye on him and know where he was -- and that I had a plot , a scheme , a little quiet piece of enjoyment afoot , of which the very cream and essence was , that this old man and grandchild -LRB- who have sunk underground I think -RRB- should be , while he and his precious friend believed them rich , in reality as poor as frozen rats ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8509 len. 11]: I quite understood that , sir , ' rejoined Brass .
Parsing [sent. 8510 len. 4]: ` Thoroughly . '
Parsing [sent. 8511 len. 49]: ` Well , Sir , ' retorted Quilp , ` and do you understand now , that they 're not poor -- that they ca n't be , if they have such men as your lodger searching for them , and scouring the country far and wide ? '
Parsing [sent. 8512 len. 12]: ` Of course I do , Sir , ' said Sampson .
Parsing [sent. 8513 len. 17]: ` Of course you do , ' retorted the dwarf , viciously snapping at his words .
Parsing [sent. 8514 len. 19]: ` Of course do you understand then , that it 's no matter what comes of this fellow ?
Parsing [sent. 8515 len. 23]: of course do you understand that for any other purpose he 's no man for me , nor for you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8516 len. 26]: I have frequently said to Sarah , sir , ' returned Brass , ` that he was of no use at all in the business .
Parsing [sent. 8517 len. 11]: You ca n't put any confidence in him , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8518 len. 35]: If you 'll believe me I 've found that fellow , in the commonest little matters of the office that have been trusted to him , blurting out the truth , though expressly cautioned .
Parsing [sent. 8519 len. 18]: The aggravation of that chap sir , has exceeded anything you can imagine , it has indeed .
Parsing [sent. 8520 len. 64]: Nothing but the respect and obligation I owe to you , sir -- ' As it was plain that Sampson was bent on a complimentary harangue , unless he received a timely interruption , Mr Quilp politely tapped him on the crown of his head with the little saucepan , and requested that he would be so obliging as to hold his peace .
Parsing [sent. 8521 len. 27]: ` Practical , sir , practical , ' said Brass , rubbing the place and smiling ; ` but still extremely pleasant -- immensely so ! '
Parsing [sent. 8522 len. 9]: ` Hearken to me , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8523 len. 15]: returned Quilp , ` or I 'll be a little more pleasant , presently .
Parsing [sent. 8524 len. 11]: There 's no chance of his comrade and friend returning .
Parsing [sent. 8525 len. 23]: The scamp has been obliged to fly , as I learn , for some knavery , and has found his way abroad .
Parsing [sent. 8526 len. 6]: Let him rot there . '
Parsing [sent. 8527 len. 5]: ` Certainly , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8528 len. 3]: Quite proper .
Parsing [sent. 8529 len. 4]: -- Forcible ! '
Parsing [sent. 8530 len. 18]: cried Brass , glancing at the admiral again , as if he made a third in company .
Parsing [sent. 8531 len. 6]: ` Extremely forcible ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 8532 len. 22]: I hate him , ' said Quilp between his teeth , ` and have always hated him , for family reasons .
Parsing [sent. 8533 len. 16]: Besides , he was an intractable ruffian ; otherwise he would have been of use .
Parsing [sent. 8534 len. 7]: This fellow is pigeon-hearted and light-headed .
Parsing [sent. 8535 len. 8]: I do n't want him any longer .
Parsing [sent. 8536 len. 14]: Let him hang or drown -- starve -- go to the devil . '
Parsing [sent. 8537 len. 11]: ` By all means , sir , ' returned Brass .
Parsing [sent. 8538 len. 15]: ` When would you wish him , sir , to -- ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 8539 len. 8]: -- to make that little excursion ? '
Parsing [sent. 8540 len. 11]: ` When this trial 's over , ' said Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 8541 len. 15]: ` As soon as that 's ended , send him about his business . '
Parsing [sent. 8542 len. 17]: ` It shall be done , sir , ' returned Brass ; ` by all means .
Parsing [sent. 8543 len. 20]: It will be rather a blow to Sarah , sir , but she has all her feelings under control .
Parsing [sent. 8544 len. 39]: Ah , Mr Quilp , I often think , sir , if it had only pleased Providence to bring you and Sarah together , in earlier life , what blessed results would have flowed from such a union !
Parsing [sent. 8545 len. 9]: You never saw our dear father , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 8546 len. 5]: -- A charming gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 8547 len. 9]: Sarah was his pride and joy , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8548 len. 25]: He would have closed his eyes in bliss , would Foxey , Mr Quilp , if he could have found her such a partner .
Parsing [sent. 8549 len. 8]: You esteem her , sir ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8550 len. 9]: I love her , ' croaked the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 8551 len. 17]: ` You 're very good , Sir , ' returned Brass , ' I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 8552 len. 25]: Is there any other order , sir , that I can take a note of , besides this little matter of Mr Richard ? '
Parsing [sent. 8553 len. 12]: ` None , ' replied the dwarf , seizing the saucepan .
Parsing [sent. 8554 len. 9]: ` Let us drink the lovely Sarah . '
Parsing [sent. 8555 len. 29]: ` If we could do it in something , sir , that was n't quite boiling , ' suggested Brass humbly , ` perhaps it would be better .
Parsing [sent. 8556 len. 43]: I think it will be more agreeable to Sarah 's feelings , when she comes to hear from me of the honour you have done her , if she learns it was in liquor rather cooler than the last , Sir . '
Parsing [sent. 8557 len. 12]: But to these remonstrances , Mr Quilp turned a deaf ear .
Parsing [sent. 8558 len. 69]: Sampson Brass , who was , by this time , anything but sober , being compelled to take further draughts of the same strong bowl , found that , instead of at all contributing to his recovery , they had the novel effect of making the counting-house spin round and round with extreme velocity , and causing the floor and ceiling to heave in a very distressing manner .
Parsing [sent. 8559 len. 22]: After a brief stupor , he awoke to a consciousness of being partly under the table and partly under the grate .
Parsing [sent. 8560 len. 37]: This position not being the most comfortable one he could have chosen for himself , he managed to stagger to his feet , and , holding on by the admiral , looked round for his host .
Parsing [sent. 8561 len. 27]: Mr Brass 's first impression was , that his host was gone and had left him there alone -- perhaps locked him in for the night .
Parsing [sent. 8562 len. 30]: A strong smell of tobacco , however , suggested a new train of ideas , he looked upward , and saw that the dwarf was smoking in his hammock .
Parsing [sent. 8563 len. 11]: ` Good bye , Sir , ' cried Brass faintly .
Parsing [sent. 8564 len. 7]: ` Good bye , Sir . '
Parsing [sent. 8565 len. 9]: ` Wo n't you stop all night ? '
Parsing [sent. 8566 len. 7]: said the dwarf , peeping out .
Parsing [sent. 8567 len. 8]: ` Do stop all night ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 8568 len. 24]: I could n't indeed , Sir , ' replied Brass , who was almost dead from nausea and the closeness of the room .
Parsing [sent. 8569 len. 55]: ` If you 'd have the goodness to show me a light , so that I may see my way across the yard , sir -- ' Quilp was out in an instant ; not with his legs first , or his head first , or his arms first , but bodily -- altogether .
Parsing [sent. 8570 len. 24]: ` To be sure , ' he said , taking up a lantern , which was now the only light in the place .
Parsing [sent. 8571 len. 11]: ` Be careful how you go , my dear friend .
Parsing [sent. 8572 len. 18]: Be sure to pick your way among the timber , for all the rusty nails are upwards .
Parsing [sent. 8573 len. 8]: There 's a dog in the lane .
Parsing [sent. 8574 len. 28]: He bit a man last night , and a woman the night before , and last Tuesday he killed a child -- but that was in play .
Parsing [sent. 8575 len. 8]: Do n't go too near him . '
Parsing [sent. 8576 len. 12]: ` Which side of the road is he , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8577 len. 7]: asked Brass , in great dismay .
Parsing [sent. 8578 len. 26]: ` He lives on the right hand , ' said Quilp , ` but sometimes he hides on the left , ready for a spring .
Parsing [sent. 8579 len. 7]: He 's uncertain in that respect .
Parsing [sent. 8580 len. 7]: Mind you take care of yourself .
Parsing [sent. 8581 len. 10]: I 'll never forgive you if you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 8582 len. 18]: There 's the light out -- never mind -- you know the way -- straight on ! '
Parsing [sent. 8583 len. 47]: Quilp had slily shaded the light by holding it against his breast , and now stood chuckling and shaking from head to foot in a rapture of delight , as he heard the lawyer stumbling up the yard , and now and then falling heavily down .
Parsing [sent. 8584 len. 18]: At length , however , he got quit of the place , and was out of hearing .
Parsing [sent. 8585 len. 15]: The dwarf shut himself up again , and sprang once more into his hammock .
Parsing [sent. 8586 len. 49]: Chapter 63 The professional gentleman who had given Kit the consolatory piece of information relative to the settlement of his trifle of business at the Old Bailey , and the probability of its being very soon disposed of , turned out to be quite correct in his prognostications .
Parsing [sent. 8587 len. 10]: In eight days ' time , the sessions commenced .
Parsing [sent. 8588 len. 111]: In one day afterwards , the Grand jury found a True Bill against Christopher Nubbles for felony ; and in two days from that finding , the aforesaid Christopher Nubbles was called upon to plead Guilty or Not Guilty to an Indictment for that he the said Christopher did feloniously abstract and steal from the dwelling-house and office of one Sampson Brass , gentleman , one Bank Note for Five Pounds issued by the Governor and Company of the Bank of England ; in contravention of the Statutes in that case made and provided , and against the peace of our Sovereign Lord the King , his crown and dignity .
Parsing [sent. 8589 len. 115]: To this indictment , Christopher Nubbles , in a low and trembling voice , pleaded Not Guilty ; and here , let those who are in the habit of forming hasty judgments from appearances , and who would have had Christopher , if innocent , speak out very strong and loud , observe , that confinement and anxiety will subdue the stoutest hearts ; and that to one who has been close shut up , though it be only for ten or eleven days , seeing but stone walls and a very few stony faces , the sudden entrance into a great hall filled with life , is a rather disconcerting and startling circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 8590 len. 99]: To this , it must be added , that life in a wig is to a large class of people much more terrifying and impressive than life with its own head of hair ; and if , in addition to these considerations , there be taken into account Kit 's natural emotion on seeing the two Mr Garlands and the little Notary looking on with pale and anxious faces , it will perhaps seem matter of no very great wonder that he should have been rather out of sorts , and unable to make himself quite at home .
Parsing [sent. 8591 len. 36]: Although he had never seen either of the Mr Garlands , or Mr Witherden , since the time of his arrest , he had been given to understand that they had employed counsel for him .
Parsing [sent. 8592 len. 63]: Therefore , when one of the gentlemen in wigs got up and said ' I am for the prisoner , my Lord , ' Kit made him a bow ; and when another gentleman in a wig got up and said ` And I 'm against him , my Lord , ' Kit trembled very much , and bowed to him too .
Parsing [sent. 8593 len. 31]: And did n't he hope in his own heart that his gentleman was a match for the other gentleman , and would make him ashamed of himself in no time !
Parsing [sent. 8594 len. 91]: The gentleman who was against him had to speak first , and being in dreadfully good spirits -LRB- for he had , in the last trial , very nearly procured the acquittal of a young gentleman who had had the misfortune to murder his father -RRB- he spoke up , you may be sure ; telling the jury that if they acquitted this prisoner they must expect to suffer no less pangs and agonies than he had told the other jury they would certainly undergo if they convicted that prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 8595 len. 136]: And when he had told them all about the case , and that he had never known a worse case , he stopped a little while , like a man who had something terrible to tell them , and then said that he understood an attempt would be made by his learned friend -LRB- and here he looked sideways at Kit 's gentleman -RRB- to impeach the testimony of those immaculate witnesses whom he should call before them ; but he did hope and trust that his learned friend would have a greater respect and veneration for the character of the prosecutor ; than whom , as he well knew , there did not exist , and never had existed , a more honourable member of that most honourable profession to which he was attached .
Parsing [sent. 8596 len. 12]: And then he said , did the jury know Bevis Marks ?
Parsing [sent. 8597 len. 34]: And if they did know Bevis Marks -LRB- as he trusted for their own character , they did -RRB- did they know the historical and elevating associations connected with that most remarkable spot ?
Parsing [sent. 8598 len. 27]: Did they believe that a man like Brass could reside in a place like Bevis Marks , and not be a virtuous and most upright character ?
Parsing [sent. 8599 len. 50]: And when he had said a great deal to them on this point , he remembered that it was an insult to their understandings to make any remarks on what they must have felt so strongly without him , and therefore called Sampson Brass into the witness-box , straightway .
Parsing [sent. 8600 len. 72]: Then up comes Mr Brass , very brisk and fresh ; and , having bowed to the judge , like a man who has had the pleasure of seeing him before , and who hopes he has been pretty well since their last meeting , folds his arms , and looks at his gentleman as much as to say ` Here I am -- full of evidence -- Tap me ! '
Parsing [sent. 8601 len. 38]: And the gentleman does tap him presently , and with great discretion too ; drawing off the evidence by little and little , and making it run quite clear and bright in the eyes of all present .
Parsing [sent. 8602 len. 38]: Then , Kit 's gentleman takes him in hand , but can make nothing of him ; and after a great many very long questions and very short answers , Mr Sampson Brass goes down in glory .
Parsing [sent. 8603 len. 27]: To him succeeds Sarah , who in like manner is easy to be managed by Mr Brass 's gentleman , but very obdurate to Kit 's .
Parsing [sent. 8604 len. 45]: In short , Kit 's gentleman can get nothing out of her but a repetition of what she has said before -LRB- only a little stronger this time , as against his client -RRB- , and therefore lets her go , in some confusion .
Parsing [sent. 8605 len. 16]: Then , Mr Brass 's gentleman calls Richard Swiveller , and Richard Swiveller appears accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 8606 len. 52]: Now , Mr Brass 's gentleman has it whispered in his ear that this witness is disposed to be friendly to the prisoner -- which , to say the truth , he is rather glad to hear , as his strength is considered to lie in what is familiarly termed badgering .
Parsing [sent. 8607 len. 30]: Wherefore , he begins by requesting the officer to be quite sure that this witness kisses the book , then goes to work at him , tooth and nail .
Parsing [sent. 8608 len. 41]: ` Mr Swiveller , ' says this gentleman to Dick , when he had told his tale with evident reluctance and a desire to make the best of it : ` Pray sir , where did you dine yesterday ? '
Parsing [sent. 8609 len. 9]: -- ` Where did I dine yesterday ? '
Parsing [sent. 8610 len. 20]: -- ` Aye , sir , where did you dine yesterday -- was it near here , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8611 len. 15]: -- ` Oh to be sure -- yes -- just over the way . '
Parsing [sent. 8612 len. 6]: -- ` To be sure .
Parsing [sent. 8613 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8614 len. 19]: just over the way , ' repeats Mr Brass 's gentleman , with a glance at the court .
Parsing [sent. 8615 len. 7]: -- ` Alone , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8616 len. 25]: -- ' I beg your pardon , ' says Mr Swiveller , who has not caught the question -- ` Alone , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8617 len. 17]: repeats Mr Brass 's gentleman in a voice of thunder , ` did you dine alone ?
Parsing [sent. 8618 len. 7]: Did you treat anybody , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 8619 len. 3]: Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 8620 len. 22]: -- ` Oh yes , to be sure -- yes , I did , ' says Mr Swiveller with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 8621 len. 73]: -- ` Have the goodness to banish a levity , sir , which is very ill-suited to the place in which you stand -LRB- though perhaps you have reason to be thankful that it 's only that place -RRB- , ' says Mr Brass 's gentleman , with a nod of the head , insinuating that the dock is Mr Swiveller 's legitimate sphere of action ; ` and attend to me .
Parsing [sent. 8622 len. 17]: You were waiting about here , yesterday , in expectation that this trial was coming on .
Parsing [sent. 8623 len. 6]: You dined over the way .
Parsing [sent. 8624 len. 4]: You treated somebody .
Parsing [sent. 8625 len. 14]: Now , was that somebody brother to the prisoner at the bar ? '
Parsing [sent. 8626 len. 63]: -- Mr Swiveller is proceeding to explain -- ` Yes or No , sir , ' cries Mr Brass 's gentleman -- ` But will you allow me -- ' -- ` Yes or No , sir ' -- ` Yes it was , but -- ' -- ` Yes it was , ' cries the gentleman , taking him up short .
Parsing [sent. 8627 len. 10]: ` And a very pretty witness YOU are ! '
Parsing [sent. 8628 len. 7]: Down sits Mr Brass 's gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 8629 len. 19]: Kit 's gentleman , not knowing how the matter really stands , is afraid to pursue the subject .
Parsing [sent. 8630 len. 5]: Richard Swiveller retires abashed .
Parsing [sent. 8631 len. 26]: Judge , jury and spectators have visions of his lounging about , with an ill-looking , large-whiskered , dissolute young fellow of six feet high .
Parsing [sent. 8632 len. 27]: The reality is , little Jacob , with the calves of his legs exposed to the open air , and himself tied up in a shawl .
Parsing [sent. 8633 len. 22]: Nobody knows the truth ; everybody believes a falsehood ; and all because of the ingenuity of Mr Brass 's gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 8634 len. 16]: Then come the witnesses to character , and here Mr Brass 's gentleman shines again .
Parsing [sent. 8635 len. 37]: It turns out that Mr Garland has had no character with Kit , no recommendation of him but from his own mother , and that he was suddenly dismissed by his former master for unknown reasons .
Parsing [sent. 8636 len. 42]: ` Really Mr Garland , ' says Mr Brass 's gentleman , ` for a person who has arrived at your time of life , you are , to say the least of it , singularly indiscreet , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 8637 len. 11]: The jury think so too , and find Kit guilty .
Parsing [sent. 8638 len. 10]: He is taken off , humbly protesting his innocence .
Parsing [sent. 8639 len. 46]: The spectators settle themselves in their places with renewed attention , for there are several female witnesses to be examined in the next case , and it has been rumoured that Mr Brass 's gentleman will make great fun in cross-examining them for the prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 8640 len. 26]: Kit 's mother , poor woman , is waiting at the grate below stairs , accompanied by Barbara 's mother -LRB- who , honest soul !
Parsing [sent. 8641 len. 18]: never does anything but cry , and hold the baby -RRB- , and a sad interview ensues .
Parsing [sent. 8642 len. 8]: The newspaper-reading turnkey has told them all .
Parsing [sent. 8643 len. 30]: He do n't think it will be transportation for life , because there 's time to prove the good character yet , and that is sure to serve him .
Parsing [sent. 8644 len. 8]: He wonders what he did it for .
Parsing [sent. 8645 len. 7]: ` He never did it ! '
Parsing [sent. 8646 len. 5]: cries Kit 's mother .
Parsing [sent. 8647 len. 15]: ` Well , ' says the turnkey , ' I wo n't contradict you .
Parsing [sent. 8648 len. 15]: It 's all one , now , whether he did it or not . '
Parsing [sent. 8649 len. 35]: Kit 's mother can reach his hand through the bars , and she clasps it -- God , and those to whom he has given such tenderness , only know in how much agony .
Parsing [sent. 8650 len. 34]: Kit bids her keep a good heart , and , under pretence of having the children lifted up to kiss him , prays Barbara 's mother in a whisper to take her home .
Parsing [sent. 8651 len. 20]: ` Some friend will rise up for us , mother , ' cried Kit , ' I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 8652 len. 7]: If not now , before long .
Parsing [sent. 8653 len. 22]: My innocence will come out , mother , and I shall be brought back again ; I feel confidence in that .
Parsing [sent. 8654 len. 48]: You must teach little Jacob and the baby how all this was , for if they thought I had ever been dishonest , when they grew old enough to understand , it would break my heart to know it , if I was thousands of miles away .
Parsing [sent. 8655 len. 3]: -- Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8656 len. 15]: is there no good gentleman here , who will take care of her ! '
Parsing [sent. 8657 len. 19]: The hand slips out of his , for the poor creature sinks down upon the earth , insensible .
Parsing [sent. 8658 len. 57]: Richard Swiveller comes hastily up , elbows the bystanders out of the way , takes her -LRB- after some trouble -RRB- in one arm after the manner of theatrical ravishers , and , nodding to Kit , and commanding Barbara 's mother to follow , for he has a coach waiting , bears her swiftly off .
Parsing [sent. 8659 len. 7]: Well ; Richard took her home .
Parsing [sent. 8660 len. 23]: And what astonishing absurdities in the way of quotation from song and poem he perpetrated on the road , no man knows .
Parsing [sent. 8661 len. 53]: He took her home , and stayed till she was recovered ; and , having no money to pay the coach , went back in state to Bevis Marks , bidding the driver -LRB- for it was Saturday night -RRB- wait at the door while he went in for ` change . '
Parsing [sent. 8662 len. 16]: ` Mr Richard , sir , ' said Brass cheerfully , ` Good evening ! '
Parsing [sent. 8663 len. 28]: Monstrous as Kit 's tale had appeared , at first , Mr Richard did , that night , half suspect his affable employer of some deep villany .
Parsing [sent. 8664 len. 47]: Perhaps it was but the misery he had just witnessed which gave his careless nature this impulse ; but , be that as it may , it was very strong upon him , and he said in as few words as possible , what he wanted .
Parsing [sent. 8665 len. 4]: ` Money ? '
Parsing [sent. 8666 len. 8]: cried Brass , taking out his purse .
Parsing [sent. 8667 len. 4]: ` Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 8668 len. 13]: To be sure , Mr Richard , to be sure , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8669 len. 5]: All men must live .
Parsing [sent. 8670 len. 14]: You have n't change for a five-pound note , have you sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8671 len. 9]: ` No , ' returned Dick , shortly .
Parsing [sent. 8672 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 8673 len. 10]: said Brass , ` here 's the very sum .
Parsing [sent. 8674 len. 4]: That saves trouble .
Parsing [sent. 8675 len. 8]: You 're very welcome I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 8676 len. 21]: -- Mr Richard , sir -- ' Dick , who had by this time reached the door , turned round .
Parsing [sent. 8677 len. 21]: ` You need n't , ' said Brass , ` trouble yourself to come back any more , Sir . '
Parsing [sent. 8678 len. 4]: ` Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 8679 len. 54]: ` You see , Mr Richard , ' said Brass , thrusting his hands in his pockets , and rocking himself to and fro on his stool , ` the fact is , that a man of your abilities is lost , Sir , quite lost , in our dry and mouldy line .
Parsing [sent. 8680 len. 7]: It 's terrible drudgery -- shocking .
Parsing [sent. 8681 len. 48]: I should say , now , that the stage , or the -- or the army , Mr Richard -- or something very superior in the licensed victualling way -- was the kind of thing that would call out the genius of such a man as you .
Parsing [sent. 8682 len. 13]: I hope you 'll look in to see us now and then .
Parsing [sent. 8683 len. 11]: Sally , Sir , will be delighted I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 8684 len. 22]: She 's extremely sorry to lose you , Mr Richard , but a sense of her duty to society reconciles her .
Parsing [sent. 8685 len. 7]: An amazing creature that , sir !
Parsing [sent. 8686 len. 11]: You 'll find the money quite correct , I think .
Parsing [sent. 8687 len. 18]: There 's a cracked window sir , but I 've not made any deduction on that account .
Parsing [sent. 8688 len. 14]: Whenever we part with friends , Mr Richard , let us part liberally .
Parsing [sent. 8689 len. 7]: A delightful sentiment , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 8690 len. 47]: To all these rambling observations , Mr Swiveller answered not one word , but , returning for the aquatic jacket , rolled it into a tight round ball : looking steadily at Brass meanwhile as if he had some intention of bowling him down with it .
Parsing [sent. 8691 len. 20]: He only took it under his arm , however , and marched out of the office in profound silence .
Parsing [sent. 8692 len. 39]: When he had closed the door , he re-opened it , stared in again for a few moments with the same portentous gravity , and nodding his head once , in a slow and ghost-like manner , vanished .
Parsing [sent. 8693 len. 31]: He paid the coachman , and turned his back on Bevis Marks , big with great designs for the comforting of Kit 's mother and the aid of Kit himself .
Parsing [sent. 8694 len. 17]: But the lives of gentlemen devoted to such pleasures as Richard Swiveller , are extremely precarious .
Parsing [sent. 8695 len. 33]: The spiritual excitement of the last fortnight , working upon a system affected in no slight degree by the spirituous excitement of some years , proved a little too much for him .
Parsing [sent. 8696 len. 24]: That very night , Mr Richard was seized with an alarming illness , and in twenty-four hours was stricken with a raging fever .
Parsing [sent. 8697 len. 228]: Chapter 64 Tossing to and fro upon his hot , uneasy bed ; tormented by a fierce thirst which nothing could appease ; unable to find , in any change of posture , a moment 's peace or ease ; and rambling , ever , through deserts of thought where there was no resting-place , no sight or sound suggestive of refreshment or repose , nothing but a dull eternal weariness , with no change but the restless shiftings of his miserable body , and the weary wandering of his mind , constant still to one ever-present anxiety -- to a sense of something left undone , of some fearful obstacle to be surmounted , of some carking care that would not be driven away , and which haunted the distempered brain , now in this form , now in that , always shadowy and dim , but recognisable for the same phantom in every shape it took : darkening every vision like an evil conscience , and making slumber horrible -- in these slow tortures of his dread disease , the unfortunate Richard lay wasting and consuming inch by inch , until , at last , when he seemed to fight and struggle to rise up , and to be held down by devils , he sank into a deep sleep , and dreamed no more .
Parsing [sent. 8698 len. 3]: He awoke .
Parsing [sent. 8699 len. 45]: With a sensation of most blissful rest , better than sleep itself , he began gradually to remember something of these sufferings , and to think what a long night it had been , and whether he had not been delirious twice or thrice .
Parsing [sent. 8700 len. 34]: Happening , in the midst of these cogitations , to raise his hand , he was astonished to find how heavy it seemed , and yet how thin and light it really was .
Parsing [sent. 8701 len. 32]: Still , he felt indifferent and happy ; and having no curiosity to pursue the subject , remained in the same waking slumber until his attention was attracted by a cough .
Parsing [sent. 8702 len. 26]: This made him doubt whether he had locked his door last night , and feel a little surprised at having a companion in the room .
Parsing [sent. 8703 len. 62]: Still , he lacked energy to follow up this train of thought ; and unconsciously fell , in a luxury of repose , to staring at some green stripes on the bed-furniture , and associating them strangely with patches of fresh turf , while the yellow ground between made gravel-walks , and so helped out a long perspective of trim gardens .
Parsing [sent. 8704 len. 26]: He was rambling in imagination on these terraces , and had quite lost himself among them indeed , when he heard the cough once more .
Parsing [sent. 8705 len. 32]: The walks shrunk into stripes again at the sound , and raising himself a little in the bed , and holding the curtain open with one hand , he looked out .
Parsing [sent. 8706 len. 65]: The same room certainly , and still by candlelight ; but with what unbounded astonishment did he see all those bottles , and basins , and articles of linen airing by the fire , and such-like furniture of a sick chamber -- all very clean and neat , but all quite different from anything he had left there , when he went to bed !
Parsing [sent. 8707 len. 25]: The atmosphere , too , filled with a cool smell of herbs and vinegar ; the floor newly sprinkled ; the -- the what ?
Parsing [sent. 8708 len. 3]: The Marchioness ?
Parsing [sent. 8709 len. 10]: Yes ; playing cribbage with herself at the table .
Parsing [sent. 8710 len. 58]: There she sat , intent upon her game , coughing now and then in a subdued manner as if she feared to disturb him -- shuffling the cards , cutting , dealing , playing , counting , pegging -- going through all the mysteries of cribbage as if she had been in full practice from her cradle !
Parsing [sent. 8711 len. 29]: Mr Swiveller contemplated these things for a short time , and suffering the curtain to fall into its former position , laid his head on the pillow again .
Parsing [sent. 8712 len. 14]: ` I 'm dreaming , ' thought Richard , ` that 's clear .
Parsing [sent. 8713 len. 23]: When I went to bed , my hands were not made of egg-shells ; and now I can almost see through 'em .
Parsing [sent. 8714 len. 26]: If this is not a dream , I have woke up , by mistake , in an Arabian Night , instead of a London one .
Parsing [sent. 8715 len. 9]: But I have no doubt I 'm asleep .
Parsing [sent. 8716 len. 5]: Not the least . '
Parsing [sent. 8717 len. 8]: Here the small servant had another cough .
Parsing [sent. 8718 len. 5]: ` Very remarkable ! '
Parsing [sent. 8719 len. 5]: thought Mr Swiveller . '
Parsing [sent. 8720 len. 11]: I never dreamt such a real cough as that before .
Parsing [sent. 8721 len. 18]: I do n't know , indeed , that I ever dreamt either a cough or a sneeze .
Parsing [sent. 8722 len. 14]: Perhaps it 's part of the philosophy of dreams that one never does .
Parsing [sent. 8723 len. 10]: There 's another -- and another -- I say !
Parsing [sent. 8724 len. 8]: -- I 'm dreaming rather fast ! '
Parsing [sent. 8725 len. 22]: For the purpose of testing his real condition , Mr Swiveller , after some reflection , pinched himself in the arm .
Parsing [sent. 8726 len. 5]: ` Queerer still ! '
Parsing [sent. 8727 len. 4]: he thought . '
Parsing [sent. 8728 len. 19]: I came to bed rather plump than otherwise , and now there 's nothing to lay hold of .
Parsing [sent. 8729 len. 7]: I 'll take another survey . '
Parsing [sent. 8730 len. 38]: The result of this additional inspection was , to convince Mr Swiveller that the objects by which he was surrounded were real , and that he saw them , beyond all question , with his waking eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8731 len. 17]: ` It 's an Arabian Night ; that 's what it is , ' said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 8732 len. 9]: ` I 'm in Damascus or Grand Cairo .
Parsing [sent. 8733 len. 50]: The Marchioness is a Genie , and having had a wager with another Genie about who is the handsomest young man alive , and the worthiest to be the husband of the Princess of China , has brought me away , room and all , to compare us together .
Parsing [sent. 8734 len. 42]: Perhaps , ' said Mr Swiveller , turning languidly round on his pillow , and looking on that side of his bed which was next the wall , ` the Princess may be still -- No , she 's gone . '
Parsing [sent. 8735 len. 47]: Not feeling quite satisfied with this explanation , as , even taking it to be the correct one , it still involved a little mystery and doubt , Mr Swiveller raised the curtain again , determined to take the first favourable opportunity of addressing his companion .
Parsing [sent. 8736 len. 5]: An occasion presented itself .
Parsing [sent. 8737 len. 36]: The Marchioness dealt , turned up a knave , and omitted to take the usual advantage ; upon which Mr Swiveller called out as loud as he could -- ` Two for his heels ! '
Parsing [sent. 8738 len. 10]: The Marchioness jumped up quickly and clapped her hands .
Parsing [sent. 8739 len. 23]: ` Arabian Night , certainly , ' thought Mr Swiveller ; ` they always clap their hands instead of ringing the bell .
Parsing [sent. 8740 len. 17]: Now for the two thousand black slaves , with jars of jewels on their heads ! '
Parsing [sent. 8741 len. 55]: It appeared , however , that she had only clapped her hands for joy ; for directly afterward she began to laugh , and then to cry ; declaring , not in choice Arabic but in familiar English , that she was ` so glad , she did n't know what to do . '
Parsing [sent. 8742 len. 17]: ` Marchioness , ' said Mr Swiveller , thoughtfully , ` be pleased to draw nearer .
Parsing [sent. 8743 len. 30]: First of all , will you have the goodness to inform me where I shall find my voice ; and secondly , what has become of my flesh ? '
Parsing [sent. 8744 len. 28]: The Marchioness only shook her head mournfully , and cried again ; whereupon Mr Swiveller -LRB- being very weak -RRB- felt his own eyes affected likewise . '
Parsing [sent. 8745 len. 37]: I begin to infer , from your manner , and these appearances , Marchioness , ' said Richard after a pause , and smiling with a trembling lip , ` that I have been ill . '
Parsing [sent. 8746 len. 6]: ` You just have ! '
Parsing [sent. 8747 len. 9]: replied the small servant , wiping her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8748 len. 11]: ` And have n't you been a talking nonsense ! '
Parsing [sent. 8749 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 8750 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 8751 len. 11]: ` Very ill , Marchioness , have I been ? '
Parsing [sent. 8752 len. 13]: ` Dead , all but , ' replied the small servant . '
Parsing [sent. 8753 len. 8]: I never thought you 'd get better .
Parsing [sent. 8754 len. 6]: Thank Heaven you have ! '
Parsing [sent. 8755 len. 9]: Mr Swiveller was silent for a long while .
Parsing [sent. 8756 len. 18]: By and bye , he began to talk again , inquiring how long he had been there .
Parsing [sent. 8757 len. 10]: ` Three weeks to-morrow , ' replied the servant .
Parsing [sent. 8758 len. 5]: ` Three what ? '
Parsing [sent. 8759 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 8760 len. 17]: ` Weeks , ' returned the Marchioness emphatically ; ` three long , slow weeks . '
Parsing [sent. 8761 len. 30]: The bare thought of having been in such extremity , caused Richard to fall into another silence , and to lie flat down again , at his full length .
Parsing [sent. 8762 len. 50]: The Marchioness , having arranged the bed-clothes more comfortably , and felt that his hands and forehead were quite cool -- a discovery that filled her with delight -- cried a little more , and then applied herself to getting tea ready , and making some thin dry toast .
Parsing [sent. 8763 len. 54]: While she was thus engaged , Mr Swiveller looked on with a grateful heart , very much astonished to see how thoroughly at home she made herself , and attributing this attention , in its origin , to Sally Brass , whom , in his own mind , he could not thank enough .
Parsing [sent. 8764 len. 50]: When the Marchioness had finished her toasting , she spread a clean cloth on a tray , and brought him some crisp slices and a great basin of weak tea , with which -LRB- she said -RRB- the doctor had left word he might refresh himself when he awoke .
Parsing [sent. 8765 len. 79]: She propped him up with pillows , if not as skilfully as if she had been a professional nurse all her life , at least as tenderly ; and looked on with unutterable satisfaction while the patient -- stopping every now and then to shake her by the hand -- took his poor meal with an appetite and relish , which the greatest dainties of the earth , under any other circumstances , would have failed to provoke .
Parsing [sent. 8766 len. 24]: Having cleared away , and disposed everything comfortably about him again , she sat down at the table to take her own tea .
Parsing [sent. 8767 len. 14]: ` Marchioness , ' said Mr Swiveller , ` how 's Sally ? '
Parsing [sent. 8768 len. 22]: The small servant screwed her face into an expression of the very uttermost entanglement of slyness , and shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 8769 len. 11]: ` What , have n't you seen her lately ? '
Parsing [sent. 8770 len. 3]: said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 8771 len. 5]: ` Seen her ! '
Parsing [sent. 8772 len. 5]: cried the small servant .
Parsing [sent. 8773 len. 10]: ` Bless you , I 've run away ! '
Parsing [sent. 8774 len. 18]: Mr Swiveller immediately laid himself down again quite flat , and so remained for about five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 8775 len. 27]: By slow degrees he resumed his sitting posture after that lapse of time , and inquired : ` And where do you live , Marchioness ? '
Parsing [sent. 8776 len. 4]: ` Live ! '
Parsing [sent. 8777 len. 5]: cried the small servant .
Parsing [sent. 8778 len. 4]: ` Here ! '
Parsing [sent. 8779 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 8780 len. 4]: said Mr Swiveller .
Parsing [sent. 8781 len. 18]: And with that he fell down flat again , as suddenly as if he had been shot .
Parsing [sent. 8782 len. 52]: Thus he remained , motionless and bereft of speech , until she had finished her meal , put everything in its place , and swept the hearth ; when he motioned her to bring a chair to the bedside , and , being propped up again , opened a farther conversation .
Parsing [sent. 8783 len. 15]: ` And so , ' said Dick , ` you have run away ? '
Parsing [sent. 8784 len. 19]: ` Yes , ' said the Marchioness , ` and they 've been a tizing of me . '
Parsing [sent. 8785 len. 20]: ` Been -- I beg your pardon , ' said Dick -- ` what have they been doing ? '
Parsing [sent. 8786 len. 20]: ` Been a tizing of me -- tizing you know -- in the newspapers , ' rejoined the Marchioness .
Parsing [sent. 8787 len. 13]: ` Aye , aye , ' said Dick , ` advertising ? '
Parsing [sent. 8788 len. 8]: The small servant nodded , and winked .
Parsing [sent. 8789 len. 21]: Her eyes were so red with waking and crying , that the Tragic Muse might have winked with greater consistency .
Parsing [sent. 8790 len. 5]: And so Dick felt .
Parsing [sent. 8791 len. 20]: ` Tell me , ' said he , ` how it was that you thought of coming here . '
Parsing [sent. 8792 len. 51]: ` Why , you see , ' returned the Marchioness , ` when you was gone , I had n't any friend at all , because the lodger he never come back , and I did n't know where either him or you was to be found , you know .
Parsing [sent. 8793 len. 16]: But one morning , when I was -- ' ` Was near a keyhole ? '
Parsing [sent. 8794 len. 9]: suggested Mr Swiveller , observing that she faltered .
Parsing [sent. 8795 len. 68]: ` Well then , ' said the small servant , nodding ; ` when I was near the office keyhole -- as you see me through , you know -- I heard somebody saying that she lived here , and was the lady whose house you lodged at , and that you was took very bad , and would n't nobody come and take care of you .
Parsing [sent. 8796 len. 63]: Mr Brass , he says , `` It 's no business of mine , '' he says ; and Miss Sally , she says , `` He 's a funny chap , but it 's no business of mine ; '' and the lady went away , and slammed the door to , when she went out , I can tell you .
Parsing [sent. 8797 len. 33]: So I run away that night , and come here , and told 'em you was my brother , and they believed me , and I 've been here ever since . '
Parsing [sent. 8798 len. 13]: ` This poor little Marchioness has been wearing herself to death ! '
Parsing [sent. 8799 len. 3]: cried Dick .
Parsing [sent. 8800 len. 17]: ` No I have n't , ' she returned , ` not a bit of it .
Parsing [sent. 8801 len. 7]: Do n't you mind about me .
Parsing [sent. 8802 len. 22]: I like sitting up , and I 've often had a sleep , bless you , in one of them chairs .
Parsing [sent. 8803 len. 52]: But if you could have seen how you tried to jump out o ' winder , and if you could have heard how you used to keep on singing and making speeches , you would n't have believed it -- I 'm so glad you 're better , Mr Liverer . '
Parsing [sent. 8804 len. 5]: ` Liverer indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 8805 len. 4]: said Dick thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 8806 len. 9]: ` It 's well I am a liverer .
Parsing [sent. 8807 len. 15]: I strongly suspect I should have died , Marchioness , but for you . '
Parsing [sent. 8808 len. 64]: At this point , Mr Swiveller took the small servant 's hand in his again , and being , as we have seen , but poorly , might in struggling to express his thanks have made his eyes as red as hers , but that she quickly changed the theme by making him lie down , and urging him to keep very quiet .
Parsing [sent. 8809 len. 29]: ` The doctor , ' she told him , ` said you was to be kept quite still , and there was to be no noise nor nothing .
Parsing [sent. 8810 len. 13]: Now , take a rest , and then we 'll talk again .
Parsing [sent. 8811 len. 9]: I 'll sit by you , you know .
Parsing [sent. 8812 len. 13]: If you shut your eyes , perhaps you 'll go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 8813 len. 14]: You 'll be all the better for it , if you do . '
Parsing [sent. 8814 len. 44]: The Marchioness , in saying these words , brought a little table to the bedside , took her seat at it , and began to work away at the concoction of some cooling drink , with the address of a score of chemists .
Parsing [sent. 8815 len. 25]: Richard Swiveller being indeed fatigued , fell into a slumber , and waking in about half an hour , inquired what time it was .
Parsing [sent. 8816 len. 20]: ` Just gone half after six , ' replied his small friend , helping him to sit up again .
Parsing [sent. 8817 len. 37]: ` Marchioness , ' said Richard , passing his hand over his forehead and turning suddenly round , as though the subject but that moment flashed upon him , ` what has become of Kit ? '
Parsing [sent. 8818 len. 15]: He had been sentenced to transportation for a great many years , she said .
Parsing [sent. 8819 len. 6]: ` Has he gone ? '
Parsing [sent. 8820 len. 19]: asked Dick -- ` his mother -- how is she , -- what has become of her ? '
Parsing [sent. 8821 len. 15]: His nurse shook her head , and answered that she knew nothing about them .
Parsing [sent. 8822 len. 41]: ` But , if I thought , ' said she , very slowly , ` that you 'd keep quiet , and not put yourself into another fever , I could tell you -- but I wo n't now . '
Parsing [sent. 8823 len. 9]: ` Yes , do , ' said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 8824 len. 7]: ` It will amuse me . '
Parsing [sent. 8825 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8826 len. 5]: would it though ! '
Parsing [sent. 8827 len. 11]: rejoined the small servant , with a horrified look . '
Parsing [sent. 8828 len. 6]: I know better than that .
Parsing [sent. 8829 len. 13]: Wait till you 're better and then I 'll tell you . '
Parsing [sent. 8830 len. 43]: Dick looked very earnestly at his little friend : and his eyes , being large and hollow from illness , assisted the expression so much , that she was quite frightened , and besought him not to think any more about it .
Parsing [sent. 8831 len. 33]: What had already fallen from her , however , had not only piqued his curiosity , but seriously alarmed him , wherefore he urged her to tell him the worst at once .
Parsing [sent. 8832 len. 15]: ` Oh there 's no worst in it , ' said the small servant .
Parsing [sent. 8833 len. 11]: ` It has n't anything to do with you . '
Parsing [sent. 8834 len. 28]: ` Has it anything to do with -- is it anything you heard through chinks or keyholes -- and that you were not intended to hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 8835 len. 8]: asked Dick , in a breathless state .
Parsing [sent. 8836 len. 9]: ` Yes , ' replied the small servant .
Parsing [sent. 8837 len. 8]: ` In -- in Bevis Marks ? '
Parsing [sent. 8838 len. 4]: pursued Dick hastily .
Parsing [sent. 8839 len. 8]: ` Conversations between Brass and Sally ? '
Parsing [sent. 8840 len. 10]: ` Yes , ' cried the small servant again .
Parsing [sent. 8841 len. 55]: Richard Swiveller thrust his lank arm out of bed , and , gripping her by the wrist and drawing her close to him , bade her out with it , and freely too , or he would not answer for the consequences ; being wholly unable to endure the state of excitement and expectation .
Parsing [sent. 8842 len. 58]: She , seeing that he was greatly agitated , and that the effects of postponing her revelation might be much more injurious than any that were likely to ensue from its being made at once , promised compliance , on condition that the patient kept himself perfectly quiet , and abstained from starting up or tossing about .
Parsing [sent. 8843 len. 21]: ` But if you begin to do that , ' said the small servant , ` I 'll leave off .
Parsing [sent. 8844 len. 7]: And so I tell you . '
Parsing [sent. 8845 len. 17]: ` You ca n't leave off , till you have gone on , ' said Dick .
Parsing [sent. 8846 len. 11]: ` And do go on , there 's a darling .
Parsing [sent. 8847 len. 6]: Speak , sister , speak .
Parsing [sent. 8848 len. 4]: Pretty Polly say .
Parsing [sent. 8849 len. 18]: Oh tell me when , and tell me where , pray Marchioness , I beseech you ! '
Parsing [sent. 8850 len. 35]: Unable to resist these fervent adjurations , which Richard Swiveller poured out as passionately as if they had been of the most solemn and tremendous nature , his companion spoke thus : ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 8851 len. 21]: Before I run away , I used to sleep in the kitchen -- where we played cards , you know .
Parsing [sent. 8852 len. 33]: Miss Sally used to keep the key of the kitchen door in her pocket , and she always come down at night to take away the candle and rake out the fire .
Parsing [sent. 8853 len. 57]: When she had done that , she left me to go to bed in the dark , locked the door on the outside , put the key in her pocket again , and kept me locked up till she come down in the morning -- very early I can tell you -- and let me out .
Parsing [sent. 8854 len. 32]: I was terrible afraid of being kept like this , because if there was a fire , I thought they might forget me and only take care of themselves you know .
Parsing [sent. 8855 len. 41]: So , whenever I see an old rusty key anywhere , I picked it up and tried if it would fit the door , and at last I found in the dust cellar a key that did fit it . '
Parsing [sent. 8856 len. 12]: Here , Mr Swiveller made a violent demonstration with his legs .
Parsing [sent. 8857 len. 28]: But the small servant immediately pausing in her talk , he subsided again , and pleading a momentary forgetfulness of their compact , entreated her to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 8858 len. 13]: ` They kept me very short , ' said the small servant .
Parsing [sent. 8859 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8860 len. 10]: you ca n't think how short they kept me !
Parsing [sent. 8861 len. 54]: So I used to come out at night after they 'd gone to bed , and feel about in the dark for bits of biscuit , or sangwitches that you 'd left in the office , or even pieces of orange peel to put into cold water and make believe it was wine .
Parsing [sent. 8862 len. 10]: Did you ever taste orange peel and water ? '
Parsing [sent. 8863 len. 26]: Mr Swiveller replied that he had never tasted that ardent liquor ; and once more urged his friend to resume the thread of her narrative .
Parsing [sent. 8864 len. 43]: ` If you make believe very much , it 's quite nice , ' said the small servant , ` but if you do n't , you know , it seems as if it would bear a little more seasoning , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 8865 len. 87]: Well , sometimes I used to come out after they 'd gone to bed , and sometimes before , you know ; and one or two nights before there was all that precious noise in the office -- when the young man was took , I mean -- I come upstairs while Mr Brass and Miss Sally was a-sittin ' at the office fire ; and I tell you the truth , that I come to listen again , about the key of the safe . '
Parsing [sent. 8866 len. 29]: Mr Swiveller gathered up his knees so as to make a great cone of the bedclothes , and conveyed into his countenance an expression of the utmost concern .
Parsing [sent. 8867 len. 25]: But the small servant pausing , and holding up her finger , the cone gently disappeared , though the look of concern did not .
Parsing [sent. 8868 len. 25]: ` There was him and her , ' said the small servant , ` a-sittin ' by the fire , and talking softly together .
Parsing [sent. 8869 len. 42]: Mr Brass says to Miss Sally , `` Upon my word , '' he says `` it 's a dangerous thing , and it might get us into a world of trouble , and I do n't half like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8870 len. 48]: She says -- you know her way -- she says , `` You 're the chickenest-hearted , feeblest , faintest man I ever see , and I think , '' she says , `` that I ought to have been the brother , and you the sister .
Parsing [sent. 8871 len. 14]: Is n't Quilp , '' she says , `` our principal support ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8872 len. 33]: `` He certainly is , '' says Mr Brass , `` And a n't we , '' she says , `` constantly ruining somebody or other in the way of business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8873 len. 10]: `` We certainly are , '' says Mr Brass .
Parsing [sent. 8874 len. 21]: `` Then does it signify , '' she says , `` about ruining this Kit when Quilp desires it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8875 len. 12]: `` It certainly does not signify , '' says Mr Brass .
Parsing [sent. 8876 len. 50]: Then they whispered and laughed for a long time about there being no danger if it was well done , and then Mr Brass pulls out his pocket-book , and says , `` Well , '' he says , ` here it is -- Quilp 's own five-pound note .
Parsing [sent. 8877 len. 12]: We 'll agree that way , then , '' he says .
Parsing [sent. 8878 len. 10]: `` Kit 's coming to-morrow morning , I know .
Parsing [sent. 8879 len. 21]: While he 's up-stairs , you 'll get out of the way , and I 'll clear off Mr Richard .
Parsing [sent. 8880 len. 19]: Having Kit alone , I 'll hold him in conversation , and put this property in his hat .
Parsing [sent. 8881 len. 25]: I 'll manage so , besides , '' he says , ` that Mr Richard shall find it there , and be the evidence .
Parsing [sent. 8882 len. 33]: And if that do n't get Christopher out of Mr Quilp 's way , and satisfy Mr Quilp 's grudges , '' he says , `` the Devil 's in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8883 len. 34]: Miss Sally laughed , and said that was the plan , and as they seemed to be moving away , and I was afraid to stop any longer , I went down-stairs again .
Parsing [sent. 8884 len. 4]: -- There ! '
Parsing [sent. 8885 len. 41]: The small servant had gradually worked herself into as much agitation as Mr Swiveller , and therefore made no effort to restrain him when he sat up in bed and hastily demanded whether this story had been told to anybody .
Parsing [sent. 8886 len. 7]: ` How could it be ? '
Parsing [sent. 8887 len. 5]: replied his nurse . '
Parsing [sent. 8888 len. 19]: I was almost afraid to think about it , and hoped the young man would be let off .
Parsing [sent. 8889 len. 46]: When I heard 'em say they had found him guilty of what he did n't do , you was gone , and so was the lodger -- though I think I should have been frightened to tell him , even if he 'd been there .
Parsing [sent. 8890 len. 27]: Ever since I come here , you 've been out of your senses , and what would have been the good of telling you then ? '
Parsing [sent. 8891 len. 53]: ` Marchioness , ' said Mr Swiveller , plucking off his nightcap and flinging it to the other end of the room ; ` if you 'll do me the favour to retire for a few minutes and see what sort of a night it is , I 'll get up . '
Parsing [sent. 8892 len. 16]: ` You must n't think of such a thing , ' cried his nurse . '
Parsing [sent. 8893 len. 14]: I must indeed , ' said the patient , looking round the room .
Parsing [sent. 8894 len. 7]: ` Whereabouts are my clothes ? '
Parsing [sent. 8895 len. 19]: ` Oh , I 'm so glad -- you have n't got any , ' replied the Marchioness .
Parsing [sent. 8896 len. 4]: ` Ma'am ! '
Parsing [sent. 8897 len. 8]: said Mr Swiveller , in great astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 8898 len. 22]: ` I 've been obliged to sell them , every one , to get the things that was ordered for you .
Parsing [sent. 8899 len. 21]: But do n't take on about that , ' urged the Marchioness , as Dick fell back upon his pillow .
Parsing [sent. 8900 len. 12]: ` You 're too weak to stand , indeed . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8901 len. 15]: I am afraid , ' said Richard dolefully , ` that you 're right .
Parsing [sent. 8902 len. 6]: What ought I to do !
Parsing [sent. 8903 len. 7]: what is to be done ! '
Parsing [sent. 8904 len. 28]: It naturally occurred to him on very little reflection , that the first step to take would be to communicate with one of the Mr Garlands instantly .
Parsing [sent. 8905 len. 14]: It was very possible that Mr Abel had not yet left the office .
Parsing [sent. 8906 len. 66]: In as little time as it takes to tell it , the small servant had the address in pencil on a piece of paper ; a verbal description of father and son , which would enable her to recognise either , without difficulty ; and a special caution to be shy of Mr Chuckster , in consequence of that gentleman 's known antipathy to Kit .
Parsing [sent. 8907 len. 28]: Armed with these slender powers , she hurried away , commissioned to bring either old Mr Garland or Mr Abel , bodily , to that apartment . '
Parsing [sent. 8908 len. 46]: I suppose , ' said Dick , as she closed the door slowly , and peeped into the room again , to make sure that he was comfortable , ' I suppose there 's nothing left -- not so much as a waistcoat even ? '
Parsing [sent. 8909 len. 6]: ` No , nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 8910 len. 32]: ` It 's embarrassing , ' said Mr Swiveller , ` in case of fire -- even an umbrella would be something -- but you did quite right , dear Marchioness .
Parsing [sent. 8911 len. 8]: I should have died without you ! '
Parsing [sent. 8912 len. 61]: Chapter 65 It was well for the small servant that she was of a sharp , quick nature , or the consequence of sending her out alone , from the very neighbourhood in which it was most dangerous for her to appear , would probably have been the restoration of Miss Sally Brass to the supreme authority over her person .
Parsing [sent. 8913 len. 64]: Not unmindful of the risk she ran , however , the Marchioness no sooner left the house than she dived into the first dark by-way that presented itself , and , without any present reference to the point to which her journey tended , made it her first business to put two good miles of brick and mortar between herself and Bevis Marks .
Parsing [sent. 8914 len. 54]: When she had accomplished this object , she began to shape her course for the notary 's office , to which -- shrewdly inquiring of apple-women and oyster-sellers at street-corners , rather than in lighted shops or of well-dressed people , at the hazard of attracting notice -- she easily procured a direction .
Parsing [sent. 8915 len. 63]: As carrier-pigeons , on being first let loose in a strange place , beat the air at random for a short time before darting off towards the spot for which they are designed , so did the Marchioness flutter round and round until she believed herself in safety , and then bear swiftly down upon the port for which she was bound .
Parsing [sent. 8916 len. 80]: She had no bonnet -- nothing on her head but a great cap which , in some old time , had been worn by Sally Brass , whose taste in head-dresses was , as we have seen , peculiar -- and her speed was rather retarded than assisted by her shoes , which , being extremely large and slipshod , flew off every now and then , and were difficult to find again , among the crowd of passengers .
Parsing [sent. 8917 len. 74]: Indeed , the poor little creature experienced so much trouble and delay from having to grope for these articles of dress in mud and kennel , and suffered in these researches so much jostling , pushing , squeezing and bandying from hand to hand , that by the time she reached the street in which the notary lived , she was fairly worn out and exhausted , and could not refrain from tears .
Parsing [sent. 8918 len. 35]: But to have got there at last was a great comfort , especially as there were lights still burning in the office window , and therefore some hope that she was not too late .
Parsing [sent. 8919 len. 28]: So the Marchioness dried her eyes with the backs of her hands , and , stealing softly up the steps , peeped in through the glass door .
Parsing [sent. 8920 len. 58]: Mr Chuckster was standing behind the lid of his desk , making such preparations towards finishing off for the night , as pulling down his wristbands and pulling up his shirt-collar , settling his neck more gracefully in his stock , and secretly arranging his whiskers by the aid of a little triangular bit of looking glass .
Parsing [sent. 8921 len. 42]: Before the ashes of the fire stood two gentlemen , one of whom she rightly judged to be the notary , and the other -LRB- who was buttoning his great-coat and was evidently about to depart immediately -RRB- Mr Abel Garland .
Parsing [sent. 8922 len. 49]: Having made these observations , the small spy took counsel with herself , and resolved to wait in the street until Mr Abel came out , as there would be then no fear of having to speak before Mr Chuckster , and less difficulty in delivering her message .
Parsing [sent. 8923 len. 21]: With this purpose she slipped out again , and crossing the road , sat down upon a door-step just opposite .
Parsing [sent. 8924 len. 31]: She had hardly taken this position , when there came dancing up the street , with his legs all wrong , and his head everywhere by turns , a pony .
Parsing [sent. 8925 len. 81]: This pony had a little phaeton behind him , and a man in it ; but neither man nor phaeton seemed to embarrass him in the least , as he reared up on his hind legs , or stopped , or went on , or stood still again , or backed , or went side-ways , without the smallest reference to them -- just as the fancy seized him , and as if he were the freest animal in creation .
Parsing [sent. 8926 len. 43]: When they came to the notary 's door , the man called out in a very respectful manner , ` Woa then ' -- intimating that if he might venture to express a wish , it would be that they stopped there .
Parsing [sent. 8927 len. 63]: The pony made a moment 's pause ; but , as if it occurred to him that to stop when he was required might be to establish an inconvenient and dangerous precedent , he immediately started off again , rattled at a fast trot to the street corner , wheeled round , came back , and then stopped of his own accord .
Parsing [sent. 8928 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8929 len. 7]: you 're a precious creatur ! '
Parsing [sent. 8930 len. 27]: said the man -- who did n't venture by the bye to come out in his true colours until he was safe on the pavement . '
Parsing [sent. 8931 len. 13]: I wish I had the rewarding of you -- I do . '
Parsing [sent. 8932 len. 8]: ` What has he been doing ? '
Parsing [sent. 8933 len. 17]: said Mr Abel , tying a shawl round his neck as he came down the steps .
Parsing [sent. 8934 len. 17]: ` He 's enough to fret a man 's heart out , ' replied the hostler .
Parsing [sent. 8935 len. 15]: ` He is the most wicious rascal -- Woa then , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8936 len. 26]: ` He 'll never stand still , if you call him names , ' said Mr Abel , getting in , and taking the reins .
Parsing [sent. 8937 len. 15]: ` He 's a very good fellow if you know how to manage him .
Parsing [sent. 8938 len. 33]: This is the first time he has been out , this long while , for he has lost his old driver and would n't stir for anybody else , till this morning .
Parsing [sent. 8939 len. 8]: The lamps are right , are they ?
Parsing [sent. 8940 len. 4]: That 's well .
Parsing [sent. 8941 len. 11]: Be here to take him to-morrow , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 8942 len. 4]: Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 8943 len. 29]: And , after one or two strange plunges , quite of his own invention , the pony yielded to Mr Abel 's mildness , and trotted gently off .
Parsing [sent. 8944 len. 22]: All this time Mr Chuckster had been standing at the door , and the small servant had been afraid to approach .
Parsing [sent. 8945 len. 25]: She had nothing for it now , therefore , but to run after the chaise , and to call to Mr Abel to stop .
Parsing [sent. 8946 len. 19]: Being out of breath when she came up with it , she was unable to make him hear .
Parsing [sent. 8947 len. 13]: The case was desperate ; for the pony was quickening his pace .
Parsing [sent. 8948 len. 47]: The Marchioness hung on behind for a few moments , and , feeling that she could go no farther , and must soon yield , clambered by a vigorous effort into the hinder seat , and in so doing lost one of the shoes for ever .
Parsing [sent. 8949 len. 112]: Mr Abel being in a thoughtful frame of mind , and having quite enough to do to keep the pony going , went jogging on without looking round : little dreaming of the strange figure that was close behind him , until the Marchioness , having in some degree recovered her breath , and the loss of her shoe , and the novelty of her position , uttered close into his ear , the words -- ' I say , Sir ' -- He turned his head quickly enough then , and stopping the pony , cried , with some trepidation , ` God bless me , what is this ! '
Parsing [sent. 8950 len. 15]: ` Do n't be frightened , Sir , ' replied the still panting messenger .
Parsing [sent. 8951 len. 12]: ` Oh I 've run such a way after you ! '
Parsing [sent. 8952 len. 9]: ` What do you want with me ? '
Parsing [sent. 8953 len. 4]: said Mr Abel .
Parsing [sent. 8954 len. 9]: ` How did you come here ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8955 len. 10]: I got in behind , ' replied the Marchioness .
Parsing [sent. 8956 len. 21]: ` Oh please drive on , sir -- do n't stop -- and go towards the City , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 8957 len. 13]: And oh do please make haste , because it 's of consequence .
Parsing [sent. 8958 len. 9]: There 's somebody wants to see you there .
Parsing [sent. 8959 len. 30]: He sent me to say would you come directly , and that he knowed all about Kit , and could save him yet , and prove his innocence . '
Parsing [sent. 8960 len. 10]: ` What do you tell me , child ? '
Parsing [sent. 8961 len. 12]: ` The truth , upon my word and honour I do .
Parsing [sent. 8962 len. 10]: But please to drive on -- quick , please !
Parsing [sent. 8963 len. 16]: I 've been such a time gone , he 'll think I 'm lost . '
Parsing [sent. 8964 len. 8]: Mr Abel involuntarily urged the pony forward .
Parsing [sent. 8965 len. 59]: The pony , impelled by some secret sympathy or some new caprice , burst into a great pace , and neither slackened it , nor indulged in any eccentric performances , until they arrived at the door of Mr Swiveller 's lodging , where , marvellous to relate , he consented to stop when Mr Abel checked him .
Parsing [sent. 8966 len. 3]: ` See !
Parsing [sent. 8967 len. 22]: It 's the room up there , ' said the Marchioness , pointing to one where there was a faint light .
Parsing [sent. 8968 len. 4]: ` Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 8969 len. 64]: Mr Abel , who was one of the simplest and most retiring creatures in existence , and naturally timid withal , hesitated ; for he had heard of people being decoyed into strange places to be robbed and murdered , under circumstances very like the present , and , for anything he knew to the contrary , by guides very like the Marchioness .
Parsing [sent. 8970 len. 12]: His regard for Kit , however , overcame every other consideration .
Parsing [sent. 8971 len. 41]: So , entrusting Whisker to the charge of a man who was lingering hard by in expectation of the Job , he suffered his companion to take his hand , and to lead him up the dark and narrow stairs .
Parsing [sent. 8972 len. 25]: He was not a little surprised to find himself conducted into a dimly-lighted sick chamber , where a man was sleeping tranquilly in bed .
Parsing [sent. 8973 len. 14]: ` A n't it nice to see him lying there so quiet ? '
Parsing [sent. 8974 len. 9]: said his guide , in an earnest whisper .
Parsing [sent. 8975 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8976 len. 19]: you 'd say it was , if you had only seen him two or three days ago . '
Parsing [sent. 8977 len. 26]: Mr Abel made no answer , and , to say the truth , kept a long way from the bed and very near the door .
Parsing [sent. 8978 len. 25]: His guide , who appeared to understand his reluctance , trimmed the candle , and taking it in her hand , approached the bed .
Parsing [sent. 8979 len. 23]: As she did so , the sleeper started up , and he recognised in the wasted face the features of Richard Swiveller .
Parsing [sent. 8980 len. 8]: ` Why , how is this ? '
Parsing [sent. 8981 len. 11]: said Mr Abel kindly , as he hurried towards him .
Parsing [sent. 8982 len. 7]: ` You have been ill ? '
Parsing [sent. 8983 len. 7]: ` Very , ' replied Dick .
Parsing [sent. 8984 len. 4]: ` Nearly dead .
Parsing [sent. 8985 len. 23]: You might have chanced to hear of your Richard on his bier , but for the friend I sent to fetch you .
Parsing [sent. 8986 len. 12]: Another shake of the hand , Marchioness , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 8987 len. 6]: Sit down , Sir . '
Parsing [sent. 8988 len. 23]: Mr Abel seemed rather astonished to hear of the quality of his guide , and took a chair by the bedside . '
Parsing [sent. 8989 len. 22]: I have sent for you , Sir , ' said Dick -- ` but she told you on what account ? '
Parsing [sent. 8990 len. 4]: ` She did .
Parsing [sent. 8991 len. 8]: I am quite bewildered by all this .
Parsing [sent. 8992 len. 16]: I really do n't know what to say or think , ' replied Mr Abel .
Parsing [sent. 8993 len. 11]: ` You 'll say that presently , ' retorted Dick .
Parsing [sent. 8994 len. 13]: ` Marchioness , take a seat on the bed , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 8995 len. 15]: Now , tell this gentleman all that you told me ; and be particular .
Parsing [sent. 8996 len. 10]: Do n't you speak another word , Sir . '
Parsing [sent. 8997 len. 23]: The story was repeated ; it was , in effect , exactly the same as before , without any deviation or omission .
Parsing [sent. 8998 len. 24]: Richard Swiveller kept his eyes fixed on his visitor during its narration , and directly it was concluded , took the word again .
Parsing [sent. 8999 len. 14]: ` You have heard it all , and you 'll not forget it .
Parsing [sent. 9000 len. 22]: I 'm too giddy and too queer to suggest anything ; but you and your friends will know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 9001 len. 11]: After this long delay , every minute is an age .
Parsing [sent. 9002 len. 15]: If ever you went home fast in your life , go home fast to-night .
Parsing [sent. 9003 len. 13]: Do n't stop to say one word to me , but go .
Parsing [sent. 9004 len. 32]: She will be found here , whenever she 's wanted ; and as to me , you 're pretty sure to find me at home , for a week or two .
Parsing [sent. 9005 len. 9]: There are more reasons than one for that .
Parsing [sent. 9006 len. 5]: Marchioness , a light !
Parsing [sent. 9007 len. 19]: If you lose another minute in looking at me , sir , I 'll never forgive you ! '
Parsing [sent. 9008 len. 9]: Mr Abel needed no more remonstrance or persuasion .
Parsing [sent. 9009 len. 35]: He was gone in an instant ; and the Marchioness , returning from lighting him down-stairs , reported that the pony , without any preliminary objection whatever , had dashed away at full gallop .
Parsing [sent. 9010 len. 6]: ` That 's right ! '
Parsing [sent. 9011 len. 17]: said Dick ; ` and hearty of him ; and I honour him from this time .
Parsing [sent. 9012 len. 19]: But get some supper and a mug of beer , for I am sure you must be tired .
Parsing [sent. 9013 len. 7]: Do have a mug of beer .
Parsing [sent. 9014 len. 21]: It will do me as much good to see you take it as if I might drink it myself . '
Parsing [sent. 9015 len. 18]: Nothing but this assurance could have prevailed upon the small nurse to indulge in such a luxury .
Parsing [sent. 9016 len. 40]: Having eaten and drunk to Mr Swiveller 's extreme contentment , given him his drink , and put everything in neat order , she wrapped herself in an old coverlet and lay down upon the rug before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 9017 len. 23]: Mr Swiveller was by that time murmuring in his sleep , ` Strew then , oh strew , a bed of rushes .
Parsing [sent. 9018 len. 9]: Here will we stay , till morning blushes .
Parsing [sent. 9019 len. 6]: Good night , Marchioness ! '
Parsing [sent. 9020 len. 24]: Chapter 66 On awaking in the morning , Richard Swiveller became conscious , by slow degrees , of whispering voices in his room .
Parsing [sent. 9021 len. 49]: Looking out between the curtains , he espied Mr Garland , Mr Abel , the notary , and the single gentleman , gathered round the Marchioness , and talking to her with great earnestness but in very subdued tones -- fearing , no doubt , to disturb him .
Parsing [sent. 9022 len. 23]: He lost no time in letting them know that this precaution was unnecessary , and all four gentlemen directly approached his bedside .
Parsing [sent. 9023 len. 18]: Old Mr Garland was the first to stretch out his hand , and inquire how he felt .
Parsing [sent. 9024 len. 67]: Dick was about to answer that he felt much better , though still as weak as need be , when his little nurse , pushing the visitors aside and pressing up to his pillow as if in jealousy of their interference , set his breakfast before him , and insisted on his taking it before he underwent the fatigue of speaking or of being spoken to .
Parsing [sent. 9025 len. 54]: Mr Swiveller , who was perfectly ravenous , and had had , all night , amazingly distinct and consistent dreams of mutton chops , double stout , and similar delicacies , felt even the weak tea and dry toast such irresistible temptations , that he consented to eat and drink on one condition .
Parsing [sent. 9026 len. 35]: ` And that is , ' said Dick , returning the pressure of Mr Garland 's hand , ` that you answer me this question truly , before I take a bit or drop .
Parsing [sent. 9027 len. 6]: Is it too late ? '
Parsing [sent. 9028 len. 13]: ` For completing the work you began so well last night ? '
Parsing [sent. 9029 len. 5]: returned the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 9030 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 9031 len. 9]: Set your mind at rest on that point .
Parsing [sent. 9032 len. 9]: It is not , I assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 9033 len. 38]: Comforted by this intelligence , the patient applied himself to his food with a keen appetite , though evidently not with a greater zest in the eating than his nurse appeared to have in seeing him eat .
Parsing [sent. 9034 len. 92]: The manner of this meal was this : -- Mr Swiveller , holding the slice of toast or cup of tea in his left hand , and taking a bite or drink , as the case might be , constantly kept , in his right , one palm of the Marchioness tight locked ; and to shake , or even to kiss this imprisoned hand , he would stop every now and then , in the very act of swallowing , with perfect seriousness of intention , and the utmost gravity .
Parsing [sent. 9035 len. 52]: As often as he put anything into his mouth , whether for eating or drinking , the face of the Marchioness lighted up beyond all description ; but whenever he gave her one or other of these tokens of recognition , her countenance became overshadowed , and she began to sob .
Parsing [sent. 9036 len. 47]: Now , whether she was in her laughing joy , or in her crying one , the Marchioness could not help turning to the visitors with an appealing look , which seemed to say , ` You see this fellow -- can I help this ? '
Parsing [sent. 9037 len. 27]: -- and they , being thus made , as it were , parties to the scene , as regularly answered by another look , ` No .
Parsing [sent. 9038 len. 4]: Certainly not . '
Parsing [sent. 9039 len. 70]: This dumb-show , taking place during the whole time of the invalid 's breakfast , and the invalid himself , pale and emaciated , performing no small part in the same , it may be fairly questioned whether at any meal , where no word , good or bad , was spoken from beginning to end , so much was expressed by gestures in themselves so slight and unimportant .
Parsing [sent. 9040 len. 36]: At length -- and to say the truth before very long -- Mr Swiveller had despatched as much toast and tea as in that stage of his recovery it was discreet to let him have .
Parsing [sent. 9041 len. 83]: But the cares of the Marchioness did not stop here ; for , disappearing for an instant and presently returning with a basin of fair water , she laved his face and hands , brushed his hair , and in short made him as spruce and smart as anybody under such circumstances could be made ; and all this , in as brisk and business-like a manner , as if he were a very little boy , and she his grown-up nurse .
Parsing [sent. 9042 len. 20]: To these various attentions , Mr Swiveller submitted in a kind of grateful astonishment beyond the reach of language .
Parsing [sent. 9043 len. 51]: When they were at last brought to an end , and the Marchioness had withdrawn into a distant corner to take her own poor breakfast -LRB- cold enough by that time -RRB- , he turned his face away for some few moments , and shook hands heartily with the air .
Parsing [sent. 9044 len. 24]: ` Gentlemen , ' said Dick , rousing himself from this pause , and turning round again , ` you 'll excuse me .
Parsing [sent. 9045 len. 16]: Men who have been brought so low as I have been , are easily fatigued .
Parsing [sent. 9046 len. 11]: I am fresh again now , and fit for talking .
Parsing [sent. 9047 len. 35]: We 're short of chairs here , among other trifles , but if you 'll do me the favour to sit upon the bed -- ' ` What can we do for you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9048 len. 6]: said Mr Garland , kindly .
Parsing [sent. 9049 len. 33]: ` if you could make the Marchioness yonder , a Marchioness , in real , sober earnest , ' returned Dick , ` I 'd thank you to get it done off-hand .
Parsing [sent. 9050 len. 46]: But as you ca n't , and as the question is not what you will do for me , but what you will do for somebody else who has a better claim upon you , pray sir let me know what you intend doing . '
Parsing [sent. 9051 len. 29]: ` It 's chiefly on that account that we have come just now , ' said the single gentleman , ` for you will have another visitor presently .
Parsing [sent. 9052 len. 31]: We feared you would be anxious unless you knew from ourselves what steps we intended to take , and therefore came to you before we stirred in the matter . '
Parsing [sent. 9053 len. 12]: ` Gentlemen , ' returned Dick , ' I thank you .
Parsing [sent. 9054 len. 15]: Anybody in the helpless state that you see me in , is naturally anxious .
Parsing [sent. 9055 len. 10]: Do n't let me interrupt you , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 9056 len. 45]: ` Then , you see , my good fellow , ' said the single gentleman , ` that while we have no doubt whatever of the truth of this disclosure , which has so providentially come to light -- ' ` Meaning hers ? '
Parsing [sent. 9057 len. 9]: said Dick , pointing towards the Marchioness . '
Parsing [sent. 9058 len. 7]: -- Meaning hers , of course .
Parsing [sent. 9059 len. 51]: While we have no doubt of that , or that a proper use of it would procure the poor lad 's immediate pardon and liberation , we have a great doubt whether it would , by itself , enable us to reach Quilp , the chief agent in this villany .
Parsing [sent. 9060 len. 38]: I should tell you that this doubt has been confirmed into something very nearly approaching certainty by the best opinions we have been enabled , in this short space of time , to take upon the subject .
Parsing [sent. 9061 len. 28]: You 'll agree with us , that to give him even the most distant chance of escape , if we could help it , would be monstrous .
Parsing [sent. 9062 len. 22]: You say with us , no doubt , if somebody must escape , let it be any one but he . '
Parsing [sent. 9063 len. 10]: ` Yes , ' returned Dick , ` certainly .
Parsing [sent. 9064 len. 18]: That is if somebody must -- but upon my word , I 'm unwilling that Anybody should .
Parsing [sent. 9065 len. 35]: Since laws were made for every degree , to curb vice in others as well as in me -- and so forth you know -- does n't it strike you in that light ? '
Parsing [sent. 9066 len. 55]: The single gentleman smiled as if the light in which Mr Swiveller had put the question were not the clearest in the world , and proceeded to explain that they contemplated proceeding by stratagem in the first instance ; and that their design was to endeavour to extort a confession from the gentle Sarah .
Parsing [sent. 9067 len. 49]: ` When she finds how much we know , and how we know it , ' he said , ` and that she is clearly compromised already , we are not without strong hopes that we may be enabled through her means to punish the other two effectually .
Parsing [sent. 9068 len. 16]: If we could do that , she might go scot-free for aught I cared . '
Parsing [sent. 9069 len. 96]: Dick received this project in anything but a gracious manner , representing with as much warmth as he was then capable of showing , that they would find the old buck -LRB- meaning Sarah -RRB- more difficult to manage than Quilp himself -- that , for any tampering , terrifying , or cajolery , she was a very unpromising and unyielding subject -- that she was of a kind of brass not easily melted or moulded into shape -- in short , that they were no match for her , and would be signally defeated .
Parsing [sent. 9070 len. 14]: But it was in vain to urge them to adopt some other course .
Parsing [sent. 9071 len. 104]: The single gentleman has been described as explaining their joint intentions , but it should have been written that they all spoke together ; that if any one of them by chance held his peace for a moment , he stood gasping and panting for an opportunity to strike in again : in a word , that they had reached that pitch of impatience and anxiety where men can neither be persuaded nor reasoned with ; and that it would have been as easy to turn the most impetuous wind that ever blew , as to prevail on them to reconsider their determination .
Parsing [sent. 9072 len. 164]: So , after telling Mr Swiveller how they had not lost sight of Kit 's mother and the children ; how they had never once even lost sight of Kit himself , but had been unremitting in their endeavours to procure a mitigation of his sentence ; how they had been perfectly distracted between the strong proofs of his guilt , and their own fading hopes of his innocence ; and how he , Richard Swiveller , might keep his mind at rest , for everything should be happily adjusted between that time and night ; -- after telling him all this , and adding a great many kind and cordial expressions , personal to himself , which it is unnecessary to recite , Mr Garland , the notary , and the single gentleman , took their leaves at a very critical time , or Richard Swiveller must assuredly have been driven into another fever , whereof the results might have been fatal .
Parsing [sent. 9073 len. 67]: Mr Abel remained behind , very often looking at his watch and at the room door , until Mr Swiveller was roused from a short nap , by the setting-down on the landing-place outside , as from the shoulders of a porter , of some giant load , which seemed to shake the house , and made the little physic bottles on the mantel-shelf ring again .
Parsing [sent. 9074 len. 25]: Directly this sound reached his ears , Mr Abel started up , and hobbled to the door , and opened it ; and behold !
Parsing [sent. 9075 len. 116]: there stood a strong man , with a mighty hamper , which , being hauled into the room and presently unpacked , disgorged such treasures as tea , and coffee , and wine , and rusks , and oranges , and grapes , and fowls ready trussed for boiling , and calves ' - foot jelly , and arrow-root , and sago , and other delicate restoratives , that the small servant , who had never thought it possible that such things could be , except in shops , stood rooted to the spot in her one shoe , with her mouth and eyes watering in unison , and her power of speech quite gone .
Parsing [sent. 9076 len. 138]: But , not so Mr Abel ; or the strong man who emptied the hamper , big as it was , in a twinkling ; and not so the nice old lady , who appeared so suddenly that she might have come out of the hamper too -LRB- it was quite large enough -RRB- , and who , bustling about on tiptoe and without noise -- now here , now there , now everywhere at once -- began to fill out the jelly in tea-cups , and to make chicken broth in small saucepans , and to peel oranges for the sick man and to cut them up in little pieces , and to ply the small servant with glasses of wine and choice bits of everything until more substantial meat could be prepared for her refreshment .
Parsing [sent. 9077 len. 71]: The whole of which appearances were so unexpected and bewildering , that Mr Swiveller , when he had taken two oranges and a little jelly , and had seen the strong man walk off with the empty basket , plainly leaving all that abundance for his use and benefit , was fain to lie down and fall asleep again , from sheer inability to entertain such wonders in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 9078 len. 63]: Meanwhile , the single gentleman , the Notary , and Mr Garland , repaired to a certain coffee-house , and from that place indited and sent a letter to Miss Sally Brass , requesting her , in terms mysterious and brief , to favour an unknown friend who wished to consult her , with her company there , as speedily as possible .
Parsing [sent. 9079 len. 29]: The communication performed its errand so well , that within ten minutes of the messenger 's return and report of its delivery , Miss Brass herself was announced .
Parsing [sent. 9080 len. 24]: ` Pray ma'am , ' said the single gentleman , whom she found alone in the room , ` take a chair . '
Parsing [sent. 9081 len. 42]: Miss Brass sat herself down , in a very stiff and frigid state , and seemed -- as indeed she was -- not a little astonished to find that the lodger and her mysterious correspondent were one and the same person .
Parsing [sent. 9082 len. 10]: ` You did not expect to see me ? '
Parsing [sent. 9083 len. 6]: said the single gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 9084 len. 14]: I did n't think much about it , ' returned the beauty . '
Parsing [sent. 9085 len. 11]: I supposed it was business of some kind or other .
Parsing [sent. 9086 len. 23]: If it 's about the apartments , of course you 'll give my brother regular notice , you know -- or money .
Parsing [sent. 9087 len. 6]: That 's very easily settled .
Parsing [sent. 9088 len. 24]: You 're a responsible party , and in such a case lawful money and lawful notice are pretty much the same . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9089 len. 24]: I am obliged to you for your good opinion , ' retorted the single gentleman , ` and quite concur in these sentiments .
Parsing [sent. 9090 len. 16]: But that is not the subject on which I wish to speak with you . '
Parsing [sent. 9091 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 9092 len. 3]: said Sally .
Parsing [sent. 9093 len. 10]: ` Then just state the particulars , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 9094 len. 8]: I suppose it 's professional business ? '
Parsing [sent. 9095 len. 13]: ` Why , it is connected with the law , certainly . '
Parsing [sent. 9096 len. 9]: ` Very well , ' returned Miss Brass .
Parsing [sent. 9097 len. 10]: ` My brother and I are just the same .
Parsing [sent. 9098 len. 13]: I can take any instructions , or give you any advice . '
Parsing [sent. 9099 len. 33]: ` As there are other parties interested besides myself , ' said the single gentleman , rising and opening the door of an inner room , ` we had better confer together .
Parsing [sent. 9100 len. 8]: Miss Brass is here , gentlemen . '
Parsing [sent. 9101 len. 45]: Mr Garland and the Notary walked in , looking very grave ; and , drawing up two chairs , one on each side of the single gentleman , formed a kind of fence round the gentle Sarah , and penned her into a corner .
Parsing [sent. 9102 len. 35]: Her brother Sampson under such circumstances would certainly have evinced some confusion or anxiety , but she -- all composure -- pulled out the tin box , and calmly took a pinch of snuff .
Parsing [sent. 9103 len. 43]: ` Miss Brass , ' said the Notary , taking the word at this crisis , ` we professional people understand each other , and , when we choose , can say what we have to say , in very few words .
Parsing [sent. 9104 len. 11]: You advertised a runaway servant , the other day ? '
Parsing [sent. 9105 len. 22]: ` Well , ' returned Miss Sally , with a sudden flush overspreading her features , ` what of that ? '
Parsing [sent. 9106 len. 20]: ` She is found , ma'am , ' said the Notary , pulling out his pocket-handkerchief with a flourish .
Parsing [sent. 9107 len. 6]: ` She is found . '
Parsing [sent. 9108 len. 6]: ` Who found her ? '
Parsing [sent. 9109 len. 4]: demanded Sarah hastily .
Parsing [sent. 9110 len. 9]: ` We did , ma'am -- we three .
Parsing [sent. 9111 len. 14]: Only last night , or you would have heard from us before . '
Parsing [sent. 9112 len. 37]: ` And now I have heard from you , ' said Miss Brass , folding her arms as though she were about to deny something to the death , ` what have you got to say ?
Parsing [sent. 9113 len. 13]: Something you have got into your heads about her , of course .
Parsing [sent. 9114 len. 10]: Prove it , will you -- that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 9115 len. 3]: Prove it .
Parsing [sent. 9116 len. 8]: You have found her , you say .
Parsing [sent. 9117 len. 32]: I can tell you -LRB- if you do n't know it -RRB- that you have found the most artful , lying , pilfering , devilish little minx that was ever born .
Parsing [sent. 9118 len. 8]: -- Have you got her here ? '
Parsing [sent. 9119 len. 7]: she added , looking sharply round .
Parsing [sent. 9120 len. 15]: ` No , she is not here at present , ' returned the Notary .
Parsing [sent. 9121 len. 8]: ` But she is quite safe . '
Parsing [sent. 9122 len. 4]: ` Ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 9123 len. 48]: cried Sally , twitching a pinch of snuff out of her box , as spitefully as if she were in the very act of wrenching off the small servant 's nose ; ` she shall be safe enough from this time , I warrant you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9124 len. 9]: I hope so , ' replied the Notary .
Parsing [sent. 9125 len. 30]: ` Did it occur to you for the first time , when you found she had run away , that there were two keys to your kitchen door ? '
Parsing [sent. 9126 len. 38]: Miss Sally took another pinch , and putting her head on one side , looked at her questioner , with a curious kind of spasm about her mouth , but with a cunning aspect of immense expression .
Parsing [sent. 9127 len. 127]: ` Two keys , ' repeated the Notary ; ` one of which gave her the opportunities of roaming through the house at nights when you supposed her fast locked up , and of overhearing confidential consultations -- among others , that particular conference , to be described to-day before a justice , which you will have an opportunity of hearing her relate ; that conference which you and Mr Brass held together , on the night before that most unfortunate and innocent young man was accused of robbery , by a horrible device of which I will only say that it may be characterised by the epithets which you have applied to this wretched little witness , and by a few stronger ones besides . '
Parsing [sent. 9128 len. 5]: Sally took another pinch .
Parsing [sent. 9129 len. 43]: Although her face was wonderfully composed , it was apparent that she was wholly taken by surprise , and that what she had expected to be taxed with , in connection with her small servant , was something very different from this .
Parsing [sent. 9130 len. 55]: ` Come , come , Miss Brass , ' said the Notary , ` you have great command of feature , but you feel , I see , that by a chance which never entered your imagination , this base design is revealed , and two of its plotters must be brought to justice .
Parsing [sent. 9131 len. 32]: Now , you know the pains and penalties you are liable to , and so I need not dilate upon them , but I have a proposal to make to you .
Parsing [sent. 9132 len. 38]: You have the honour of being sister to one of the greatest scoundrels unhung ; and , if I may venture to say so to a lady , you are in every respect quite worthy of him .
Parsing [sent. 9133 len. 36]: But connected with you two is a third party , a villain of the name of Quilp , the prime mover of the whole diabolical device , who I believe to be worse than either .
Parsing [sent. 9134 len. 20]: For his sake , Miss Brass , do us the favour to reveal the whole history of this affair .
Parsing [sent. 9135 len. 54]: Let me remind you that your doing so , at our instance , will place you in a safe and comfortable position -- your present one is not desirable -- and can not injure your brother ; for against him and you we have quite sufficient evidence -LRB- as you hear -RRB- already .
Parsing [sent. 9136 len. 58]: I will not say to you that we suggest this course in mercy -LRB- for , to tell you the truth , we do not entertain any regard for you -RRB- , but it is a necessity to which we are reduced , and I recommend it to you as a matter of the very best policy .
Parsing [sent. 9137 len. 23]: Time , ' said Mr Witherden , pulling out his watch , ` in a business like this , is exceedingly precious .
Parsing [sent. 9138 len. 13]: Favour us with your decision as speedily as possible , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 9139 len. 53]: With a smile upon her face , and looking at each of the three by turns , Miss Brass took two or three more pinches of snuff , and having by this time very little left , travelled round and round the box with her forefinger and thumb , scraping up another .
Parsing [sent. 9140 len. 32]: Having disposed of this likewise and put the box carefully in her pocket , she said , -- ' I am to accept or reject at once , am I ? '
Parsing [sent. 9141 len. 8]: ` Yes , ' said Mr Witherden .
Parsing [sent. 9142 len. 32]: The charming creature was opening her lips to speak in reply , when the door was hastily opened too , and the head of Sampson Brass was thrust into the room .
Parsing [sent. 9143 len. 10]: ` Excuse me , ' said the gentleman hastily .
Parsing [sent. 9144 len. 6]: ` Wait a bit ! '
Parsing [sent. 9145 len. 41]: So saying , and quite indifferent to the astonishment his presence occasioned , he crept in , shut the door , kissed his greasy glove as servilely as if it were the dust , and made a most abject bow .
Parsing [sent. 9146 len. 20]: ` Sarah , ' said Brass , ` hold your tongue if you please , and let me speak .
Parsing [sent. 9147 len. 35]: Gentlemen , if I could express the pleasure it gives me to see three such men in a happy unity of feeling and concord of sentiment , I think you would hardly believe me .
Parsing [sent. 9148 len. 35]: But though I am unfortunate -- nay , gentlemen , criminal , if we are to use harsh expressions in a company like this -- still , I have my feelings like other men .
Parsing [sent. 9149 len. 18]: I have heard of a poet , who remarked that feelings were the common lot of all .
Parsing [sent. 9150 len. 24]: If he could have been a pig , gentlemen , and have uttered that sentiment , he would still have been immortal . '
Parsing [sent. 9151 len. 20]: ` If you 're not an idiot , ' said Miss Brass harshly , ` hold your peace . '
Parsing [sent. 9152 len. 15]: ` Sarah , my dear , ' returned her brother , ` thank you .
Parsing [sent. 9153 len. 21]: But I know what I am about , my love , and will take the liberty of expressing myself accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 9154 len. 41]: Mr Witherden , Sir , your handkerchief is hanging out of your pocket -- would you allow me to -- , As Mr Brass advanced to remedy this accident , the Notary shrunk from him with an air of disgust .
Parsing [sent. 9155 len. 40]: Brass , who over and above his usual prepossessing qualities , had a scratched face , a green shade over one eye , and a hat grievously crushed , stopped short , and looked round with a pitiful smile .
Parsing [sent. 9156 len. 28]: ` He shuns me , ' said Sampson , ` even when I would , as I may say , heap coals of fire upon his head .
Parsing [sent. 9157 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 9158 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 9159 len. 34]: But I am a falling house , and the rats -LRB- if I may be allowed the expression in reference to a gentleman I respect and love beyond everything -RRB- fly from me !
Parsing [sent. 9160 len. 38]: Gentlemen -- regarding your conversation just now , I happened to see my sister on her way here , and , wondering where she could be going to , and being -- may I venture to say ?
Parsing [sent. 9161 len. 10]: -- naturally of a suspicious turn , followed her .
Parsing [sent. 9162 len. 9]: Since then , I have been listening . '
Parsing [sent. 9163 len. 22]: ` If you 're not mad , ' interposed Miss Sally , ` stop there , and say no more . '
Parsing [sent. 9164 len. 24]: ` Sarah , my dear , ' rejoined Brass with undiminished politeness , ' I thank you kindly , but will still proceed .
Parsing [sent. 9165 len. 63]: Mr Witherden , sir , as we have the honour to be members of the same profession -- to say nothing of that other gentleman having been my lodger , and having partaken , as one may say , of the hospitality of my roof -- I think you might have given me the refusal of this offer in the first instance .
Parsing [sent. 9166 len. 4]: I do indeed .
Parsing [sent. 9167 len. 30]: Now , my dear Sir , ' cried Brass , seeing that the Notary was about to interrupt him , ` suffer me to speak , I beg . '
Parsing [sent. 9168 len. 10]: Mr Witherden was silent , and Brass went on .
Parsing [sent. 9169 len. 49]: ` If you will do me the favour , ' he said , holding up the green shade , and revealing an eye most horribly discoloured , ` to look at this , you will naturally inquire , in your own minds , how did I get it .
Parsing [sent. 9170 len. 24]: If you look from that , to my face , you will wonder what could have been the cause of all these scratches .
Parsing [sent. 9171 len. 20]: And if from them to my hat , how it came into the state in which you see it .
Parsing [sent. 9172 len. 26]: Gentlemen , ' said Brass , striking the hat fiercely with his clenched hand , ` to all these questions I answer -- Quilp ! '
Parsing [sent. 9173 len. 13]: The three gentlemen looked at each other , but said nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 9174 len. 126]: I say , ' pursued Brass , glancing aside at his sister , as though he were talking for her information , and speaking with a snarling malignity , in violent contrast to his usual smoothness , ` that I answer to all these questions , -- Quilp -- Quilp , who deludes me into his infernal den , and takes a delight in looking on and chuckling while I scorch , and burn , and bruise , and maim myself -- Quilp , who never once , no never once , in all our communications together , has treated me otherwise than as a dog -- Quilp , whom I have always hated with my whole heart , but never so much as lately .
Parsing [sent. 9175 len. 30]: He gives me the cold shoulder on this very matter as if he had had nothing to do with it , instead of being the first to propose it .
Parsing [sent. 9176 len. 6]: I ca n't trust him .
Parsing [sent. 9177 len. 37]: In one of his howling , raving , blazing humours , I believe he 'd let it out , if it was murder , and never think of himself so long as he could terrify me .
Parsing [sent. 9178 len. 39]: Now , ' said Brass , picking up his hat again and replacing the shade over his eye , and actually crouching down , in the excess of his servility , ` What does all this lead to ?
Parsing [sent. 9179 len. 12]: -- what should you say it led me to , gentlemen ?
Parsing [sent. 9180 len. 11]: -- could you guess at all near the mark ? '
Parsing [sent. 9181 len. 3]: Nobody spoke .
Parsing [sent. 9182 len. 36]: Brass stood smirking for a little while , as if he had propounded some choice conundrum ; and then said : ` To be short with you , then , it leads me to this .
Parsing [sent. 9183 len. 79]: If the truth has come out , as it plainly has in a manner that there 's no standing up against -- and a very sublime and grand thing is Truth , gentlemen , in its way , though like other sublime and grand things , such as thunder-storms and that , we 're not always over and above glad to see it -- I had better turn upon this man than let this man turn upon me .
Parsing [sent. 9184 len. 11]: It 's clear to me that I am done for .
Parsing [sent. 9185 len. 21]: Therefore , if anybody is to split , I had better be the person and have the advantage of it .
Parsing [sent. 9186 len. 11]: Sarah , my dear , comparatively speaking you 're safe .
Parsing [sent. 9187 len. 10]: I relate these circumstances for my own profit . '
Parsing [sent. 9188 len. 49]: With that , Mr Brass , in a great hurry , revealed the whole story ; bearing as heavily as possible on his amiable employer , and making himself out to be rather a saint-like and holy character , though subject -- he acknowledged -- to human weaknesses .
Parsing [sent. 9189 len. 20]: He concluded thus : ` Now , gentlemen , I am not a man who does things by halves .
Parsing [sent. 9190 len. 22]: Being in for a penny , I am ready , as the saying is , to be in for a pound .
Parsing [sent. 9191 len. 16]: You must do with me what you please , and take me where you please .
Parsing [sent. 9192 len. 17]: If you wish to have this in writing , we 'll reduce it into manuscript immediately .
Parsing [sent. 9193 len. 11]: You will be tender with me , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 9194 len. 11]: I am quite confident you will be tender with me .
Parsing [sent. 9195 len. 11]: You are men of honour , and have feeling hearts .
Parsing [sent. 9196 len. 19]: I yielded from necessity to Quilp , for though necessity has no law , she has her lawyers .
Parsing [sent. 9197 len. 27]: I yield to you from necessity too ; from policy besides ; and because of feelings that have been a pretty long time working within me .
Parsing [sent. 9198 len. 5]: Punish Quilp , gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 9199 len. 5]: Weigh heavily upon him .
Parsing [sent. 9200 len. 4]: Grind him down .
Parsing [sent. 9201 len. 5]: Tread him under foot .
Parsing [sent. 9202 len. 16]: He has done as much by me , for many and many a day . '
Parsing [sent. 9203 len. 32]: Having now arrived at the conclusion of his discourse , Sampson checked the current of his wrath , kissed his glove again , and smiled as only parasites and cowards can .
Parsing [sent. 9204 len. 45]: ` And this , ' said Miss Brass , raising her head , with which she had hitherto sat resting on her hands , and surveying him from head to foot with a bitter sneer , ` this is my brother , is it !
Parsing [sent. 9205 len. 26]: This is my brother , that I have worked and toiled for , and believed to have had something of the man in him ! '
Parsing [sent. 9206 len. 20]: ` Sarah , my dear , ' returned Sampson , rubbing his hands feebly ; you disturb our friends .
Parsing [sent. 9207 len. 21]: Besides you -- you 're disappointed , Sarah , and , not knowing what you say , expose yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 9208 len. 18]: ` Yes , you pitiful dastard , ' retorted the lovely damsel , ' I understand you .
Parsing [sent. 9209 len. 10]: You feared that I should be beforehand with you .
Parsing [sent. 9210 len. 15]: But do you think that I would have been enticed to say a word !
Parsing [sent. 9211 len. 18]: I 'd have scorned it , if they had tried and tempted me for twenty years . '
Parsing [sent. 9212 len. 5]: ` He he ! '
Parsing [sent. 9213 len. 36]: simpered Brass , who , in his deep debasement , really seemed to have changed sexes with his sister , and to have made over to her any spark of manliness he might have possessed .
Parsing [sent. 9214 len. 24]: ` You think so , Sarah , you think so perhaps ; but you would have acted quite different , my good fellow .
Parsing [sent. 9215 len. 25]: You will not have forgotten that it was a maxim with Foxey -- our revered father , gentlemen -- `` Always suspect everybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 9216 len. 10]: That 's the maxim to go through life with !
Parsing [sent. 9217 len. 27]: If you were not actually about to purchase your own safety when I showed myself , I suspect you 'd have done it by this time .
Parsing [sent. 9218 len. 19]: And therefore I 've done it myself , and spared you the trouble as well as the shame .
Parsing [sent. 9219 len. 25]: The shame , gentlemen , ' added Brass , allowing himself to be slightly overcome , ` if there is any , is mine .
Parsing [sent. 9220 len. 12]: It 's better that a female should be spared it . '
Parsing [sent. 9221 len. 62]: With deference to the better opinion of Mr Brass , and more particularly to the authority of his Great Ancestor , it may be doubted , with humility , whether the elevating principle laid down by the latter gentleman , and acted upon by his descendant , is always a prudent one , or attended in practice with the desired results .
Parsing [sent. 9222 len. 58]: This is , beyond question , a bold and presumptuous doubt , inasmuch as many distinguished characters , called men of the world , long-headed customers , knowing dogs , shrewd fellows , capital hands at business , and the like , have made , and do daily make , this axiom their polar star and compass .
Parsing [sent. 9223 len. 9]: Still , the doubt may be gently insinuated .
Parsing [sent. 9224 len. 81]: And in illustration it may be observed , that if Mr Brass , not being over-suspicious , had , without prying and listening , left his sister to manage the conference on their joint behalf , or prying and listening , had not been in such a mighty hurry to anticipate her -LRB- which he would not have been , but for his distrust and jealousy -RRB- , he would probably have found himself much better off in the end .
Parsing [sent. 9225 len. 61]: Thus , it will always happen that these men of the world , who go through it in armour , defend themselves from quite as much good as evil ; to say nothing of the inconvenience and absurdity of mounting guard with a microscope at all times , and of wearing a coat of mail on the most innocent occasions .
Parsing [sent. 9226 len. 12]: The three gentlemen spoke together apart , for a few moments .
Parsing [sent. 9227 len. 46]: At the end of their consultation , which was very brief , the Notary pointed to the writing materials on the table , and informed Mr Brass that if he wished to make any statement in writing , he had the opportunity of doing so .
Parsing [sent. 9228 len. 44]: At the same time he felt bound to tell him that they would require his attendance , presently , before a justice of the peace , and that in what he did or said , he was guided entirely by his own discretion .
Parsing [sent. 9229 len. 75]: ` Gentlemen , ' said Brass , drawing off his glove , and crawling in spirit upon the ground before them , ' I will justify the tenderness with which I know I shall be treated ; and as , without tenderness , I should , now that this discovery has been made , stand in the worst position of the three , you may depend upon it I will make a clean breast .
Parsing [sent. 9230 len. 54]: Mr Witherden , sir , a kind of faintness is upon my spirits -- if you would do me the favour to ring the bell and order up a glass of something warm and spicy , I shall , notwithstanding what has passed , have a melancholy pleasure in drinking your good health .
Parsing [sent. 9231 len. 42]: I had hoped , ' said Brass , looking round with a mournful smile , ` to have seen you three gentlemen , one day or another , with your legs under the mahogany in my humble parlour in the Marks .
Parsing [sent. 9232 len. 5]: But hopes are fleeting .
Parsing [sent. 9233 len. 4]: Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 9234 len. 25]: Mr Brass found himself so exceedingly affected , at this point , that he could say or do nothing more until some refreshment arrived .
Parsing [sent. 9235 len. 20]: Having partaken of it , pretty freely for one in his agitated state , he sat down to write .
Parsing [sent. 9236 len. 45]: The lovely Sarah , now with her arms folded , and now with her hands clasped behind her , paced the room with manly strides while her brother was thus employed , and sometimes stopped to pull out her snuff-box and bite the lid .
Parsing [sent. 9237 len. 24]: She continued to pace up and down until she was quite tired , and then fell asleep on a chair near the door .
Parsing [sent. 9238 len. 33]: It has been since supposed , with some reason , that this slumber was a sham or feint , as she contrived to slip away unobserved in the dusk of the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 9239 len. 43]: Whether this was an intentional and waking departure , or a somnambulistic leave-taking and walking in her sleep , may remain a subject of contention ; but , on one point -LRB- and indeed the main one -RRB- all parties are agreed .
Parsing [sent. 9240 len. 15]: In whatever state she walked away , she certainly did not walk back again .
Parsing [sent. 9241 len. 27]: Mention having been made of the dusk of the afternoon , it will be inferred that Mr Brass 's task occupied some time in the completion .
Parsing [sent. 9242 len. 125]: It was not finished until evening ; but , being done at last , that worthy person and the three friends adjourned in a hackney-coach to the private office of a justice , who , giving Mr Brass a warm reception and detaining him in a secure place that he might insure to himself the pleasure of seeing him on the morrow , dismissed the others with the cheering assurance that a warrant could not fail to be granted next day for the apprehension of Mr Quilp , and that a proper application and statement of all the circumstances to the secretary of state -LRB- who was fortunately in town -RRB- , would no doubt procure Kit 's free pardon and liberation without delay .
Parsing [sent. 9243 len. 48]: And now , indeed , it seemed that Quilp 's malignant career was drawing to a close , and that retribution , which often travels slowly -- especially when heaviest -- had tracked his footsteps with a sure and certain scent and was gaining on him fast .
Parsing [sent. 9244 len. 15]: Unmindful of her stealthy tread , her victim holds his course in fancied triumph .
Parsing [sent. 9245 len. 16]: Still at his heels she comes , and once afoot , is never turned aside !
Parsing [sent. 9246 len. 45]: Their business ended , the three gentlemen hastened back to the lodgings of Mr Swiveller , whom they found progressing so favourably in his recovery as to have been able to sit up for half an hour , and to have conversed with cheerfulness .
Parsing [sent. 9247 len. 18]: Mrs Garland had gone home some time since , but Mr Abel was still sitting with him .
Parsing [sent. 9248 len. 43]: After telling him all they had done , the two Mr Garlands and the single gentleman , as if by some previous understanding , took their leaves for the night , leaving the invalid alone with the Notary and the small servant .
Parsing [sent. 9249 len. 39]: ` As you are so much better , ' said Mr Witherden , sitting down at the bedside , ' I may venture to communicate to you a piece of news which has come to me professionally . '
Parsing [sent. 9250 len. 24]: The idea of any professional intelligence from a gentleman connected with legal matters , appeared to afford Richard any-thing but a pleasing anticipation .
Parsing [sent. 9251 len. 27]: Perhaps he connected it in his own mind with one or two outstanding accounts , in reference to which he had already received divers threatening letters .
Parsing [sent. 9252 len. 12]: His countenance fell as he replied , ` Certainly , sir .
Parsing [sent. 9253 len. 15]: I hope it 's not anything of a very disagreeable nature , though ? '
Parsing [sent. 9254 len. 22]: ` if I thought it so , I should choose some better time for communicating it , ' replied the Notary .
Parsing [sent. 9255 len. 39]: ` Let me tell you , first , that my friends who have been here to-day , know nothing of it , and that their kindness to you has been quite spontaneous and with no hope of return .
Parsing [sent. 9256 len. 16]: It may do a thoughtless , careless man , good , to know that . '
Parsing [sent. 9257 len. 12]: Dick thanked him , and said he hoped it would . '
Parsing [sent. 9258 len. 33]: I have been making some inquiries about you , ' said Mr Witherden , ` little thinking that I should find you under such circumstances as those which have brought us together .
Parsing [sent. 9259 len. 18]: You are the nephew of Rebecca Swiveller , spinster , deceased , of Cheselbourne in Dorsetshire . '
Parsing [sent. 9260 len. 4]: ` Deceased ! '
Parsing [sent. 9261 len. 3]: cried Dick .
Parsing [sent. 9262 len. 3]: ` Deceased .
Parsing [sent. 9263 len. 35]: If you had been another sort of nephew , you would have come into possession -LRB- so says the will , and I see no reason to doubt it -RRB- of five-and-twenty thousand pounds .
Parsing [sent. 9264 len. 31]: As it is , you have fallen into an annuity of one hundred and fifty pounds a year ; but I think I may congratulate you even upon that . '
Parsing [sent. 9265 len. 16]: ` Sir , ' said Dick , sobbing and laughing together , ` you may .
Parsing [sent. 9266 len. 16]: For , please God , we 'll make a scholar of the poor Marchioness yet !
Parsing [sent. 9267 len. 25]: And she shall walk in silk attire , and siller have to spare , or may I never rise from this bed again ! '
Parsing [sent. 9268 len. 78]: Chapter 67 Unconscious of the proceedings faithfully narrated in the last chapter , and little dreaming of the mine which had been sprung beneath him -LRB- for , to the end that he should have no warning of the business a-foot , the profoundest secrecy was observed in the whole transaction -RRB- , Mr Quilp remained shut up in his hermitage , undisturbed by any suspicion , and extremely well satisfied with the result of his machinations .
Parsing [sent. 9269 len. 36]: Being engaged in the adjustment of some accounts -- an occupation to which the silence and solitude of his retreat were very favourable -- he had not strayed from his den for two whole days .
Parsing [sent. 9270 len. 23]: The third day of his devotion to this pursuit found him still hard at work , and little disposed to stir abroad .
Parsing [sent. 9271 len. 39]: It was the day next after Mr Brass 's confession , and consequently , that which threatened the restriction of Mr Quilp 's liberty , and the abrupt communication to him of some very unpleasant and unwelcome facts .
Parsing [sent. 9272 len. 68]: Having no intuitive perception of the cloud which lowered upon his house , the dwarf was in his ordinary state of cheerfulness ; and , when he found he was becoming too much engrossed by business with a due regard to his health and spirits , he varied its monotonous routine with a little screeching , or howling , or some other innocent relaxation of that nature .
Parsing [sent. 9273 len. 47]: He was attended , as usual , by Tom Scott , who sat crouching over the fire after the manner of a toad , and , from time to time , when his master 's back was turned , imitating his grimaces with a fearful exactness .
Parsing [sent. 9274 len. 14]: The figure-head had not yet disappeared , but remained in its old place .
Parsing [sent. 9275 len. 63]: The face , horribly seared by the frequent application of the red-hot poker , and further ornamented by the insertion , in the tip of the nose , of a tenpenny nail , yet smiled blandly in its less lacerated parts , and seemed , like a sturdy martyr , to provoke its tormentor to the commission of new outrages and insults .
Parsing [sent. 9276 len. 22]: The day , in the highest and brightest quarters of the town , was damp , dark , cold and gloomy .
Parsing [sent. 9277 len. 20]: In that low and marshy spot , the fog filled every nook and corner with a thick dense cloud .
Parsing [sent. 9278 len. 12]: Every object was obscure at one or two yards ' distance .
Parsing [sent. 9279 len. 61]: The warning lights and fires upon the river were powerless beneath this pall , and , but for a raw and piercing chillness in the air , and now and then the cry of some bewildered boatman as he rested on his oars and tried to make out where he was , the river itself might have been miles away .
Parsing [sent. 9280 len. 17]: The mist , though sluggish and slow to move , was of a keenly searching kind .
Parsing [sent. 9281 len. 11]: No muffling up in furs and broadcloth kept it out .
Parsing [sent. 9282 len. 22]: It seemed to penetrate into the very bones of the shrinking wayfarers , and to rack them with cold and pains .
Parsing [sent. 9283 len. 9]: Everything was wet and clammy to the touch .
Parsing [sent. 9284 len. 13]: The warm blaze alone defied it , and leaped and sparkled merrily .
Parsing [sent. 9285 len. 41]: It was a day to be at home , crowding about the fire , telling stories of travellers who had lost their way in such weather on heaths and moors ; and to love a warm hearth more than ever .
Parsing [sent. 9286 len. 31]: The dwarf 's humour , as we know , was to have a fireside to himself ; and when he was disposed to be convivial , to enjoy himself alone .
Parsing [sent. 9287 len. 38]: By no means insensible to the comfort of being within doors , he ordered Tom Scott to pile the little stove with coals , and , dismissing his work for that day , determined to be jovial .
Parsing [sent. 9288 len. 57]: To this end , he lighted up fresh candles and heaped more fuel on the fire ; and having dined off a beefsteak , which he cooked himself in somewhat of a savage and cannibal-like manner , brewed a great bowl of hot punch , lighted his pipe , and sat down to spend the evening .
Parsing [sent. 9289 len. 14]: At this moment , a low knocking at the cabin-door arrested his attention .
Parsing [sent. 9290 len. 27]: When it had been twice or thrice repeated , he softly opened the little window , and thrusting his head out , demanded who was there .
Parsing [sent. 9291 len. 13]: ` Only me , Quilp , ' replied a woman 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 9292 len. 5]: ` Only you ! '
Parsing [sent. 9293 len. 16]: cried the dwarf , stretching his neck to obtain a better view of his visitor .
Parsing [sent. 9294 len. 10]: ` And what brings you here , you jade ?
Parsing [sent. 9295 len. 13]: How dare you approach the ogre 's castle , eh ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9296 len. 12]: I have come with some news , ' rejoined his spouse .
Parsing [sent. 9297 len. 9]: ` Do n't be angry with me . '
Parsing [sent. 9298 len. 21]: ` Is it good news , pleasant news , news to make a man skip and snap his fingers ? '
Parsing [sent. 9299 len. 4]: said the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 9300 len. 10]: ` Is the dear old lady dead ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9301 len. 22]: I do n't know what news it is , or whether it 's good or bad , ' rejoined his wife .
Parsing [sent. 9302 len. 20]: ` Then she 's alive , ' said Quilp , ` and there 's nothing the matter with her .
Parsing [sent. 9303 len. 15]: Go home again , you bird of evil note , go home ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 9304 len. 13]: I have brought a letter , ' cried the meek little woman .
Parsing [sent. 9305 len. 32]: ` Toss it in at the window here , and go your ways , ' said Quilp , interrupting her , ` or I 'll come out and scratch you . '
Parsing [sent. 9306 len. 22]: ` No , but please , Quilp -- do hear me speak , ' urged his submissive wife , in tears .
Parsing [sent. 9307 len. 5]: ` Please do ! '
Parsing [sent. 9308 len. 13]: ` Speak then , ' growled the dwarf with a malicious grin .
Parsing [sent. 9309 len. 8]: ` Be quick and short about it .
Parsing [sent. 9310 len. 6]: Speak , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9311 len. 67]: ` It was left at our house this afternoon , ' said Mrs Quilp , trembling , ` by a boy who said he did n't know from whom it came , but that it was given to him to leave , and that he was told to say it must be brought on to you directly , for it was of the very greatest consequence .
Parsing [sent. 9312 len. 24]: -- But please , ' she added , as her husband stretched out his hand for it , ` please let me in .
Parsing [sent. 9313 len. 28]: You do n't know how wet and cold I am , or how many times I have lost my way in coming here through this thick fog .
Parsing [sent. 9314 len. 11]: Let me dry myself at the fire for five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 9315 len. 12]: I 'll go away directly you tell me to , Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 9316 len. 7]: Upon my word I will . '
Parsing [sent. 9317 len. 42]: Her amiable husband hesitated for a few moments ; but , bethinking himself that the letter might require some answer , of which she could be the bearer , closed the window , opened the door , and bade her enter .
Parsing [sent. 9318 len. 25]: Mrs Quilp obeyed right willingly , and , kneeling down before the fire to warm her hands , delivered into his a little packet .
Parsing [sent. 9319 len. 20]: ` I 'm glad you 're wet , ' said Quilp , snatching it , and squinting at her .
Parsing [sent. 9320 len. 8]: ` I 'm glad you 're cold .
Parsing [sent. 9321 len. 8]: I 'm glad you lost your way .
Parsing [sent. 9322 len. 10]: I 'm glad your eyes are red with crying .
Parsing [sent. 9323 len. 16]: It does my heart good to see your little nose so pinched and frosty . '
Parsing [sent. 9324 len. 5]: ` Oh Quilp ! '
Parsing [sent. 9325 len. 4]: sobbed his wife .
Parsing [sent. 9326 len. 9]: ` How cruel it is of you ! '
Parsing [sent. 9327 len. 9]: ` Did she think I was dead ? '
Parsing [sent. 9328 len. 14]: said Quilp , wrinkling his face into a most extraordinary series of grimaces .
Parsing [sent. 9329 len. 20]: ` Did she think she was going to have all the money , and to marry somebody she liked ?
Parsing [sent. 9330 len. 4]: Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 9331 len. 4]: Did she ? '
Parsing [sent. 9332 len. 31]: These taunts elicited no reply from the poor little woman , who remained on her knees , warming her hands , and sobbing , to Mr Quilp 's great delight .
Parsing [sent. 9333 len. 61]: But , just as he was contemplating her , and chuckling excessively , he happened to observe that Tom Scott was delighted too ; wherefore , that he might have no presumptuous partner in his glee , the dwarf instantly collared him , dragged him to the door , and after a short scuffle , kicked him into the yard .
Parsing [sent. 9334 len. 45]: In return for this mark of attention , Tom immediately walked upon his hands to the window , and -- if the expression be allowable -- looked in with his shoes : besides rattling his feet upon the glass like a Banshee upside down .
Parsing [sent. 9335 len. 55]: As a matter of course , Mr Quilp lost no time in resorting to the infallible poker , with which , after some dodging and lying in ambush , he paid his young friend one or two such unequivocal compliments that he vanished precipitately , and left him in quiet possession of the field .
Parsing [sent. 9336 len. 3]: ` So !
Parsing [sent. 9337 len. 21]: That little job being disposed of , ' said the dwarf , coolly , ` I 'll read my letter .
Parsing [sent. 9338 len. 3]: Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 9339 len. 9]: he muttered , looking at the direction . '
Parsing [sent. 9340 len. 7]: I ought to know this writing .
Parsing [sent. 9341 len. 4]: Beautiful Sally ! '
Parsing [sent. 9342 len. 30]: Opening it , he read , in a fair , round , legal hand , as follows : ` Sammy has been practised upon , and has broken confidence .
Parsing [sent. 9343 len. 6]: It has all come out .
Parsing [sent. 9344 len. 18]: You had better not be in the way , for strangers are going to call upon you .
Parsing [sent. 9345 len. 15]: They have been very quiet as yet , because they mean to surprise you .
Parsing [sent. 9346 len. 5]: Do n't lose time .
Parsing [sent. 9347 len. 4]: I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 9348 len. 8]: I am not to be found anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 9349 len. 10]: If I was you , I would n't either .
Parsing [sent. 9350 len. 50]: S. B. , late of B. M. ' To describe the changes that passed over Quilp 's face , as he read this letter half-a-dozen times , would require some new language : such , for power of expression , as was never written , read , or spoken .
Parsing [sent. 9351 len. 45]: For a long time he did not utter one word ; but , after a considerable interval , during which Mrs Quilp was almost paralysed with the alarm his looks engendered , he contrived to gasp out , ` If I had him here .
Parsing [sent. 9352 len. 13]: If I only had him here -- ' ` Oh Quilp ! '
Parsing [sent. 9353 len. 10]: said his wife , ` what 's the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 9354 len. 8]: Who are you angry with ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9355 len. 15]: -- I should drown him , ' said the dwarf , not heeding her .
Parsing [sent. 9356 len. 20]: ` Too easy a death , too short , too quick -- but the river runs close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 9357 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9358 len. 6]: if I had him here !
Parsing [sent. 9359 len. 36]: just to take him to the brink coaxingly and pleasantly , -- holding him by the button-hole -- joking with him , -- and , with a sudden push , to send him splashing down !
Parsing [sent. 9360 len. 11]: Drowning men come to the surface three times they say .
Parsing [sent. 9361 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 9362 len. 29]: To see him those three times , and mock him as his face came bobbing up , -- oh , what a rich treat that would be ! '
Parsing [sent. 9363 len. 4]: ` Quilp ! '
Parsing [sent. 9364 len. 23]: stammered his wife , venturing at the same time to touch him on the shoulder : ` what has gone wrong ? '
Parsing [sent. 9365 len. 23]: She was so terrified by the relish with which he pictured this pleasure to himself that she could scarcely make herself intelligible .
Parsing [sent. 9366 len. 7]: ` Such a bloodless cur ! '
Parsing [sent. 9367 len. 16]: said Quilp , rubbing his hands very slowly , and pressing them tight together . '
Parsing [sent. 9368 len. 15]: I thought his cowardice and servility were the best guarantee for his keeping silence .
Parsing [sent. 9369 len. 27]: Oh Brass , Brass -- my dear , good , affectionate , faithful , complimentary , charming friend -- if I only had you here ! '
Parsing [sent. 9370 len. 55]: His wife , who had retreated lest she should seem to listen to these mutterings , ventured to approach him again , and was about to speak , when he hurried to the door , and called Tom Scott , who , remembering his late gentle admonition , deemed it prudent to appear immediately .
Parsing [sent. 9371 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 9372 len. 8]: said the dwarf , pulling him in .
Parsing [sent. 9373 len. 5]: ` Take her home .
Parsing [sent. 9374 len. 14]: Do n't come here to-morrow , for this place will be shut up .
Parsing [sent. 9375 len. 13]: Come back no more till you hear from me or see me .
Parsing [sent. 9376 len. 5]: Do you mind ? '
Parsing [sent. 9377 len. 13]: Tom nodded sulkily , and beckoned Mrs Quilp to lead the way .
Parsing [sent. 9378 len. 33]: ` As for you , ' said the dwarf , addressing himself to her , ` ask no questions about me , make no search for me , say nothing concerning me .
Parsing [sent. 9379 len. 14]: I shall not be dead , mistress , and that 'll comfort you .
Parsing [sent. 9380 len. 8]: He 'll take care of you . '
Parsing [sent. 9381 len. 5]: ` But , Quilp ?
Parsing [sent. 9382 len. 5]: What is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 9383 len. 5]: Where are you going ?
Parsing [sent. 9384 len. 6]: Do say something more ? '
Parsing [sent. 9385 len. 39]: ` I 'll say that , ' said the dwarf , seizing her by the arm , ` and do that too , which undone and unsaid would be best for you , unless you go directly . '
Parsing [sent. 9386 len. 6]: ` Has anything happened ? '
Parsing [sent. 9387 len. 4]: cried his wife .
Parsing [sent. 9388 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9389 len. 6]: Do tell me that ? '
Parsing [sent. 9390 len. 8]: ` Yes , ' snarled the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 9391 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 9392 len. 4]: What matter which ?
Parsing [sent. 9393 len. 8]: I have told you what to do .
Parsing [sent. 9394 len. 19]: Woe betide you if you fail to do it , or disobey me by a hair 's breadth .
Parsing [sent. 9395 len. 6]: Will you go ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 9396 len. 23]: I am going , I 'll go directly ; but , ' faltered his wife , ` answer me one question first .
Parsing [sent. 9397 len. 10]: Has this letter any connexion with dear little Nell ?
Parsing [sent. 9398 len. 12]: I must ask you that -- I must indeed , Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 9399 len. 20]: You can not think what days and nights of sorrow I have had through having once deceived that child .
Parsing [sent. 9400 len. 26]: I do n't know what harm I may have brought about , but , great or little , I did it for you , Quilp .
Parsing [sent. 9401 len. 9]: My conscience misgave me when I did it .
Parsing [sent. 9402 len. 11]: Do answer me this question , if you please ? '
Parsing [sent. 9403 len. 39]: The exasperated dwarf returned no answer , but turned round and caught up his usual weapon with such vehemence , that Tom Scott dragged his charge away , by main force , and as swiftly as he could .
Parsing [sent. 9404 len. 48]: It was well he did so , for Quilp , who was nearly mad with rage , pursued them to the neighbouring lane , and might have prolonged the chase but for the dense mist which obscured them from his view and appeared to thicken every moment .
Parsing [sent. 9405 len. 28]: ` It will be a good night for travelling anonymously , ' he said , as he returned slowly , being pretty well breathed with his run .
Parsing [sent. 9406 len. 3]: ` Stay .
Parsing [sent. 9407 len. 6]: We may look better here .
Parsing [sent. 9408 len. 8]: This is too hospitable and free . '
Parsing [sent. 9409 len. 30]: By a great exertion of strength , he closed the two old gates , which were deeply sunken in the mud , and barred them with a heavy beam .
Parsing [sent. 9410 len. 17]: That done , he shook his matted hair from about his eyes , and tried them .
Parsing [sent. 9411 len. 5]: -- Strong and fast .
Parsing [sent. 9412 len. 25]: ` The fence between this wharf and the next is easily climbed , ' said the dwarf , when he had taken these precautions .
Parsing [sent. 9413 len. 12]: ` There 's a back lane , too , from there .
Parsing [sent. 9414 len. 7]: That shall be my way out .
Parsing [sent. 9415 len. 17]: A man need know his road well , to find it in this lovely place to-night .
Parsing [sent. 9416 len. 14]: I need fear no unwelcome visitors while this lasts , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 9417 len. 53]: Almost reduced to the necessity of groping his way with his hands -LRB- it had grown so dark and the fog had so much increased -RRB- , he returned to his lair ; and , after musing for some time over the fire , busied himself in preparations for a speedy departure .
Parsing [sent. 9418 len. 43]: While he was collecting a few necessaries and cramming them into his pockets , he never once ceased communing with himself in a low voice , or unclenched his teeth , which he had ground together on finishing Miss Brass 's note .
Parsing [sent. 9419 len. 5]: ` Oh Sampson ! '
Parsing [sent. 9420 len. 15]: he muttered , ` good worthy creature -- if I could but hug you !
Parsing [sent. 9421 len. 36]: If I could only fold you in my arms , and squeeze your ribs , as I COULD squeeze them if I once had you tight -- what a meeting there would be between us !
Parsing [sent. 9422 len. 25]: If we ever do cross each other again , Sampson , we 'll have a greeting not easily to be forgotten , trust me .
Parsing [sent. 9423 len. 20]: This time , Sampson , this moment when all had gone on so well , was so nicely chosen !
Parsing [sent. 9424 len. 13]: It was so thoughtful of you , so penitent , so good .
Parsing [sent. 9425 len. 29]: oh , if we were face to face in this room again , my white-livered man of law , how well contented one of us would be ! '
Parsing [sent. 9426 len. 33]: There he stopped ; and raising the bowl of punch to his lips , drank a long deep draught , as if it were fair water and cooling to his parched mouth .
Parsing [sent. 9427 len. 17]: Setting it down abruptly , and resuming his preparations , he went on with his soliloquy .
Parsing [sent. 9428 len. 30]: ` There 's Sally , ' he said , with flashing eyes ; ` the woman has spirit , determination , purpose -- was she asleep , or petrified ?
Parsing [sent. 9429 len. 10]: She could have stabbed him -- poisoned him safely .
Parsing [sent. 9430 len. 8]: She might have seen this coming on .
Parsing [sent. 9431 len. 12]: Why does she give me notice when it 's too late ?
Parsing [sent. 9432 len. 38]: When he sat there , -- yonder there , over there , -- with his white face , and red head , and sickly smile , why did n't I know what was passing in his heart ?
Parsing [sent. 9433 len. 37]: It should have stopped beating , that night , if I had been in his secret , or there are no drugs to lull a man to sleep , or no fire to burn him ! '
Parsing [sent. 9434 len. 23]: Another draught from the bowl ; and , cowering over the fire with a ferocious aspect , he muttered to himself again .
Parsing [sent. 9435 len. 32]: ` And this , like every other trouble and anxiety I have had of late times , springs from that old dotard and his darling child -- two wretched feeble wanderers !
Parsing [sent. 9436 len. 8]: I 'll be their evil genius yet .
Parsing [sent. 9437 len. 18]: And you , sweet Kit , honest Kit , virtuous , innocent Kit , look to yourself .
Parsing [sent. 9438 len. 7]: Where I hate , I bite .
Parsing [sent. 9439 len. 25]: I hate you , my darling fellow , with good cause , and proud as you are to-night , I 'll have my turn .
Parsing [sent. 9440 len. 6]: -- What 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 9441 len. 9]: A knocking at the gate he had closed .
Parsing [sent. 9442 len. 6]: A loud and violent knocking .
Parsing [sent. 9443 len. 15]: Then , a pause ; as if those who knocked had stopped to listen .
Parsing [sent. 9444 len. 13]: Then , the noise again , more clamorous and importunate than before .
Parsing [sent. 9445 len. 5]: ` So soon ! '
Parsing [sent. 9446 len. 4]: said the dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 9447 len. 5]: ` And so eager !
Parsing [sent. 9448 len. 8]: I am afraid I shall disappoint you .
Parsing [sent. 9449 len. 8]: It 's well I 'm quite prepared .
Parsing [sent. 9450 len. 7]: Sally , I thank you ! '
Parsing [sent. 9451 len. 9]: As he spoke , he extinguished the candle .
Parsing [sent. 9452 len. 46]: In his impetuous attempts to subdue the brightness of the fire , he overset the stove , which came tumbling forward , and fell with a crash upon the burning embers it had shot forth in its descent , leaving the room in pitchy darkness .
Parsing [sent. 9453 len. 23]: The noise at the gate still continuing , he felt his way to the door , and stepped into the open air .
Parsing [sent. 9454 len. 7]: At that moment the knocking ceased .
Parsing [sent. 9455 len. 37]: It was about eight o'clock ; but the dead of the darkest night would have been as noon-day in comparison with the thick cloud which then rested upon the earth , and shrouded everything from view .
Parsing [sent. 9456 len. 45]: He darted forward for a few paces , as if into the mouth of some dim , yawning cavern ; then , thinking he had gone wrong , changed the direction of his steps ; then stood still , not knowing where to turn .
Parsing [sent. 9457 len. 30]: ` If they would knock again , ' said Quilp , trying to peer into the gloom by which he was surrounded , ` the sound might guide me !
Parsing [sent. 9458 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 9459 len. 7]: Batter the gate once more ! '
Parsing [sent. 9460 len. 12]: He stood listening intently , but the noise was not renewed .
Parsing [sent. 9461 len. 21]: Nothing was to be heard in that deserted place , but , at intervals , the distant barkings of dogs .
Parsing [sent. 9462 len. 33]: The sound was far away -- now in one quarter , now answered in another -- nor was it any guide , for it often came from shipboard , as he knew .
Parsing [sent. 9463 len. 34]: ` If I could find a wall or fence , ' said the dwarf , stretching out his arms , and walking slowly on , ' I should know which way to turn .
Parsing [sent. 9464 len. 17]: A good , black , devil 's night this , to have my dear friend here !
Parsing [sent. 9465 len. 21]: If I had but that wish , it might , for anything I cared , never be day again . '
Parsing [sent. 9466 len. 23]: As the word passed his lips , he staggered and fell -- and next moment was fighting with the cold dark water !
Parsing [sent. 9467 len. 34]: For all its bubbling up and rushing in his ears , he could hear the knocking at the gate again -- could hear a shout that followed it -- could recognise the voice .
Parsing [sent. 9468 len. 69]: For all his struggling and plashing , he could understand that they had lost their way , and had wandered back to the point from which they started ; that they were all but looking on , while he was drowned ; that they were close at hand , but could not make an effort to save him ; that he himself had shut and barred them out .
Parsing [sent. 9469 len. 35]: He answered the shout -- with a yell , which seemed to make the hundred fires that danced before his eyes tremble and flicker , as if a gust of wind had stirred them .
Parsing [sent. 9470 len. 6]: It was of no avail .
Parsing [sent. 9471 len. 17]: The strong tide filled his throat , and bore him on , upon its rapid current .
Parsing [sent. 9472 len. 38]: Another mortal struggle , and he was up again , beating the water with his hands , and looking out , with wild and glaring eyes that showed him some black object he was drifting close upon .
Parsing [sent. 9473 len. 6]: The hull of a ship !
Parsing [sent. 9474 len. 12]: He could touch its smooth and slippery surface with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 9475 len. 32]: One loud cry , now -- but the resistless water bore him down before he could give it utterance , and , driving him under it , carried away a corpse .
Parsing [sent. 9476 len. 93]: It toyed and sported with its ghastly freight , now bruising it against the slimy piles , now hiding it in mud or long rank grass , now dragging it heavily over rough stones and gravel , now feigning to yield it to its own element , and in the same action luring it away , until , tired of the ugly plaything , it flung it on a swamp -- a dismal place where pirates had swung in chains through many a wintry night -- and left it there to bleach .
Parsing [sent. 9477 len. 6]: And there it lay alone .
Parsing [sent. 9478 len. 26]: The sky was red with flame , and the water that bore it there had been tinged with the sullen light as it flowed along .
Parsing [sent. 9479 len. 20]: The place the deserted carcass had left so recently , a living man , was now a blazing ruin .
Parsing [sent. 9480 len. 10]: There was something of the glare upon its face .
Parsing [sent. 9481 len. 47]: The hair , stirred by the damp breeze , played in a kind of mockery of death -- such a mockery as the dead man himself would have delighted in when alive -- about its head , and its dress fluttered idly in the night wind .
Parsing [sent. 9482 len. 37]: Chapter 68 Lighted rooms , bright fires , cheerful faces , the music of glad voices , words of love and welcome , warm hearts , and tears of happiness -- what a change is this !
Parsing [sent. 9483 len. 11]: But it is to such delights that Kit is hastening .
Parsing [sent. 9484 len. 8]: They are awaiting him , he knows .
Parsing [sent. 9485 len. 14]: He fears he will die of joy , before he gets among them .
Parsing [sent. 9486 len. 10]: They have prepared him for this , all day .
Parsing [sent. 9487 len. 17]: He is not to be carried off to-morrow with the rest , they tell him first .
Parsing [sent. 9488 len. 27]: By degrees they let him know that doubts have arisen , that inquiries are to be made , and perhaps he may be pardoned after all .
Parsing [sent. 9489 len. 20]: At last , the evening being come , they bring him to a room where some gentlemen are assembled .
Parsing [sent. 9490 len. 18]: Foremost among them is his good old master , who comes and takes him by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 9491 len. 14]: He hears that his innocence is established , and that he is pardoned .
Parsing [sent. 9492 len. 24]: He can not see the speaker , but he turns towards the voice , and in trying to answer , falls down insensible .
Parsing [sent. 9493 len. 20]: They recover him again , and tell him he must be composed , and bear this like a man .
Parsing [sent. 9494 len. 10]: Somebody says he must think of his poor mother .
Parsing [sent. 9495 len. 19]: It is because he does think of her so much , that the happy news had overpowered him .
Parsing [sent. 9496 len. 29]: They crowd about him , and tell him that the truth has gone abroad , and that all the town and country ring with sympathy for his misfortunes .
Parsing [sent. 9497 len. 7]: He has no ears for this .
Parsing [sent. 9498 len. 13]: His thoughts , as yet , have no wider range than home .
Parsing [sent. 9499 len. 5]: Does she know it ?
Parsing [sent. 9500 len. 5]: what did she say ?
Parsing [sent. 9501 len. 4]: who told her ?
Parsing [sent. 9502 len. 7]: He can speak of nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 9503 len. 31]: They make him drink a little wine , and talk kindly to him for a while , until he is more collected , and can listen , and thank them .
Parsing [sent. 9504 len. 6]: He is free to go .
Parsing [sent. 9505 len. 16]: Mr Garland thinks , if he feels better , it is time they went away .
Parsing [sent. 9506 len. 12]: The gentlemen cluster round him , and shake hands with him .
Parsing [sent. 9507 len. 50]: He feels very grateful to them for the interest they have in him , and for the kind promises they make ; but the power of speech is gone again , and he has much ado to keep his feet , even though leaning on his master 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 9508 len. 31]: As they come through the dismal passages , some officers of the jail who are in waiting there , congratulate him , in their rough way , on his release .
Parsing [sent. 9509 len. 24]: The newsmonger is of the number , but his manner is not quite hearty -- there is something of surliness in his compliments .
Parsing [sent. 9510 len. 31]: He looks upon Kit as an intruder , as one who has obtained admission to that place on false pretences , who has enjoyed a privilege without being duly qualified .
Parsing [sent. 9511 len. 31]: He may be a very good sort of young man , he thinks , but he has no business there , and the sooner he is gone , the better .
Parsing [sent. 9512 len. 7]: The last door shuts behind them .
Parsing [sent. 9513 len. 41]: They have passed the outer wall , and stand in the open air -- in the street he has so often pictured to himself when hemmed in by the gloomy stones , and which has been in all his dreams .
Parsing [sent. 9514 len. 12]: It seems wider and more busy than it used to be .
Parsing [sent. 9515 len. 15]: The night is bad , and yet how cheerful and gay in his eyes !
Parsing [sent. 9516 len. 18]: One of the gentlemen , in taking leave of him , pressed some money into his hand .
Parsing [sent. 9517 len. 29]: He has not counted it ; but when they have gone a few paces beyond the box for poor Prisoners , he hastily returns and drops it in .
Parsing [sent. 9518 len. 25]: Mr Garland has a coach waiting in a neighbouring street , and , taking Kit inside with him , bids the man drive home .
Parsing [sent. 9519 len. 26]: At first , they can only travel at a foot pace , and then with torches going on before , because of the heavy fog .
Parsing [sent. 9520 len. 36]: But , as they get farther from the river , and leave the closer portions of the town behind , they are able to dispense with this precaution and to proceed at a brisker rate .
Parsing [sent. 9521 len. 61]: On the road , hard galloping would be too slow for Kit ; but , when they are drawing near their journey 's end , he begs they may go more slowly , and , when the house appears in sight , that they may stop -- only for a minute or two , to give him time to breathe .
Parsing [sent. 9522 len. 30]: But there is no stopping then , for the old gentleman speaks stoutly to him , the horses mend their pace , and they are already at the garden-gate .
Parsing [sent. 9523 len. 9]: Next minute , they are at the door .
Parsing [sent. 9524 len. 14]: There is a noise of tongues , and tread of feet , inside .
Parsing [sent. 9525 len. 3]: It opens .
Parsing [sent. 9526 len. 13]: Kit rushes in , and finds his mother clinging round his neck .
Parsing [sent. 9527 len. 223]: And there , too , is the ever faithful Barbara 's mother , still holding the baby as if she had never put it down since that sad day when they little hoped to have such joy as this -- there she is , Heaven bless her , crying her eyes out , and sobbing as never woman sobbed before ; and there is little Barbara -- poor little Barbara , so much thinner and so much paler , and yet so very pretty -- trembling like a leaf and supporting herself against the wall ; and there is Mrs Garland , neater and nicer than ever , fainting away stone dead with nobody to help her ; and there is Mr Abel , violently blowing his nose , and wanting to embrace everybody ; and there is the single gentleman hovering round them all , and constant to nothing for an instant ; and there is that good , dear , thoughtful little Jacob , sitting all alone by himself on the bottom stair , with his hands on his knees like an old man , roaring fearfully without giving any trouble to anybody ; and each and all of them are for the time clean out of their wits , and do jointly and severally commit all manner of follies .
Parsing [sent. 9528 len. 99]: And even when the rest have in some measure come to themselves again , and can find words and smiles , Barbara -- that soft-hearted , gentle , foolish little Barbara -- is suddenly missed , and found to be in a swoon by herself in the back parlour , from which swoon she falls into hysterics , and from which hysterics into a swoon again , and is , indeed , so bad , that despite a mortal quantity of vinegar and cold water she is hardly a bit better at last than she was at first .
Parsing [sent. 9529 len. 39]: Then , Kit 's mother comes in and says , will he come and speak to her ; and Kit says ` Yes , ' and goes ; and he says in a kind voice ` Barbara ! '
Parsing [sent. 9530 len. 29]: and Barbara 's mother tells her that ` it 's only Kit ; ' and Barbara says -LRB- with her eyes closed all the time -RRB- ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9531 len. 7]: but is it him indeed ? '
Parsing [sent. 9532 len. 23]: and Barbara 's mother says ` To be sure it is , my dear ; there 's nothing the matter now . '
Parsing [sent. 9533 len. 68]: And in further assurance that he 's safe and sound , Kit speaks to her again ; and then Barbara goes off into another fit of laughter , and then into another fit of crying ; and then Barbara 's mother and Kit 's mother nod to each other and pretend to scold her -- but only to bring her to herself the faster , bless you !
Parsing [sent. 9534 len. 43]: -- and being experienced matrons , and acute at perceiving the first dawning symptoms of recovery , they comfort Kit with the assurance that ` she 'll do now , ' and so dismiss him to the place from whence he came .
Parsing [sent. 9535 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 9536 len. 89]: In that place -LRB- which is the next room -RRB- there are decanters of wine , and all that sort of thing , set out as grand as if Kit and his friends were first-rate company ; and there is little Jacob , walking , as the popular phrase is , into a home-made plum-cake , at a most surprising pace , and keeping his eye on the figs and oranges which are to follow , and making the best use of his time , you may believe .
Parsing [sent. 9537 len. 61]: Kit no sooner comes in , than that single gentleman -LRB- never was such a busy gentleman -RRB- charges all the glasses -- bumpers -- and drinks his health , and tells him he shall never want a friend while he lives ; and so does Mr Garland , and so does Mrs Garland , and so does Mr Abel .
Parsing [sent. 9538 len. 75]: But even this honour and distinction is not all , for the single gentleman forthwith pulls out of his pocket a massive silver watch -- going hard , and right to half a second -- and upon the back of this watch is engraved Kit 's name , with flourishes all over ; and in short it is Kit 's watch , bought expressly for him , and presented to him on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 9539 len. 41]: You may rest assured that Mr and Mrs Garland ca n't help hinting about their present , in store , and that Mr Abel tells outright that he has his ; and that Kit is the happiest of the happy .
Parsing [sent. 9540 len. 46]: There is one friend he has not seen yet , and as he can not be conveniently introduced into the family circle , by reason of his being an iron-shod quadruped , Kit takes the first opportunity of slipping away and hurrying to the stable .
Parsing [sent. 9541 len. 83]: The moment he lays his hand upon the latch , the pony neighs the loudest pony 's greeting ; before he has crossed the threshold , the pony is capering about his loose box -LRB- for he brooks not the indignity of a halter -RRB- , mad to give him welcome ; and when Kit goes up to caress and pat him , the pony rubs his nose against his coat , and fondles him more lovingly than ever pony fondled man .
Parsing [sent. 9542 len. 26]: It is the crowning circumstance of his earnest , heartfelt reception ; and Kit fairly puts his arm round Whisker 's neck and hugs him .
Parsing [sent. 9543 len. 9]: But how comes Barbara to trip in there ?
Parsing [sent. 9544 len. 7]: and how smart she is again !
Parsing [sent. 9545 len. 10]: she has been at her glass since she recovered .
Parsing [sent. 9546 len. 14]: How comes Barbara in the stable , of all places in the world ?
Parsing [sent. 9547 len. 50]: Why , since Kit has been away , the pony would take his food from nobody but her , and Barbara , you see , not dreaming that Christopher was there , and just looking in , to see that everything was right , has come upon him unawares .
Parsing [sent. 9548 len. 4]: Blushing little Barbara !
Parsing [sent. 9549 len. 25]: It may be that Kit has caressed the pony enough ; it may be that there are even better things to caress than ponies .
Parsing [sent. 9550 len. 15]: He leaves him for Barbara at any rate , and hopes she is better .
Parsing [sent. 9551 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 9552 len. 7]: Barbara is a great deal better .
Parsing [sent. 9553 len. 22]: She is afraid -- and here Barbara looks down and blushes more -- that he must have thought her very foolish .
Parsing [sent. 9554 len. 9]: ` Not at all , ' says Kit .
Parsing [sent. 9555 len. 11]: Barbara is glad of that , and coughs -- Hem !
Parsing [sent. 9556 len. 12]: -- just the slightest cough possible -- not more than that .
Parsing [sent. 9557 len. 8]: What a discreet pony when he chooses !
Parsing [sent. 9558 len. 12]: He is as quiet now as if he were of marble .
Parsing [sent. 9559 len. 13]: He has a very knowing look , but that he always has .
Parsing [sent. 9560 len. 16]: ` We have hardly had time to shake hands , Barbara , ' says Kit .
Parsing [sent. 9561 len. 5]: Barbara gives him hers .
Parsing [sent. 9562 len. 7]: Why , she is trembling now !
Parsing [sent. 9563 len. 5]: Foolish , fluttering Barbara !
Parsing [sent. 9564 len. 4]: Arm 's length ?
Parsing [sent. 9565 len. 9]: The length of an arm is not much .
Parsing [sent. 9566 len. 28]: Barbara 's was not a long arm , by any means , and besides , she did n't hold it out straight , but bent a little .
Parsing [sent. 9567 len. 25]: Kit was so near her when they shook hands , that he could see a small tiny tear , yet trembling on an eyelash .
Parsing [sent. 9568 len. 14]: It was natural that he should look at it , unknown to Barbara .
Parsing [sent. 9569 len. 16]: It was natural that Barbara should raise her eyes unconsciously , and find him out .
Parsing [sent. 9570 len. 20]: Was it natural that at that instant , without any previous impulse or design , Kit should kiss Barbara ?
Parsing [sent. 9571 len. 8]: He did it , whether or no .
Parsing [sent. 9572 len. 16]: Barbara said ` for shame , ' but let him do it too -- twice .
Parsing [sent. 9573 len. 68]: He might have done it thrice , but the pony kicked up his heels and shook his head , as if he were suddenly taken with convulsions of delight , and Barbara being frightened , ran away -- not straight to where her mother and Kit 's mother were , though , lest they should see how red her cheeks were , and should ask her why .
Parsing [sent. 9574 len. 4]: Sly little Barbara !
Parsing [sent. 9575 len. 90]: When the first transports of the whole party had subsided , and Kit and his mother , and Barbara and her mother , with little Jacob and the baby to boot , had had their suppers together -- which there was no hurrying over , for they were going to stop there all night -- Mr Garland called Kit to him , and taking him into a room where they could be alone , told him that he had something yet to say , which would surprise him greatly .
Parsing [sent. 9576 len. 40]: Kit looked so anxious and turned so pale on hearing this , that the old gentleman hastened to add , he would be agreeably surprised ; and asked him if he would be ready next morning for a journey .
Parsing [sent. 9577 len. 8]: ` For a journey , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 9578 len. 3]: cried Kit .
Parsing [sent. 9579 len. 13]: ` In company with me and my friend in the next room .
Parsing [sent. 9580 len. 7]: Can you guess its purpose ? '
Parsing [sent. 9581 len. 10]: Kit turned paler yet , and shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 9582 len. 4]: ` Oh yes .
Parsing [sent. 9583 len. 11]: I think you do already , ' said his master .
Parsing [sent. 9584 len. 4]: ` Try . '
Parsing [sent. 9585 len. 45]: Kit murmured something rather rambling and unintelligible , but he plainly pronounced the words ` Miss Nell , ' three or four times -- shaking his head while he did so , as if he would add that there was no hope of that .
Parsing [sent. 9586 len. 31]: But Mr Garland , instead of saying ` Try again , ' as Kit had made sure he would , told him very seriously , that he had guessed right .
Parsing [sent. 9587 len. 18]: ` The place of their retreat is indeed discovered , ' he said , ` at last .
Parsing [sent. 9588 len. 9]: And that is our journey 's end . '
Parsing [sent. 9589 len. 30]: Kit faltered out such questions as , where was it , and how had it been found , and how long since , and was she well and happy ?
Parsing [sent. 9590 len. 14]: ` Happy she is , beyond all doubt , ' said Mr Garland .
Parsing [sent. 9591 len. 13]: ` And well , I -- I trust she will be soon .
Parsing [sent. 9592 len. 28]: She has been weak and ailing , as I learn , but she was better when I heard this morning , and they were full of hope .
Parsing [sent. 9593 len. 12]: Sit you down , and you shall hear the rest . '
Parsing [sent. 9594 len. 14]: Scarcely venturing to draw his breath , Kit did as he was told .
Parsing [sent. 9595 len. 68]: Mr Garland then related to him , how he had a brother -LRB- of whom he would remember to have heard him speak , and whose picture , taken when he was a young man , hung in the best room -RRB- , and how this brother lived a long way off , in a country-place , with an old clergyman who had been his early friend .
Parsing [sent. 9596 len. 76]: How , although they loved each other as brothers should , they had not met for many years , but had communicated by letter from time to time , always looking forward to some period when they would take each other by the hand once more , and still letting the Present time steal on , as it was the habit for men to do , and suffering the Future to melt into the Past .
Parsing [sent. 9597 len. 55]: How this brother , whose temper was very mild and quiet and retiring -- such as Mr Abel 's -- was greatly beloved by the simple people among whom he dwelt , who quite revered the Bachelor -LRB- for so they called him -RRB- , and had every one experienced his charity and benevolence .
Parsing [sent. 9598 len. 59]: How even those slight circumstances had come to his knowledge , very slowly and in course of years , for the Bachelor was one of those whose goodness shuns the light , and who have more pleasure in discovering and extolling the good deeds of others , than in trumpeting their own , be they never so commendable .
Parsing [sent. 9599 len. 94]: How , for that reason , he seldom told them of his village friends ; but how , for all that , his mind had become so full of two among them -- a child and an old man , to whom he had been very kind -- that , in a letter received a few days before , he had dwelt upon them from first to last , and had told such a tale of their wandering , and mutual love , that few could read it without being moved to tears .
Parsing [sent. 9600 len. 42]: How he , the recipient of that letter , was directly led to the belief that these must be the very wanderers for whom so much search had been made , and whom Heaven had directed to his brother 's care .
Parsing [sent. 9601 len. 51]: How he had written for such further information as would put the fact beyond all doubt ; how it had that morning arrived ; had confirmed his first impression into a certainty ; and was the immediate cause of that journey being planned , which they were to take to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 9602 len. 43]: ` In the meantime , ' said the old gentleman rising , and laying his hand on Kit 's shoulder , ` you have a great need of rest ; for such a day as this would wear out the strongest man .
Parsing [sent. 9603 len. 15]: Good night , and Heaven send our journey may have a prosperous ending ! '
Parsing [sent. 9604 len. 28]: Chapter 69 Kit was no sluggard next morning , but , springing from his bed some time before day , began to prepare for his welcome expedition .
Parsing [sent. 9605 len. 46]: The hurry of spirits consequent upon the events of yesterday , and the unexpected intelligence he had heard at night , had troubled his sleep through the long dark hours , and summoned such uneasy dreams about his pillow that it was rest to rise .
Parsing [sent. 9606 len. 136]: But , had it been the beginning of some great labour with the same end in view -- had it been the commencement of a long journey , to be performed on foot in that inclement season of the year , to be pursued under very privation and difficulty , and to be achieved only with great distress , fatigue , and suffering -- had it been the dawn of some painful enterprise , certain to task his utmost powers of resolution and endurance , and to need his utmost fortitude , but only likely to end , if happily achieved , in good fortune and delight to Nell -- Kit 's cheerful zeal would have been as highly roused : Kit 's ardour and impatience would have been , at least , the same .
Parsing [sent. 9607 len. 8]: Nor was he alone excited and eager .
Parsing [sent. 9608 len. 18]: Before he had been up a quarter of an hour the whole house were astir and busy .
Parsing [sent. 9609 len. 10]: Everybody hurried to do something towards facilitating the preparations .
Parsing [sent. 9610 len. 25]: The single gentleman , it is true , could do nothing himself , but he overlooked everybody else and was more locomotive than anybody .
Parsing [sent. 9611 len. 22]: The work of packing and making ready went briskly on , and by daybreak every preparation for the journey was completed .
Parsing [sent. 9612 len. 50]: Then Kit began to wish they had not been quite so nimble ; for the travelling-carriage which had been hired for the occasion was not to arrive until nine o'clock , and there was nothing but breakfast to fill up the intervening blank of one hour and a half .
Parsing [sent. 9613 len. 6]: Yes there was , though .
Parsing [sent. 9614 len. 4]: There was Barbara .
Parsing [sent. 9615 len. 35]: Barbara was busy , to be sure , but so much the better -- Kit could help her , and that would pass away the time better than any means that could be devised .
Parsing [sent. 9616 len. 43]: Barbara had no objection to this arrangement , and Kit , tracking out the idea which had come upon him so suddenly overnight , began to think that surely Barbara was fond of him , and surely he was fond of Barbara .
Parsing [sent. 9617 len. 77]: Now , Barbara , if the truth must.be told -- as it must and ought to be -- Barbara seemed , of all the little household , to take least pleasure in the bustle of the occasion ; and when Kit , in the openness of his heart , told her how glad and overjoyed it made him , Barbara became more downcast still , and seemed to have even less pleasure in it than before !
Parsing [sent. 9618 len. 52]: ` You have not been home so long , Christopher , ' said Barbara -- and it is impossible to tell how carelessly she said it -- ` You have not been home so long , that you need to be glad to go away again , I should think . '
Parsing [sent. 9619 len. 11]: ` But for such a purpose , ' returned Kit .
Parsing [sent. 9620 len. 7]: ` To bring back Miss Nell !
Parsing [sent. 9621 len. 5]: To see her again !
Parsing [sent. 9622 len. 5]: Only think of that !
Parsing [sent. 9623 len. 20]: I am so pleased too , to think that you will see her , Barbara , at last . '
Parsing [sent. 9624 len. 50]: Barbara did not absolutely say that she felt no gratification on this point , but she expressed the sentiment so plainly by one little toss of her head , that Kit was quite disconcerted , and wondered , in his simplicity , why she was so cool about it .
Parsing [sent. 9625 len. 26]: ` You 'll say she has the sweetest and beautifullest face you ever saw , I know , ' said Kit , rubbing his hands .
Parsing [sent. 9626 len. 10]: ` I 'm sure you 'll say that . '
Parsing [sent. 9627 len. 6]: Barbara tossed her head again .
Parsing [sent. 9628 len. 9]: ` What 's the matter , Barbara ? '
Parsing [sent. 9629 len. 3]: said Kit .
Parsing [sent. 9630 len. 7]: ` Nothing , ' cried Barbara .
Parsing [sent. 9631 len. 25]: And Barbara pouted -- not sulkily , or in an ugly manner , but just enough to make her look more cherry-lipped than ever .
Parsing [sent. 9632 len. 28]: There is no school in which a pupil gets on so fast , as that in which Kit became a scholar when he gave Barbara the kiss .
Parsing [sent. 9633 len. 33]: He saw what Barbara meant now -- he had his lesson by heart all at once -- she was the book -- there it was before him , as plain as print .
Parsing [sent. 9634 len. 16]: ` Barbara , ' said Kit , ` you 're not cross with me ? '
Parsing [sent. 9635 len. 4]: Oh dear no !
Parsing [sent. 9636 len. 6]: Why should Barbara be cross ?
Parsing [sent. 9637 len. 9]: And what right had she to be cross ?
Parsing [sent. 9638 len. 12]: And what did it matter whether she was cross or not ?
Parsing [sent. 9639 len. 4]: Who minded her !
Parsing [sent. 9640 len. 10]: ` Why , I do , ' said Kit .
Parsing [sent. 9641 len. 7]: ` Of course I do . '
Parsing [sent. 9642 len. 13]: Barbara did n't see why it was of course , at all .
Parsing [sent. 9643 len. 6]: Kit was sure she must .
Parsing [sent. 9644 len. 5]: Would she think again ?
Parsing [sent. 9645 len. 7]: Certainly , Barbara would think again .
Parsing [sent. 9646 len. 12]: No , she did n't see why it was of course .
Parsing [sent. 9647 len. 8]: She did n't understand what Christopher meant .
Parsing [sent. 9648 len. 41]: And besides she was sure they wanted her up stairs by this time , and she must go , indeed -- ` No , but Barbara , ' said Kit , detaining her gently , ` let us part friends .
Parsing [sent. 9649 len. 11]: I was always thinking of you , in my troubles .
Parsing [sent. 9650 len. 22]: I should have been a great deal more miserable than I was , if it had n't been for you . '
Parsing [sent. 9651 len. 23]: Goodness gracious , how pretty Barbara was when she coloured -- and when she trembled , like a little shrinking bird ! '
Parsing [sent. 9652 len. 27]: I am telling you the truth , Barbara , upon my word , but not half so strong as I could wish , ' said Kit .
Parsing [sent. 9653 len. 32]: ` When I want you to be pleased to see Miss Nell , it 's only because I like you to be pleased with what pleases me -- that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 9654 len. 32]: As to her , Barbara , I think I could almost die to do her service , but you would think so too , if you knew her as I do .
Parsing [sent. 9655 len. 7]: I am sure you would . '
Parsing [sent. 9656 len. 12]: Barbara was touched , and sorry to have appeared indifferent . '
Parsing [sent. 9657 len. 28]: I have been used , you see , ' said Kit , ` to talk and think of her , almost as if she was an angel .
Parsing [sent. 9658 len. 58]: When I look forward to meeting her again , I think of her smiling as she used to do , and being glad to see me , and putting out her hand and saying , `` It 's my own old Kit , '' or some such words as those -- like what she used to say .
Parsing [sent. 9659 len. 27]: I think of seeing her happy , and with friends about her , and brought up as she deserves , and as she ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 9660 len. 49]: When I think of myself , it 's as her old servant , and one that loved her dearly , as his kind , good , gentle mistress ; and who would have gone -- yes , and still would go -- through any harm to serve her .
Parsing [sent. 9661 len. 54]: Once , I could n't help being afraid that if she came back with friends about her she might forget , or be ashamed of having known , a humble lad like me , and so might speak coldly , which would have cut me , Barbara , deeper than I can tell .
Parsing [sent. 9662 len. 46]: But when I came to think again , I felt sure that I was doing her wrong in this ; and so I went on , as I did at first , hoping to see her once more , just as she used to be .
Parsing [sent. 9663 len. 41]: Hoping this , and remembering what she was , has made me feel as if I would always try to please her , and always be what I should like to seem to her if I was still her servant .
Parsing [sent. 9664 len. 34]: If I 'm the better for that -- and I do n't think I 'm the worse -- I am grateful to her for it , and love and honour her the more .
Parsing [sent. 9665 len. 17]: That 's the plain honest truth , dear Barbara , upon my word it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 9666 len. 22]: Little Barbara was not of a wayward or capricious nature , and , being full of remorse , melted into tears .
Parsing [sent. 9667 len. 66]: To what more conversation this might have led , we need not stop to inquire ; for the wheels of the carriage were heard at that moment , and , being followed by a smart ring at the garden gate , caused the bustle in the house , which had laid dormant for a short time , to burst again into tenfold life and vigour .
Parsing [sent. 9668 len. 33]: Simultaneously with the travelling equipage , arrived Mr Chuckster in a hackney cab , with certain papers and supplies of money for the single gentleman , into whose hands he delivered them .
Parsing [sent. 9669 len. 37]: This duty discharged , he subsided into the bosom of the family ; and , entertaining himself with a strolling or peripatetic breakfast , watched , with genteel indifference , the process of loading the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 9670 len. 12]: ` Snobby 's in this , I see , Sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 9671 len. 8]: he said to Mr Abel Garland . '
Parsing [sent. 9672 len. 26]: I thought he was n't in the last trip because it was expected that his presence would n't be acceptable to the ancient buffalo . '
Parsing [sent. 9673 len. 7]: ` To whom , Sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 9674 len. 4]: demanded Mr Abel .
Parsing [sent. 9675 len. 14]: ` To the old gentleman , ' returned Mr Chuckster , slightly abashed .
Parsing [sent. 9676 len. 16]: ` Our client prefers to take him now , ' said Mr Abel , drily .
Parsing [sent. 9677 len. 44]: ` There is no longer any need for that precaution , as my father 's relationship to a gentleman in whom the objects of his search have full confidence , will be a sufficient guarantee for the friendly nature of their errand . '
Parsing [sent. 9678 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 9679 len. 14]: thought Mr Chuckster , looking out of window , ` anybody but me !
Parsing [sent. 9680 len. 7]: Snobby before me , of course .
Parsing [sent. 9681 len. 29]: He did n't happen to take that particular five-pound note , but I have not the smallest doubt that he 's always up to something of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 9682 len. 11]: I always said it , long before this came out .
Parsing [sent. 9683 len. 5]: Devilish pretty girl that !
Parsing [sent. 9684 len. 11]: ` Pon my soul , an amazing little creature ! '
Parsing [sent. 9685 len. 61]: Barbara was the subject of Mr Chuckster 's commendations ; and as she was lingering near the carriage -LRB- all being now ready for its departure -RRB- , that gentleman was suddenly seized with a strong interest in the proceedings , which impelled him to swagger down the garden , and take up his position at a convenient ogling distance .
Parsing [sent. 9686 len. 50]: Having had great experience of the sex , and being perfectly acquainted with all those little artifices which find the readiest road to their hearts , Mr Chuckster , on taking his ground , planted one hand on his hip , and with the other adjusted his flowing hair .
Parsing [sent. 9687 len. 26]: This is a favourite attitude in the polite circles , and , accompanied with a graceful whistling , has been known to do immense execution .
Parsing [sent. 9688 len. 52]: Such , however , is the difference between town and country , that nobody took the smallest notice of this insinuating figure ; the wretches being wholly engaged in bidding the travellers farewell , in kissing hands to each other , waving handkerchiefs , and the like tame and vulgar practices .
Parsing [sent. 9689 len. 94]: For now the single gentleman and Mr Garland were in the carriage , and the post-boy was in the saddle , and Kit , well wrapped and muffled up , was in the rumble behind ; and Mrs Garland was there , and Mr Abel was there , and Kit 's mother was there , and little Jacob was there , and Barbara 's mother was visible in remote perspective , nursing the ever-wakeful baby ; and all were nodding , beckoning , curtseying , or crying out , ` Good bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 9690 len. 8]: with all the energy they could express .
Parsing [sent. 9691 len. 86]: In another minute , the carriage was out of sight ; and Mr Chuckster remained alone on the spot where it had lately been , with a vision of Kit standing up in the rumble waving his hand to Barbara , and of Barbara in the full light and lustre of his eyes -- his eyes -- Chuckster 's -- Chuckster the successful -- on whom ladies of quality had looked with favour from phaetons in the parks on Sundays -- waving hers to Kit !
Parsing [sent. 9692 len. 84]: How Mr Chuckster , entranced by this monstrous fact , stood for some time rooted to the earth , protesting within himself that Kit was the Prince of felonious characters , and very Emperor or Great Mogul of Snobs , and how he clearly traced this revolting circumstance back to that old villany of the shilling , are matters foreign to our purpose ; which is to track the rolling wheels , and bear the travellers company on their cold , bleak journey .
Parsing [sent. 9693 len. 6]: It was a bitter day .
Parsing [sent. 9694 len. 34]: A keen wind was blowing , and rushed against them fiercely : bleaching the hard ground , shaking the white frost from the trees and hedges , and whirling it away like dust .
Parsing [sent. 9695 len. 7]: But little cared Kit for weather .
Parsing [sent. 9696 len. 28]: There was a freedom and freshness in the wind , as it came howling by , which , let it cut never so sharp , was welcome .
Parsing [sent. 9697 len. 48]: As it swept on with its cloud of frost , bearing down the dry twigs and boughs and withered leaves , and carrying them away pell-mell , it seemed as though some general sympathy had got abroad , and everything was in a hurry , like themselves .
Parsing [sent. 9698 len. 13]: The harder the gusts , the better progress they appeared to make .
Parsing [sent. 9699 len. 72]: It was a good thing to go struggling and fighting forward , vanquishing them one by one ; to watch them driving up , gathering strength and fury as they came along ; to bend for a moment , as they whistled past ; and then to look back and see them speed away , their hoarse noise dying in the distance , and the stout trees cowering down before them .
Parsing [sent. 9700 len. 9]: All day long , it blew without cessation .
Parsing [sent. 9701 len. 20]: The night was clear and starlight , but the wind had not fallen , and the cold was piercing .
Parsing [sent. 9702 len. 152]: Sometimes -- towards the end of a long stage -- Kit could not help wishing it were a little warmer : but when they stopped to change horses , and he had had a good run , and what with that , and the bustle of paying the old postilion , and rousing the new one , and running to and fro again until the horses were put to , he was so warm that the blood tingled and smarted in his fingers ' ends -- then , he felt as if to have it one degree less cold would be to lose half the delight and glory of the journey : and up he jumped again , right cheerily , singing to the merry music of the wheels as they rolled away , and , leaving the townspeople in their warm beds , pursued their course along the lonely road .
Parsing [sent. 9703 len. 19]: Meantime the two gentlemen inside , who were little disposed to sleep , beguiled the time with conversation .
Parsing [sent. 9704 len. 39]: As both were anxious and expectant , it naturally turned upon the subject of their expedition , on the manner in which it had been brought about , and on the hopes and fears they entertained respecting it .
Parsing [sent. 9705 len. 30]: Of the former they had many , of the latter few -- none perhaps beyond that indefinable uneasiness which is inseparable from suddenly awakened hope , and protracted expectation .
Parsing [sent. 9706 len. 49]: In one of the pauses of their discourse , and when half the night had worn away , the single gentleman , who had gradually become more and more silent and thoughtful , turned to his companion and said abruptly : ` Are you a good listener ? '
Parsing [sent. 9707 len. 17]: ` Like most other men , I suppose , ' returned Mr Garland , smiling . '
Parsing [sent. 9708 len. 22]: I can be , if I am interested ; and if not interested , I should still try to appear so .
Parsing [sent. 9709 len. 7]: Why do you ask ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9710 len. 22]: I have a short narrative on my lips , ' rejoined his friend , ` and will try you with it .
Parsing [sent. 9711 len. 6]: It is very brief . '
Parsing [sent. 9712 len. 33]: Pausing for no reply , he laid his hand on the old gentleman 's sleeve , and proceeded thus : ` There were once two brothers , who loved each other dearly .
Parsing [sent. 9713 len. 12]: There was a disparity in their ages -- some twelve years .
Parsing [sent. 9714 len. 18]: I am not sure but they may insensibly have loved each other the better for that reason .
Parsing [sent. 9715 len. 16]: Wide as the interval between them was , however , they became rivals too soon .
Parsing [sent. 9716 len. 14]: The deepest and strongest affection of both their hearts settled upon one object .
Parsing [sent. 9717 len. 22]: ` The youngest -- there were reasons for his being sensitive and watchful -- was the first to find this out .
Parsing [sent. 9718 len. 24]: I will not tell you what misery he underwent , what agony of soul he knew , how great his mental struggle was .
Parsing [sent. 9719 len. 7]: He had been a sickly child .
Parsing [sent. 9720 len. 100]: His brother , patient and considerate in the midst of his own high health and strength , had many and many a day denied himself the sports he loved , to sit beside his couch , telling him old stories till his pale face lighted up with an unwonted glow ; to carry him in his arms to some green spot , where he could tend the poor pensive boy as he looked upon the bright summer day , and saw all nature healthy but himself ; to be , in any way , his fond and faithful nurse .
Parsing [sent. 9721 len. 27]: I may not dwell on all he did , to make the poor , weak creature love him , or my tale would have no end .
Parsing [sent. 9722 len. 20]: But when the time of trial came , the younger brother 's heart was full of those old days .
Parsing [sent. 9723 len. 16]: Heaven strengthened it to repay the sacrifices of inconsiderate youth by one of thoughtful manhood .
Parsing [sent. 9724 len. 8]: He left his brother to be happy .
Parsing [sent. 9725 len. 18]: The truth never passed his lips , and he quitted the country , hoping to die abroad .
Parsing [sent. 9726 len. 7]: ` The elder brother married her .
Parsing [sent. 9727 len. 15]: She was in Heaven before long , and left him with an infant daughter .
Parsing [sent. 9728 len. 88]: ` If you have seen the picture-gallery of any one old family , you will remember how the same face and figure -- often the fairest and slightest of them all -- come upon you in different generations ; and how you trace the same sweet girl through a long line of portraits -- never growing old or changing -- the Good Angel of the race -- abiding by them in all reverses -- redeeming all their sins -- ` In this daughter the mother lived again .
Parsing [sent. 9729 len. 25]: You may judge with what devotion he who lost that mother almost in the winning , clung to this girl , her breathing image .
Parsing [sent. 9730 len. 18]: She grew to womanhood , and gave her heart to one who could not know its worth .
Parsing [sent. 9731 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 9732 len. 11]: Her fond father could not see her pine and droop .
Parsing [sent. 9733 len. 10]: He might be more deserving than he thought him .
Parsing [sent. 9734 len. 12]: He surely might become so , with a wife like her .
Parsing [sent. 9735 len. 10]: He joined their hands , and they were married .
Parsing [sent. 9736 len. 72]: ` Through all the misery that followed this union ; through all the cold neglect and undeserved reproach ; through all the poverty he brought upon her ; through all the struggles of their daily life , too mean and pitiful to tell , but dreadful to endure ; she toiled on , in the deep devotion of her spirit , and in her better nature , as only women can .
Parsing [sent. 9737 len. 47]: Her means and substance wasted ; her father nearly beggared by her husband 's hand , and the hourly witness -LRB- for they lived now under one roof -RRB- of her ill-usage and unhappiness , -- she never , but for him , bewailed her fate .
Parsing [sent. 9738 len. 76]: Patient , and upheld by strong affection to the last , she died a widow of some three weeks ' date , leaving to her father 's care two orphans ; one a son of ten or twelve years old ; the other a girl -- such another infant child -- the same in helplessness , in age , in form , in feature -- as she had been herself when her young mother died .
Parsing [sent. 9739 len. 36]: ` The elder brother , grandfather to these two children , was now a broken man ; crushed and borne down , less by the weight of years than by the heavy hand of sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 9740 len. 23]: With the wreck of his possessions , he began to trade -- in pictures first , and then in curious ancient things .
Parsing [sent. 9741 len. 29]: He had entertained a fondness for such matters from a boy , and the tastes he had cultivated were now to yield him an anxious and precarious subsistence .
Parsing [sent. 9742 len. 57]: ` The boy grew like his father in mind and person ; the girl so like her mother , that when the old man had her on his knee , and looked into her mild blue eyes , he felt as if awakening from a wretched dream , and his daughter were a little child again .
Parsing [sent. 9743 len. 20]: The wayward boy soon spurned the shelter of his roof , and sought associates more congenial to his taste .
Parsing [sent. 9744 len. 10]: The old man and the child dwelt alone together .
Parsing [sent. 9745 len. 130]: ` It was then , when the love of two dead people who had been nearest and dearest to his heart , was all transferred to this slight creature ; when her face , constantly before him , reminded him , from hour to hour , of the too early change he had seen in such another -- of all the sufferings he had watched and known , and all his child had undergone ; when the young man 's profligate and hardened course drained him of money as his father 's had , and even sometimes occasioned them temporary privation and distress ; it was then that there began to beset him , and to be ever in his mind , a gloomy dread of poverty and want .
Parsing [sent. 9746 len. 9]: He had no thought for himself in this .
Parsing [sent. 9747 len. 7]: His fear was for the child .
Parsing [sent. 9748 len. 15]: It was a spectre in his house , and haunted him night and day .
Parsing [sent. 9749 len. 21]: ` The younger brother had been a traveller in many countries , and had made his pilgrimage through life alone .
Parsing [sent. 9750 len. 37]: His voluntary banishment had been misconstrued , and he had borne -LRB- not without pain -RRB- reproach and slight for doing that which had wrung his heart , and cast a mournful shadow on his path .
Parsing [sent. 9751 len. 53]: Apart from this , communication between him and the elder was difficult , and uncertain , and often failed ; still , it was not so wholly broken off but that he learnt -- with long blanks and gaps between each interval of information -- all that I have told you now .
Parsing [sent. 9752 len. 46]: ` Then , dreams of their young , happy life -- happy to him though laden with pain and early care -- visited his pillow yet oftener than before ; and every night , a boy again , he was at his brother 's side .
Parsing [sent. 9753 len. 68]: With the utmost speed he could exert , he settled his affairs ; converted into money all the goods he had ; and , with honourable wealth enough for both , with open heart and hand , with limbs that trembled as they bore him on , with emotion such as men can hardly bear and live , arrived one evening at his brother 's door ! '
Parsing [sent. 9754 len. 11]: The narrator , whose voice had faltered lately , stopped .
Parsing [sent. 9755 len. 21]: ` The rest , ' said Mr Garland , pressing his hand after a pause , ' I know . '
Parsing [sent. 9756 len. 16]: ` Yes , ' rejoined his friend , ` we may spare ourselves the sequel .
Parsing [sent. 9757 len. 10]: You know the poor result of all my search .
Parsing [sent. 9758 len. 57]: Even when by dint of such inquiries as the utmost vigilance and sagacity could set on foot , we found they had been seen with two poor travelling showmen -- and in time discovered the men themselves -- and in time , the actual place of their retreat ; even then , we were too late .
Parsing [sent. 9759 len. 11]: Pray God , we are not too late again ! '
Parsing [sent. 9760 len. 11]: ` We can not be , ' said Mr Garland .
Parsing [sent. 9761 len. 9]: ` This time we must succeed . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9762 len. 13]: I have believed and hoped so , ' returned the other . '
Parsing [sent. 9763 len. 9]: I try to believe and hope so still .
Parsing [sent. 9764 len. 31]: But a heavy weight has fallen on my spirits , my good friend , and the sadness that gathers over me , will yield to neither hope nor reason . '
Parsing [sent. 9765 len. 43]: ` That does not surprise me , ' said Mr Garland ; ` it is a natural consequence of the events you have recalled ; of this dreary time and place ; and above all , of this wild and dismal night .
Parsing [sent. 9766 len. 6]: A dismal night , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 9767 len. 2]: Hark !
Parsing [sent. 9768 len. 7]: how the wind is howling ! '
Parsing [sent. 9769 len. 13]: Chapter 70 Day broke , and found them still upon their way .
Parsing [sent. 9770 len. 32]: Since leaving home , they had halted here and there for necessary refreshment , and had frequently been delayed , especially in the night time , by waiting for fresh horses .
Parsing [sent. 9771 len. 22]: They had made no other stoppages , but the weather continued rough , and the roads were often steep and heavy .
Parsing [sent. 9772 len. 13]: It would be night again before they reached their place of destination .
Parsing [sent. 9773 len. 58]: Kit , all bluff and hardened with the cold , went on manfully ; and , having enough to do to keep his blood circulating , to picture to himself the happy end of this adventurous journey , and to look about him and be amazed at everything , had little spare time for thinking of discomforts .
Parsing [sent. 9774 len. 24]: Though his impatience , and that of his fellow-travellers , rapidly increased as the day waned , the hours did not stand still .
Parsing [sent. 9775 len. 23]: The short daylight of winter soon faded away , and it was dark again when they had yet many miles to travel .
Parsing [sent. 9776 len. 60]: As it grew dusk , the wind fell ; its distant moanings were more low and mournful ; and , as it came creeping up the road , and rattling covertly among the dry brambles on either hand , it seemed like some great phantom for whom the way was narrow , whose garments rustled as it stalked along .
Parsing [sent. 9777 len. 16]: By degrees it lulled and died away , and then it came on to snow .
Parsing [sent. 9778 len. 22]: The flakes fell fast and thick , soon covering the ground some inches deep , and spreading abroad a solemn stillness .
Parsing [sent. 9779 len. 25]: The rolling wheels were noiseless , and the sharp ring and clatter of the horses ' hoofs , became a dull , muffled tramp .
Parsing [sent. 9780 len. 19]: The life of their progress seemed to be slowly hushed , and something death-like to usurp its place .
Parsing [sent. 9781 len. 39]: Shading his eyes from the falling snow , which froze upon their lashes and obscured his sight , Kit often tried to catch the earliest glimpse of twinkling lights , denoting their approach to some not distant town .
Parsing [sent. 9782 len. 13]: He could descry objects enough at such times , but none correctly .
Parsing [sent. 9783 len. 34]: Now , a tall church spire appeared in view , which presently became a tree , a barn , a shadow on the ground , thrown on it by their own bright lamps .
Parsing [sent. 9784 len. 35]: Now , there were horsemen , foot-passengers , carriages , going on before , or meeting them in narrow ways ; which , when they were close upon them , turned to shadows too .
Parsing [sent. 9785 len. 34]: A wall , a ruin , a sturdy gable end , would rise up in the road ; and , when they were plunging headlong at it , would be the road itself .
Parsing [sent. 9786 len. 54]: Strange turnings too , bridges , and sheets of water , appeared to start up here and there , making the way doubtful and uncertain ; and yet they were on the same bare road , and these things , like the others , as they were passed , turned into dim illusions .
Parsing [sent. 9787 len. 36]: He descended slowly from his seat -- for his limbs were numbed -- when they arrived at a lone posting-house , and inquired how far they had to go to reach their journey 's end .
Parsing [sent. 9788 len. 27]: It was a late hour in such by-places , and the people were abed ; but a voice answered from an upper window , Ten miles .
Parsing [sent. 9789 len. 38]: The ten minutes that ensued appeared an hour ; but at the end of that time , a shivering figure led out the horses they required , and after another brief delay they were again in motion .
Parsing [sent. 9790 len. 46]: It was a cross-country road , full , after the first three or four miles , of holes and cart-ruts , which , being covered by the snow , were so many pitfalls to the trembling horses , and obliged them to keep a footpace .
Parsing [sent. 9791 len. 37]: As it was next to impossible for men so much agitated as they were by this time , to sit still and move so slowly , all three got out and plodded on behind the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 9792 len. 12]: The distance seemed interminable , and the walk was most laborious .
Parsing [sent. 9793 len. 34]: As each was thinking within himself that the driver must have lost his way , a church bell , close at hand , struck the hour of midnight , and the carriage stopped .
Parsing [sent. 9794 len. 32]: It had moved softly enough , but when it ceased to crunch the snow , the silence was as startling as if some great noise had been replaced by perfect stillness .
Parsing [sent. 9795 len. 28]: ` This is the place , gentlemen , ' said the driver , dismounting from his horse , and knocking at the door of a little inn .
Parsing [sent. 9796 len. 3]: ` Halloa !
Parsing [sent. 9797 len. 11]: Past twelve o'clock is the dead of night here . '
Parsing [sent. 9798 len. 16]: The knocking was loud and long , but it failed to rouse the drowsy inmates .
Parsing [sent. 9799 len. 8]: All continued dark and silent as before .
Parsing [sent. 9800 len. 24]: They fell back a little , and looked up at the windows , which were mere black patches in the whitened house front .
Parsing [sent. 9801 len. 4]: No light appeared .
Parsing [sent. 9802 len. 22]: The house might have been deserted , or the sleepers dead , for any air of life it had about it .
Parsing [sent. 9803 len. 24]: They spoke together with a strange inconsistency , in whispers ; unwilling to disturb again the dreary echoes they had just now raised .
Parsing [sent. 9804 len. 26]: ` Let us go on , ' said the younger brother , ` and leave this good fellow to wake them , if he can .
Parsing [sent. 9805 len. 14]: I can not rest until I know that we are not too late .
Parsing [sent. 9806 len. 12]: Let us go on , in the name of Heaven ! '
Parsing [sent. 9807 len. 22]: They did so , leaving the postilion to order such accommodation as the house afforded , and to renew his knocking .
Parsing [sent. 9808 len. 40]: Kit accompanied them with a little bundle , which he had hung in the carriage when they left home , and had not forgotten since -- the bird in his old cage -- just as she had left him .
Parsing [sent. 9809 len. 12]: She would be glad to see her bird , he knew .
Parsing [sent. 9810 len. 6]: The road wound gently downward .
Parsing [sent. 9811 len. 25]: As they proceeded , they lost sight of the church whose clock they had heard , and of the small village clustering round it .
Parsing [sent. 9812 len. 21]: The knocking , which was now renewed , and which in that stillness they could plainly hear , troubled them .
Parsing [sent. 9813 len. 22]: They wished the man would forbear , or that they had told him not to break the silence until they returned .
Parsing [sent. 9814 len. 31]: The old church tower , clad in a ghostly garb of pure cold white , again rose up before them , and a few moments brought them close beside it .
Parsing [sent. 9815 len. 15]: A venerable building -- grey , even in the midst of the hoary landscape .
Parsing [sent. 9816 len. 24]: An ancient sun-dial on the belfry wall was nearly hidden by the snow-drift , and scarcely to be known for what it was .
Parsing [sent. 9817 len. 22]: Time itself seemed to have grown dull and old , as if no day were ever to displace the melancholy night .
Parsing [sent. 9818 len. 37]: A wicket gate was close at hand , but there was more than one path across the churchyard to which it led , and , uncertain which to take , they came to a stand again .
Parsing [sent. 9819 len. 63]: The village street -- if street that could be called which was an irregular cluster of poor cottages of many heights and ages , some with their fronts , some with their backs , and some with gable ends towards the road , with here and there a signpost , or a shed encroaching on the path -- was close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 9820 len. 24]: There was a faint light in a chamber window not far off , and Kit ran towards that house to ask their way .
Parsing [sent. 9821 len. 45]: His first shout was answered by an old man within , who presently appeared at the casement , wrapping some garment round his throat as a protection from the cold , and demanded who was abroad at that unseasonable hour , wanting him . ''
Parsing [sent. 9822 len. 20]: Tis hard weather this , ' he grumbled , ` and not a night to call me up in .
Parsing [sent. 9823 len. 15]: My trade is not of that kind that I need be roused from bed .
Parsing [sent. 9824 len. 17]: The business on which folks want me , will keep cold , especially at this season .
Parsing [sent. 9825 len. 7]: What do you want ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9826 len. 21]: I would not have roused you , if I had known you were old and ill , ' said Kit .
Parsing [sent. 9827 len. 4]: ` Old ! '
Parsing [sent. 9828 len. 5]: repeated the other peevishly .
Parsing [sent. 9829 len. 9]: ` How do you know I am old ?
Parsing [sent. 9830 len. 11]: Not so old as you think , friend , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 9831 len. 18]: As to being ill , you will find many young people in worse case than I am .
Parsing [sent. 9832 len. 34]: More 's the pity that it should be so -- not that I should be strong and hearty for my years , I mean , but that they should be weak and tender .
Parsing [sent. 9833 len. 21]: I ask your pardon though , ' said the old man , ` if I spoke rather rough at first .
Parsing [sent. 9834 len. 31]: My eyes are not good at night -- that 's neither age nor illness ; they never were -- and I did n't see you were a stranger . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9835 len. 44]: I am sorry to call you from your bed , ' said Kit , ` but those gentlemen you may see by the churchyard gate , are strangers too , who have just arrived from a long journey , and seek the parsonage-house .
Parsing [sent. 9836 len. 7]: You can direct us ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9837 len. 34]: I should be able to , ' answered the old man , in a trembling voice , ` for , come next summer , I have been sexton here , good fifty years .
Parsing [sent. 9838 len. 11]: The right hand path , friend , is the road .
Parsing [sent. 9839 len. 15]: -- There is no ill news for our good gentleman , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 9840 len. 31]: Kit thanked him , and made him a hasty answer in the negative ; he was turning back , when his attention was caught by the voice of a child .
Parsing [sent. 9841 len. 14]: Looking up , he saw a very little creature at a neighbouring window .
Parsing [sent. 9842 len. 6]: ` What is that ? '
Parsing [sent. 9843 len. 6]: cried the child , earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 9844 len. 7]: ` Has my dream come true ?
Parsing [sent. 9845 len. 14]: Pray speak to me , whoever that is , awake and up . '
Parsing [sent. 9846 len. 5]: ` Poor boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 9847 len. 17]: said the sexton , before Kit could answer , ` how goes it , darling ? '
Parsing [sent. 9848 len. 8]: ` Has my dream come true ? '
Parsing [sent. 9849 len. 22]: exclaimed the child again , in a voice so fervent that it might have thrilled to the heart of any listener .
Parsing [sent. 9850 len. 9]: ` But no , that can never be !
Parsing [sent. 9851 len. 7]: How could it be -- Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9852 len. 6]: how could it ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 9853 len. 10]: I guess his meaning , ' said the sexton .
Parsing [sent. 9854 len. 9]: ` To bed again , poor boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 9855 len. 4]: ` Ay ! '
Parsing [sent. 9856 len. 11]: cried the child , in a burst of despair . '
Parsing [sent. 9857 len. 18]: I knew it could never be , I felt too sure of that , before I asked !
Parsing [sent. 9858 len. 15]: But , all to-night , and last night too , it was the same .
Parsing [sent. 9859 len. 13]: I never fall asleep , but that cruel dream comes back . '
Parsing [sent. 9860 len. 14]: ` Try to sleep again , ' said the old man , soothingly .
Parsing [sent. 9861 len. 8]: ` It will go in time . '
Parsing [sent. 9862 len. 29]: ` No no , I would rather that it staid -- cruel as it is , I would rather that it staid , ' rejoined the child . '
Parsing [sent. 9863 len. 24]: I am not afraid to have it in my sleep , but I am so sad -- so very , very sad . '
Parsing [sent. 9864 len. 20]: The old man blessed him , the child in tears replied Good night , and Kit was again alone .
Parsing [sent. 9865 len. 33]: He hurried back , moved by what he had heard , though more by the child 's manner than by anything he had said , as his meaning was hidden from him .
Parsing [sent. 9866 len. 17]: They took the path indicated by the sexton , and soon arrived before the parsonage wall .
Parsing [sent. 9867 len. 29]: Turning round to look about them when they had got thus far , they saw , among some ruined buildings at a distance , one single solitary light .
Parsing [sent. 9868 len. 28]: It shone from what appeared to be an old oriel window , and being surrounded by the deep shadows of overhanging walls , sparkled like a star .
Parsing [sent. 9869 len. 37]: Bright and glimmering as the stars above their heads , lonely and motionless as they , it seemed to claim some kindred with the eternal lamps of Heaven , and to burn in fellowship with them .
Parsing [sent. 9870 len. 7]: ` What light is that ! '
Parsing [sent. 9871 len. 5]: said the younger brother .
Parsing [sent. 9872 len. 18]: ` It is surely , ' said Mr Garland , ` in the ruin where they live .
Parsing [sent. 9873 len. 8]: I see no other ruin hereabouts . '
Parsing [sent. 9874 len. 61]: ` They can not , ' returned the brother hastily , ` be waking at this late hour -- ' Kit interposed directly , and begged that , while they rang and waited at the gate , they would let him make his way to where this light was shining , and try to ascertain if any people were about .
Parsing [sent. 9875 len. 29]: Obtaining the permission he desired , he darted off with breathless eagerness , and , still carrying the birdcage in his hand , made straight towards the spot .
Parsing [sent. 9876 len. 29]: It was not easy to hold that pace among the graves , and at another time he might have gone more slowly , or round by the path .
Parsing [sent. 9877 len. 26]: Unmindful of all obstacles , however , he pressed forward without slackening his speed , and soon arrived within a few yards of the window .
Parsing [sent. 9878 len. 26]: He approached as softly as he could , and advancing so near the wall as to brush the whitened ivy with his dress , listened .
Parsing [sent. 9879 len. 6]: There was no sound inside .
Parsing [sent. 9880 len. 8]: The church itself was not more quiet .
Parsing [sent. 9881 len. 11]: Touching the glass with his cheek , he listened again .
Parsing [sent. 9882 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 9883 len. 32]: And yet there was such a silence all around , that he felt sure he could have heard even the breathing of a sleeper , if there had been one there .
Parsing [sent. 9884 len. 22]: A strange circumstance , a light in such a place at that time of night , with no one near it .
Parsing [sent. 9885 len. 21]: A curtain was drawn across the lower portion of the window , and he could not see into the room .
Parsing [sent. 9886 len. 11]: But there was no shadow thrown upon it from within .
Parsing [sent. 9887 len. 44]: To have gained a footing on the wall and tried to look in from above , would have been attended with some danger -- certainly with some noise , and the chance of terrifying the child , if that really were her habitation .
Parsing [sent. 9888 len. 14]: Again and again he listened ; again and again the same wearisome blank .
Parsing [sent. 9889 len. 26]: Leaving the spot with slow and cautious steps , and skirting the ruin for a few paces , he came at length to a door .
Parsing [sent. 9890 len. 3]: He knocked .
Parsing [sent. 9891 len. 3]: No answer .
Parsing [sent. 9892 len. 8]: But there was a curious noise inside .
Parsing [sent. 9893 len. 9]: It was difficult to determine what it was .
Parsing [sent. 9894 len. 26]: It bore a resemblance to the low moaning of one in pain , but it was not that , being far too regular and constant .
Parsing [sent. 9895 len. 32]: Now it seemed a kind of song , now a wail -- seemed , that is , to his changing fancy , for the sound itself was never changed or checked .
Parsing [sent. 9896 len. 23]: It was unlike anything he had ever heard ; and in its tone there was something fearful , chilling , and unearthly .
Parsing [sent. 9897 len. 22]: The listener 's blood ran colder now than ever it had done in frost and snow , but he knocked again .
Parsing [sent. 9898 len. 14]: There was no answer , and the sound went on without any interruption .
Parsing [sent. 9899 len. 17]: He laid his hand softly upon the latch , and put his knee against the door .
Parsing [sent. 9900 len. 19]: It was secured on the inside , but yielded to the pressure , and turned upon its hinges .
Parsing [sent. 9901 len. 15]: He saw the glimmering of a fire upon the old walls , and entered .
Parsing [sent. 9902 len. 43]: Chapter 71 The dull , red glow of a wood fire -- for no lamp or candle burnt within the room -- showed him a figure , seated on the hearth with its back towards him , bending over the fitful light .
Parsing [sent. 9903 len. 11]: The attitude was that of one who sought the heat .
Parsing [sent. 9904 len. 8]: It was , and yet was not .
Parsing [sent. 9905 len. 35]: The stooping posture and the cowering form were there , but no hands were stretched out to meet the grateful warmth , no shrug or shiver compared its luxury with the piercing cold outside .
Parsing [sent. 9906 len. 45]: With limbs huddled together , head bowed down , arms crossed upon the breast , and fingers tightly clenched , it rocked to and fro upon its seat without a moment 's pause , accompanying the action with the mournful sound he had heard .
Parsing [sent. 9907 len. 19]: The heavy door had closed behind him on his entrance , with a crash that made him start .
Parsing [sent. 9908 len. 25]: The figure neither spoke , nor turned to look , nor gave in any other way the faintest sign of having heard the noise .
Parsing [sent. 9909 len. 24]: The form was that of an old man , his white head akin in colour to the mouldering embers upon which he gazed .
Parsing [sent. 9910 len. 29]: He , and the failing light and dying fire , the time-worn room , the solitude , the wasted life , and gloom , were all in fellowship .
Parsing [sent. 9911 len. 8]: Ashes , and dust , and ruin !
Parsing [sent. 9912 len. 19]: Kit tried to speak , and did pronounce some words , though what they were he scarcely knew .
Parsing [sent. 9913 len. 31]: Still the same terrible low cry went on -- still the same rocking in the chair -- the same stricken figure was there , unchanged and heedless of his presence .
Parsing [sent. 9914 len. 35]: He had his hand upon the latch , when something in the form -- distinctly seen as one log broke and fell , and , as it fell , blazed up -- arrested it .
Parsing [sent. 9915 len. 18]: He returned to where he had stood before -- advanced a pace -- another -- another still .
Parsing [sent. 9916 len. 8]: Another , and he saw the face .
Parsing [sent. 9917 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 9918 len. 10]: Changed as it was , he knew it well .
Parsing [sent. 9919 len. 4]: ` Master ! '
Parsing [sent. 9920 len. 13]: he cried , stooping on one knee and catching at his hand .
Parsing [sent. 9921 len. 4]: ` Dear master .
Parsing [sent. 9922 len. 5]: Speak to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 9923 len. 20]: The old man turned slowly towards him ; and muttered in a hollow voice , ` This is another !
Parsing [sent. 9924 len. 12]: -- How many of these spirits there have been to-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 9925 len. 6]: ` No spirit , master .
Parsing [sent. 9926 len. 7]: No one but your old servant .
Parsing [sent. 9927 len. 9]: You know me now , I am sure ?
Parsing [sent. 9928 len. 12]: Miss Nell -- where is she -- where is she ? '
Parsing [sent. 9929 len. 7]: ` They all say that ! '
Parsing [sent. 9930 len. 5]: cried the old man .
Parsing [sent. 9931 len. 8]: ` They all ask the same question .
Parsing [sent. 9932 len. 4]: A spirit ! '
Parsing [sent. 9933 len. 6]: ` Where is she ? '
Parsing [sent. 9934 len. 3]: demanded Kit .
Parsing [sent. 9935 len. 15]: ` Oh tell me but that , -- but that , dear master ! '
Parsing [sent. 9936 len. 11]: ` She is asleep -- yonder -- in there . '
Parsing [sent. 9937 len. 5]: ` Thank God ! '
Parsing [sent. 9938 len. 3]: ` Aye !
Parsing [sent. 9939 len. 4]: Thank God ! '
Parsing [sent. 9940 len. 6]: returned the old man . '
Parsing [sent. 9941 len. 26]: I have prayed to Him , many , and many , and many a livelong night , when she has been asleep , He knows .
Parsing [sent. 9942 len. 2]: Hark !
Parsing [sent. 9943 len. 6]: Did she call ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9944 len. 6]: I heard no voice . '
Parsing [sent. 9945 len. 4]: ` You did .
Parsing [sent. 9946 len. 5]: You hear her now .
Parsing [sent. 9947 len. 12]: Do you tell me that you do n't hear THAT ? '
Parsing [sent. 9948 len. 8]: He started up , and listened again .
Parsing [sent. 9949 len. 5]: ` Nor that ? '
Parsing [sent. 9950 len. 20]: he cried , with a triumphant smile , ` Can any body know that voice so well as I ?
Parsing [sent. 9951 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 9952 len. 3]: Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 9953 len. 14]: Motioning to him to be silent , he stole away into another chamber .
Parsing [sent. 9954 len. 29]: After a short absence -LRB- during which he could be heard to speak in a softened soothing tone -RRB- he returned , bearing in his hand a lamp .
Parsing [sent. 9955 len. 10]: ` She is still asleep , ' he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 9956 len. 5]: ` You were right .
Parsing [sent. 9957 len. 13]: She did not call -- unless she did so in her slumber .
Parsing [sent. 9958 len. 45]: She has called to me in her sleep before now , sir ; as I have sat by , watching , I have seen her lips move , and have known , though no sound came from them , that she spoke of me .
Parsing [sent. 9959 len. 19]: I feared the light might dazzle her eyes and wake her , so I brought it here . '
Parsing [sent. 9960 len. 43]: He spoke rather to himself than to the visitor , but when he had put the lamp upon the table , he took it up , as if impelled by some momentary recollection or curiosity , and held it near his face .
Parsing [sent. 9961 len. 21]: Then , as if forgetting his motive in the very action , he turned away and put it down again .
Parsing [sent. 9962 len. 15]: ` She is sleeping soundly , ' he said ; ` but no wonder .
Parsing [sent. 9963 len. 33]: Angel hands have strewn the ground deep with snow , that the lightest footstep may be lighter yet ; and the very birds are dead , that they may not wake her .
Parsing [sent. 9964 len. 8]: She used to feed them , Sir .
Parsing [sent. 9965 len. 15]: Though never so cold and hungry , the timid things would fly from us .
Parsing [sent. 9966 len. 7]: They never flew from her ! '
Parsing [sent. 9967 len. 19]: Again he stopped to listen , and scarcely drawing breath , listened for a long , long time .
Parsing [sent. 9968 len. 35]: That fancy past , he opened an old chest , took out some clothes as fondly as if they had been living things , and began to smooth and brush them with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 9969 len. 33]: ` Why dost thou lie so idle there , dear Nell , ' he murmured , ` when there are bright red berries out of doors waiting for thee to pluck them !
Parsing [sent. 9970 len. 28]: Why dost thou lie so idle there , when thy little friends come creeping to the door , crying `` where is Nell -- sweet Nell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9971 len. 14]: -- and sob , and weep , because they do not see thee .
Parsing [sent. 9972 len. 7]: She was always gentle with children .
Parsing [sent. 9973 len. 20]: The wildest would do her bidding -- she had a tender way with them , indeed she had ! '
Parsing [sent. 9974 len. 7]: Kit had no power to speak .
Parsing [sent. 9975 len. 7]: His eyes were filled with tears .
Parsing [sent. 9976 len. 11]: ` Her little homely dress , -- her favourite ! '
Parsing [sent. 9977 len. 19]: cried the old man , pressing it to his breast , and patting it with his shrivelled hand .
Parsing [sent. 9978 len. 9]: ` She will miss it when she wakes .
Parsing [sent. 9979 len. 19]: They have hid it here in sport , but she shall have it -- she shall have it .
Parsing [sent. 9980 len. 14]: I would not vex my darling , for the wide world 's riches .
Parsing [sent. 9981 len. 23]: See here -- these shoes -- how worn they are -- she kept them to remind her of our last long journey .
Parsing [sent. 9982 len. 12]: You see where the little feet went bare upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 9983 len. 15]: They told me , afterwards , that the stones had cut and bruised them .
Parsing [sent. 9984 len. 6]: She never told me that .
Parsing [sent. 9985 len. 8]: No , no , God bless her !
Parsing [sent. 9986 len. 41]: and , I have remembered since , she walked behind me , sir , that I might not see how lame she was -- but yet she had my hand in hers , and seemed to lead me still . '
Parsing [sent. 9987 len. 35]: He pressed them to his lips , and having carefully put them back again , went on communing with himself -- looking wistfully from time to time towards the chamber he had lately visited .
Parsing [sent. 9988 len. 16]: ` She was not wont to be a lie-abed ; but she was well then .
Parsing [sent. 9989 len. 5]: We must have patience .
Parsing [sent. 9990 len. 26]: When she is well again , she will rise early , as she used to do , and ramble abroad in the healthy morning time .
Parsing [sent. 9991 len. 27]: I often tried to track the way she had gone , but her small footstep left no print upon the dewy ground , to guide me .
Parsing [sent. 9992 len. 4]: Who is that ?
Parsing [sent. 9993 len. 4]: Shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 9994 len. 2]: Quick !
Parsing [sent. 9995 len. 20]: -- Have we not enough to do to drive away that marble cold , and keep her warm ! '
Parsing [sent. 9996 len. 22]: The door was indeed opened , for the entrance of Mr Garland and his friend , accompanied by two other persons .
Parsing [sent. 9997 len. 9]: These were the schoolmaster , and the bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 9998 len. 9]: The former held a light in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 9999 len. 32]: He had , it seemed , but gone to his own cottage to replenish the exhausted lamp , at the moment when Kit came up and found the old man alone .
Parsing [sent. 10000 len. 68]: He softened again at sight of these two friends , and , laying aside the angry manner -- if to anything so feeble and so sad the term can be applied -- in which he had spoken when the door opened , resumed his former seat , and subsided , by little and little into the old action , and the old , dull , wandering sound .
Parsing [sent. 10001 len. 10]: Of the strangers , he took no heed whatever .
Parsing [sent. 10002 len. 14]: He had seen them , but appeared quite incapable of interest or curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 10003 len. 6]: The younger brother stood apart .
Parsing [sent. 10004 len. 17]: The bachelor drew a chair towards the old man , and sat down close beside him .
Parsing [sent. 10005 len. 10]: After a long silence , he ventured to speak .
Parsing [sent. 10006 len. 10]: ` Another night , and not in bed ! '
Parsing [sent. 10007 len. 18]: he said softly ; ' I hoped you would be more mindful of your promise to me .
Parsing [sent. 10008 len. 9]: Why do you not take some rest ? '
Parsing [sent. 10009 len. 12]: ` Sleep has left me , ' returned the old man .
Parsing [sent. 10010 len. 8]: ` It is all with her ! '
Parsing [sent. 10011 len. 20]: ` It would pain her very much to know that you were watching thus , ' said the bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 10012 len. 10]: ` You would not give her pain ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 10013 len. 15]: I am not so sure of that , if it would only rouse her .
Parsing [sent. 10014 len. 7]: She has slept so very long .
Parsing [sent. 10015 len. 9]: And yet I am rash to say so .
Parsing [sent. 10016 len. 11]: It is a good and happy sleep -- eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 10017 len. 10]: ` Indeed it is , ' returned the bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 10018 len. 9]: ` Indeed , indeed , it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 10019 len. 5]: ` That 's well !
Parsing [sent. 10020 len. 11]: -- and the waking -- ' faltered the old man .
Parsing [sent. 10021 len. 4]: ` Happy too .
Parsing [sent. 10022 len. 13]: Happier than tongue can tell , or heart of man conceive . '
Parsing [sent. 10023 len. 21]: They watched him as he rose and stole on tiptoe to the other chamber where the lamp had been replaced .
Parsing [sent. 10024 len. 11]: They listened as he spoke again within its silent walls .
Parsing [sent. 10025 len. 19]: They looked into the faces of each other , and no man 's cheek was free from tears .
Parsing [sent. 10026 len. 19]: He came back , whispering that she was still asleep , but that he thought she had moved .
Parsing [sent. 10027 len. 32]: It was her hand , he said -- a little -- a very , very little -- but he was pretty sure she had moved it -- perhaps in seeking his .
Parsing [sent. 10028 len. 18]: He had known her do that , before now , though in the deepest sleep the while .
Parsing [sent. 10029 len. 30]: And when he had said this , he dropped into his chair again , and clasping his hands above his head , uttered a cry never to be forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 10030 len. 21]: The poor schoolmaster motioned to the bachelor that he would come on the other side , and speak to him .
Parsing [sent. 10031 len. 22]: They gently unlocked his fingers , which he had twisted in his grey hair , and pressed them in their own .
Parsing [sent. 10032 len. 16]: ` He will hear me , ' said the schoolmaster , ' I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 10033 len. 12]: He will hear either me or you if we beseech him .
Parsing [sent. 10034 len. 9]: She would , at all times . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10035 len. 17]: I will hear any voice she liked to hear , ' cried the old man . '
Parsing [sent. 10036 len. 8]: I love all she loved ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 10037 len. 11]: I know you do , ' returned the schoolmaster . '
Parsing [sent. 10038 len. 6]: I am certain of it .
Parsing [sent. 10039 len. 34]: Think of her ; think of all the sorrows and afflictions you have shared together ; of all the trials , and all the peaceful pleasures , you have jointly known . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10040 len. 3]: I do .
Parsing [sent. 10041 len. 3]: I do .
Parsing [sent. 10042 len. 8]: I think of nothing else . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10043 len. 34]: I would have you think of nothing else to-night -- of nothing but those things which will soften your heart , dear friend , and open it to old affections and old times .
Parsing [sent. 10044 len. 23]: It is so that she would speak to you herself , and in her name it is that I speak now . '
Parsing [sent. 10045 len. 14]: ` You do well to speak softly , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 10046 len. 7]: ` We will not wake her .
Parsing [sent. 10047 len. 16]: I should be glad to see her eyes again , and to see her smile .
Parsing [sent. 10048 len. 17]: There is a smile upon her young face now , but it is fixed and changeless .
Parsing [sent. 10049 len. 8]: I would have it come and go .
Parsing [sent. 10050 len. 9]: That shall be in Heaven 's good time .
Parsing [sent. 10051 len. 7]: We will not wake her . '
Parsing [sent. 10052 len. 57]: ` Let us not talk of her in her sleep , but as she used to be when you were Journeying together , far away -- as she was at home , in the old house from which you fled together -- as she was , in the old cheerful time , ' said the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 10053 len. 20]: ` She was always cheerful -- very cheerful , ' cried the old man , looking steadfastly at him .
Parsing [sent. 10054 len. 27]: ` There was ever something mild and quiet about her , I remember , from the first ; but she was of a happy nature . '
Parsing [sent. 10055 len. 27]: ` We have heard you say , ' pursued the schoolmaster , ` that in this and in all goodness , she was like her mother .
Parsing [sent. 10056 len. 10]: You can think of , and remember her ? '
Parsing [sent. 10057 len. 11]: He maintained his steadfast look , but gave no answer .
Parsing [sent. 10058 len. 12]: ` Or even one before her , ' said the bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 10059 len. 44]: ` it is many years ago , and affliction makes the time longer , but you have not forgotten her whose death contributed to make this child so dear to you , even before you knew her worth or could read her heart ?
Parsing [sent. 10060 len. 37]: Say , that you could carry back your thoughts to very distant days -- to the time of your early life -- when , unlike this fair flower , you did not pass your youth alone .
Parsing [sent. 10061 len. 24]: Say , that you could remember , long ago , another child who loved you dearly , you being but a child yourself .
Parsing [sent. 10062 len. 120]: Say , that you had a brother , long forgotten , long unseen , long separated from you , who now , at last , in your utmost need came back to comfort and console you -- ' ` To be to you what you were once to him , ' cried the younger , falling on his knee before him ; ` to repay your old affection , brother dear , by constant care , solicitude , and love ; to be , at your right hand , what he has never ceased to be when oceans rolled between us ; to call to witness his unchanging truth and mindfulness of bygone days , whole years of desolation .
Parsing [sent. 10063 len. 60]: Give me but one word of recognition , brother -- and never -- no never , in the brightest moment of our youngest days , when , poor silly boys , we thought to pass our lives together -- have we been half as dear and precious to each other as we shall be from this time hence ! '
Parsing [sent. 10064 len. 23]: The old man looked from face to face , and his lips moved ; but no sound came from them in reply .
Parsing [sent. 10065 len. 24]: ` If we were knit together then , ' pursued the younger brother , ` what will be the bond between us now !
Parsing [sent. 10066 len. 33]: Our love and fellowship began in childhood , when life was all before us , and will be resumed when we have proved it , and are but children at the last .
Parsing [sent. 10067 len. 127]: As many restless spirits , who have hunted fortune , fame , or pleasure through the world , retire in their decline to where they first drew breath , vainly seeking to be children once again before they die , so we , less fortunate than they in early life , but happier in its closing scenes , will set up our rest again among our boyish haunts , and going home with no hope realised , that had its growth in manhood -- carrying back nothing that we brought away , but our old yearnings to each other -- saving no fragment from the wreck of life , but that which first endeared it -- may be , indeed , but children as at first .
Parsing [sent. 10068 len. 43]: And even , ' he added in an altered voice , ` even if what I dread to name has come to pass -- even if that be so , or is to be -LRB- which Heaven forbid and spare us ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 10069 len. 21]: -- still , dear brother , we are not apart , and have that comfort in our great affliction . '
Parsing [sent. 10070 len. 22]: By little and little , the old man had drawn back towards the inner chamber , while these words were spoken .
Parsing [sent. 10071 len. 12]: He pointed there , as he replied , with trembling lips .
Parsing [sent. 10072 len. 12]: ` You plot among you to wean my heart from her .
Parsing [sent. 10073 len. 12]: You never will do that -- never while I have life .
Parsing [sent. 10074 len. 18]: I have no relative or friend but her -- I never had -- I never will have .
Parsing [sent. 10075 len. 8]: She is all in all to me .
Parsing [sent. 10076 len. 10]: It is too late to part us now . '
Parsing [sent. 10077 len. 22]: Waving them off with his hand , and calling softly to her as he went , he stole into the room .
Parsing [sent. 10078 len. 29]: They who were left behind , drew close together , and after a few whispered words -- not unbroken by emotion , or easily uttered -- followed him .
Parsing [sent. 10079 len. 28]: They moved so gently , that their footsteps made no noise ; but there were sobs from among the group , and sounds of grief and mourning .
Parsing [sent. 10080 len. 5]: For she was dead .
Parsing [sent. 10081 len. 12]: There , upon her little bed , she lay at rest .
Parsing [sent. 10082 len. 8]: The solemn stillness was no marvel now .
Parsing [sent. 10083 len. 4]: She was dead .
Parsing [sent. 10084 len. 20]: No sleep so beautiful and calm , so free from trace of pain , so fair to look upon .
Parsing [sent. 10085 len. 28]: She seemed a creature fresh from the hand of God , and waiting for the breath of life ; not one who had lived and suffered death .
Parsing [sent. 10086 len. 26]: Her couch was dressed with here and there some winter berries and green leaves , gathered in a spot she had been used to favour .
Parsing [sent. 10087 len. 24]: ` When I die , put near me something that has loved the light , and had the sky above it always . '
Parsing [sent. 10088 len. 5]: Those were her words .
Parsing [sent. 10089 len. 4]: She was dead .
Parsing [sent. 10090 len. 11]: Dear , gentle , patient , noble Nell was dead .
Parsing [sent. 10091 len. 39]: Her little bird -- a poor slight thing the pressure of a finger would have crushed -- was stirring nimbly in its cage ; and the strong heart of its child mistress was mute and motionless for ever .
Parsing [sent. 10092 len. 15]: Where were the traces of her early cares , her sufferings , and fatigues ?
Parsing [sent. 10093 len. 3]: All gone .
Parsing [sent. 10094 len. 24]: Sorrow was dead indeed in her , but peace and perfect happiness were born ; imaged in her tranquil beauty and profound repose .
Parsing [sent. 10095 len. 13]: And still her former self lay there , unaltered in this change .
Parsing [sent. 10096 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 10097 len. 66]: The old fireside had smiled upon that same sweet face ; it had passed , like a dream , through haunts of misery and care ; at the door of the poor schoolmaster on the summer evening , before the furnace fire upon the cold wet night , at the still bedside of the dying boy , there had been the same mild lovely look .
Parsing [sent. 10098 len. 13]: So shall we know the angels in their majesty , after death .
Parsing [sent. 10099 len. 24]: The old man held one languid arm in his , and had the small hand tight folded to his breast , for warmth .
Parsing [sent. 10100 len. 28]: It was the hand she had stretched out to him with her last smile -- the hand that had led him on , through all their wanderings .
Parsing [sent. 10101 len. 52]: Ever and anon he pressed it to his lips ; then hugged it to his breast again , murmuring that it was warmer now ; and , as he said it , he looked , in agony , to those who stood around , as if imploring them to help her .
Parsing [sent. 10102 len. 14]: She was dead , and past all help , or need of it .
Parsing [sent. 10103 len. 57]: The ancient rooms she had seemed to fill with life , even while her own was waning fast -- the garden she had tended -- the eyes she had gladdened -- the noiseless haunts of many a thoughtful hour -- the paths she had trodden as it were but yesterday -- could know her never more .
Parsing [sent. 10104 len. 40]: ` It is not , ' said the schoolmaster , as he bent down to kiss her on the cheek , and gave his tears free vent , ` it is not on earth that Heaven 's justice ends .
Parsing [sent. 10105 len. 49]: Think what earth is , compared with the World to which her young spirit has winged its early flight ; and say , if one deliberate wish expressed in solemn terms above this bed could call her back to life , which of us would utter it ! '
Parsing [sent. 10106 len. 27]: Chapter 72 When morning came , and they could speak more calmly on the subject of their grief , they heard how her life had closed .
Parsing [sent. 10107 len. 7]: She had been dead two days .
Parsing [sent. 10108 len. 17]: They were all about her at the time , knowing that the end was drawing on .
Parsing [sent. 10109 len. 6]: She died soon after daybreak .
Parsing [sent. 10110 len. 27]: They had read and talked to her in the earlier portion of the night , but as the hours crept on , she sunk to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 10111 len. 52]: They could tell , by what she faintly uttered in her dreams , that they were of her journeyings with the old man ; they were of no painful scenes , but of people who had helped and used them kindly , for she often said ` God bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 10112 len. 4]: with great fervour .
Parsing [sent. 10113 len. 25]: Waking , she never wandered in her mind but once , and that was of beautiful music which she said was in the air .
Parsing [sent. 10114 len. 3]: God knows .
Parsing [sent. 10115 len. 5]: It may have been .
Parsing [sent. 10116 len. 22]: Opening her eyes at last , from a very quiet sleep , she begged that they would kiss her once again .
Parsing [sent. 10117 len. 43]: That done , she turned to the old man with a lovely smile upon her face -- such , they said , as they had never seen , and never could forget -- and clung with both her arms about his neck .
Parsing [sent. 10118 len. 12]: They did not know that she was dead , at first .
Parsing [sent. 10119 len. 22]: She had spoken very often of the two sisters , who , she said , were like dear friends to her .
Parsing [sent. 10120 len. 31]: She wished they could be told how much she thought about them , and how she had watched them as they walked together , by the river side at night .
Parsing [sent. 10121 len. 15]: She would like to see poor Kit , she had often said of late .
Parsing [sent. 10122 len. 12]: She wished there was somebody to take her love to Kit .
Parsing [sent. 10123 len. 25]: And , even then , she never thought or spoke about him , but with something of her old , clear , merry laugh .
Parsing [sent. 10124 len. 46]: For the rest , she had never murmured or complained ; but with a quiet mind , and manner quite unaltered -- save that she every day became more earnest and more grateful to them -- faded like the light upon a summer 's evening .
Parsing [sent. 10125 len. 35]: The child who had been her little friend came there , almost as soon as it was day , with an offering of dried flowers which he begged them to lay upon her breast .
Parsing [sent. 10126 len. 46]: It was he who had come to the window overnight and spoken to the sexton , and they saw in the snow traces of small feet , where he had been lingering near the room in which she lay , before he went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 10127 len. 23]: He had a fancy , it seemed , that they had left her there alone ; and could not bear the thought .
Parsing [sent. 10128 len. 26]: He told them of his dream again , and that it was of her being restored to them , just as she used to be .
Parsing [sent. 10129 len. 52]: He begged hard to see her , saying that he would be very quiet , and that they need not fear his being alarmed , for he had sat alone by his young brother all day long when he was dead , and had felt glad to be so near him .
Parsing [sent. 10130 len. 28]: They let him have his wish ; and indeed he kept his word , and was , in his childish way , a lesson to them all .
Parsing [sent. 10131 len. 23]: Up to that time , the old man had not spoken once -- except to her -- or stirred from the bedside .
Parsing [sent. 10132 len. 31]: But , when he saw her little favourite , he was moved as they had not seen him yet , and made as though he would have him come nearer .
Parsing [sent. 10133 len. 39]: Then , pointing to the bed , he burst into tears for the first time , and they who stood by , knowing that the sight of this child had done him good , left them alone together .
Parsing [sent. 10134 len. 30]: Soothing him with his artless talk of her , the child persuaded him to take some rest , to walk abroad , to do almost as he desired him .
Parsing [sent. 10135 len. 38]: And when the day came on , which must remove her in her earthly shape from earthly eyes for ever , he led him away , that he might not know when she was taken from him .
Parsing [sent. 10136 len. 12]: They were to gather fresh leaves and berries for her bed .
Parsing [sent. 10137 len. 42]: It was Sunday -- a bright , clear , wintry afternoon -- and as they traversed the village street , those who were walking in their path drew back to make way for them , and gave them a softened greeting .
Parsing [sent. 10138 len. 27]: Some shook the old man kindly by the hand , some stood uncovered while he tottered by , and many cried ` God help him ! '
Parsing [sent. 10139 len. 5]: as he passed along .
Parsing [sent. 10140 len. 4]: ` Neighbour ! '
Parsing [sent. 10141 len. 31]: said the old man , stopping at the cottage where his young guide 's mother dwelt , ` how is it that the folks are nearly all in black to-day ?
Parsing [sent. 10142 len. 17]: I have seen a mourning ribbon or a piece of crape on almost every one . '
Parsing [sent. 10143 len. 9]: She could not tell , the woman said .
Parsing [sent. 10144 len. 13]: ` Why , you yourself -- you wear the colour too ? '
Parsing [sent. 10145 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 10146 len. 12]: ` Windows are closed that never used to be by day .
Parsing [sent. 10147 len. 6]: What does this mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 10148 len. 9]: Again the woman said she could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 10149 len. 14]: ` We must go back , ' said the old man , hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 10150 len. 9]: ` We must see what this is . '
Parsing [sent. 10151 len. 13]: ` No , no , ' cried the child , detaining him .
Parsing [sent. 10152 len. 6]: ` Remember what you promised .
Parsing [sent. 10153 len. 34]: Our way is to the old green lane , where she and I so often were , and where you found us , more than once , making those garlands for her garden .
Parsing [sent. 10154 len. 6]: Do not turn back ! '
Parsing [sent. 10155 len. 7]: ` Where is she now ? '
Parsing [sent. 10156 len. 5]: said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 10157 len. 6]: ` Tell me that . '
Parsing [sent. 10158 len. 7]: ` Do you not know ? '
Parsing [sent. 10159 len. 4]: returned the child .
Parsing [sent. 10160 len. 12]: ` Did we not leave her , but just now ? '
Parsing [sent. 10161 len. 3]: ` True .
Parsing [sent. 10162 len. 2]: True .
Parsing [sent. 10163 len. 10]: It was her we left -- was it ? '
Parsing [sent. 10164 len. 32]: He pressed his hand upon his brow , looked vacantly round , and as if impelled by a sudden thought , crossed the road , and entered the sexton 's house .
Parsing [sent. 10165 len. 11]: He and his deaf assistant were sitting before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 10166 len. 10]: Both rose up , on seeing who it was .
Parsing [sent. 10167 len. 12]: The child made a hasty sign to them with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 10168 len. 22]: It was the action of an instant , but that , and the old man 's look , were quite enough .
Parsing [sent. 10169 len. 17]: ` Do you -- do you bury any one to-day -RRB- ' he said , eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 10170 len. 5]: ` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 10171 len. 8]: Who should we bury , Sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 10172 len. 4]: returned the sexton .
Parsing [sent. 10173 len. 6]: ` Aye , who indeed !
Parsing [sent. 10174 len. 9]: I say with you , who indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 10175 len. 17]: ` It is a holiday with us , good Sir , ' returned the sexton mildly .
Parsing [sent. 10176 len. 10]: ` We have no work to do to-day . '
Parsing [sent. 10177 len. 22]: ` Why then , I 'll go where you will , ' said the old man , turning to the child .
Parsing [sent. 10178 len. 10]: ` You 're sure of what you tell me ?
Parsing [sent. 10179 len. 6]: You would not deceive me ?
Parsing [sent. 10180 len. 16]: I am changed , even in the little time since you last saw me . '
Parsing [sent. 10181 len. 24]: ` Go thy ways with him , Sir , ' cried the sexton , ` and Heaven be with ye both ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 10182 len. 13]: I am quite ready , ' said the old man , meekly .
Parsing [sent. 10183 len. 16]: ` Come , boy , come -- ' and so submitted to be led away .
Parsing [sent. 10184 len. 47]: And now the bell -- the bell she had so often heard , by night and day , and listened to with solemn pleasure almost as a living voice -- rung its remorseless toll , for her , so young , so beautiful , so good .
Parsing [sent. 10185 len. 49]: Decrepit age , and vigorous life , and blooming youth , and helpless infancy , poured forth -- on crutches , in the pride of strength and health , in the full blush of promise , in the mere dawn of life -- to gather round her tomb .
Parsing [sent. 10186 len. 58]: Old men were there , whose eyes were dim and senses failing -- grandmothers , who might have died ten years ago , and still been old -- the deaf , the blind , the lame , the palsied , the living dead in many shapes and forms , to see the closing of that early grave .
Parsing [sent. 10187 len. 20]: What was the death it would shut in , to that which still could crawl and creep above it !
Parsing [sent. 10188 len. 27]: Along the crowded path they bore her now ; pure as the newly-fallen snow that covered it ; whose day on earth had been as fleeting .
Parsing [sent. 10189 len. 35]: Under the porch , where she had sat when Heaven in its mercy brought her to that peaceful spot , she passed again ; and the old church received her in its quiet shade .
Parsing [sent. 10190 len. 28]: They carried her to one old nook , where she had many and many a time sat musing , and laid their burden softly on the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 10191 len. 35]: The light streamed on it through the coloured window -- a window , where the boughs of trees were ever rustling in the summer , and where the birds sang sweetly all day long .
Parsing [sent. 10192 len. 26]: With every breath of air that stirred among those branches in the sunshine , some trembling , changing light , would fall upon her grave .
Parsing [sent. 10193 len. 12]: Earth to earth , ashes to ashes , dust to dust !
Parsing [sent. 10194 len. 17]: Many a young hand dropped in its little wreath , many a stifled sob was heard .
Parsing [sent. 10195 len. 12]: Some -- and they were not a few -- knelt down .
Parsing [sent. 10196 len. 9]: All were sincere and truthful in their sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 10197 len. 26]: The service done , the mourners stood apart , and the villagers closed round to look into the grave before the pavement-stone should be replaced .
Parsing [sent. 10198 len. 37]: One called to mind how he had seen her sitting on that very spot , and how her book had fallen on her lap , and she was gazing with a pensive face upon the sky .
Parsing [sent. 10199 len. 72]: Another told , how he had wondered much that one so delicate as she , should be so bold ; how she had never feared to enter the church alone at night , but had loved to linger there when all was quiet , and even to climb the tower stair , with no more light than that of the moon rays stealing through the loopholes in the thick old wall .
Parsing [sent. 10200 len. 45]: A whisper went about among the oldest , that she had seen and talked with angels ; and when they called to mind how she had looked , and spoken , and her early death , some thought it might be so , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 10201 len. 48]: Thus , coming to the grave in little knots , and glancing down , and giving place to others , and falling off in whispering groups of three or four , the church was cleared in time , of all but the sexton and the mourning friends .
Parsing [sent. 10202 len. 12]: They saw the vault covered , and the stone fixed down .
Parsing [sent. 10203 len. 107]: Then , when the dusk of evening had come on , and not a sound disturbed the sacred stillness of the place -- when the bright moon poured in her light on tomb and monument , on pillar , wall , and arch , and most of all -LRB- it seemed to them -RRB- upon her quiet grave -- in that calm time , when outward things and inward thoughts teem with assurances of immortality , and worldly hopes and fears are humbled in the dust before them -- then , with tranquil and submissive hearts they turned away , and left the child with God .
Parsing [sent. 10204 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 10205 len. 39]: it is hard to take to heart the lesson that such deaths will teach , but let no man reject it , for it is one that all must learn , and is a mighty , universal Truth .
Parsing [sent. 10206 len. 46]: When Death strikes down the innocent and young , for every fragile form from which he lets the panting spirit free , a hundred virtues rise , in shapes of mercy , charity , and love , to walk the world , and bless it .
Parsing [sent. 10207 len. 22]: Of every tear that sorrowing mortals shed on such green graves , some good is born , some gentler nature comes .
Parsing [sent. 10208 len. 27]: In the Destroyer 's steps there spring up bright creations that defy his power , and his dark path becomes a way of light to Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 10209 len. 10]: It was late when the old man came home .
Parsing [sent. 10210 len. 44]: The boy had led him to his own dwelling , under some pretence , on their way back ; and , rendered drowsy by his long ramble and late want of rest , he had sunk into a deep sleep by the fireside .
Parsing [sent. 10211 len. 14]: He was perfectly exhausted , and they were careful not to rouse him .
Parsing [sent. 10212 len. 19]: The slumber held him a long time , and when he at length awoke the moon was shining .
Parsing [sent. 10213 len. 30]: The younger brother , uneasy at his protracted absence , was watching at the door for his coming , when he appeared in the pathway with his little guide .
Parsing [sent. 10214 len. 29]: He advanced to meet them , and tenderly obliging the old man to lean upon his arm , conducted him with slow and trembling steps towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 10215 len. 8]: He repaired to her chamber , straight .
Parsing [sent. 10216 len. 22]: Not finding what he had left there , he returned with distracted looks to the room in which they were assembled .
Parsing [sent. 10217 len. 15]: From that , he rushed into the schoolmaster 's cottage , calling her name .
Parsing [sent. 10218 len. 18]: They followed close upon him , and when he had vainly searched it , brought him home .
Parsing [sent. 10219 len. 27]: With such persuasive words as pity and affection could suggest , they prevailed upon him to sit among them and hear what they should tell him .
Parsing [sent. 10220 len. 42]: Then endeavouring by every little artifice to prepare his mind for what must come , and dwelling with many fervent words upon the happy lot to which she had been removed , they told him , at last , the truth .
Parsing [sent. 10221 len. 18]: The moment it had passed their lips , he fell down among them like a murdered man .
Parsing [sent. 10222 len. 21]: For many hours , they had little hope of his surviving ; but grief is strong , and he recovered .
Parsing [sent. 10223 len. 121]: If there be any who have never known the blank that follows death -- the weary void -- the sense of desolation that will come upon the strongest minds , when something familiar and beloved is missed at every turn -- the connection between inanimate and senseless things , and the object of recollection , when every household god becomes a monument and every room a grave -- if there be any who have not known this , and proved it by their own experience , they can never faintly guess how , for many days , the old man pined and moped away the time , and wandered here and there as seeking something , and had no comfort .
Parsing [sent. 10224 len. 16]: Whatever power of thought or memory he retained , was all bound up in her .
Parsing [sent. 10225 len. 15]: He never understood , or seemed to care to understand , about his brother .
Parsing [sent. 10226 len. 9]: To every endearment and attention he continued listless .
Parsing [sent. 10227 len. 35]: If they spoke to him on this , or any other theme -- save one -- he would hear them patiently for awhile , then turn away , and go on seeking as before .
Parsing [sent. 10228 len. 20]: On that one theme , which was in his and all their minds , it was impossible to touch .
Parsing [sent. 10229 len. 2]: Dead !
Parsing [sent. 10230 len. 9]: He could not hear or bear the word .
Parsing [sent. 10231 len. 23]: The slightest hint of it would throw him into a paroxysm , like that he had had when it was first spoken .
Parsing [sent. 10232 len. 53]: In what hope he lived , no man could tell ; but that he had some hope of finding her again -- some faint and shadowy hope , deferred from day to day , and making him from day to day more sick and sore at heart -- was plain to all .
Parsing [sent. 10233 len. 26]: They bethought them of a removal from the scene of this last sorrow ; of trying whether change of place would rouse or cheer him .
Parsing [sent. 10234 len. 22]: His brother sought the advice of those who were accounted skilful in such matters , and they came and saw him .
Parsing [sent. 10235 len. 31]: Some of the number staid upon the spot , conversed with him when he would converse , and watched him as he wandered up and down , alone and silent .
Parsing [sent. 10236 len. 18]: Move him where they might , they said , he would ever seek to get back there .
Parsing [sent. 10237 len. 8]: His mind would run upon that spot .
Parsing [sent. 10238 len. 44]: If they confined him closely , and kept a strict guard upon him , they might hold him prisoner , but if he could by any means escape , he would surely wander back to that place , or die upon the road .
Parsing [sent. 10239 len. 19]: The boy , to whom he had submitted at first , had no longer any influence with him .
Parsing [sent. 10240 len. 43]: At times he would suffer the child to walk by his side , or would even take such notice of his presence as giving him his hand , or would stop to kiss his cheek , or pat him on the head .
Parsing [sent. 10241 len. 23]: At other times , he would entreat him -- not unkindly -- to be gone , and would not brook him near .
Parsing [sent. 10242 len. 65]: But , whether alone , or with this pliant friend , or with those who would have given him , at any cost or sacrifice , some consolation or some peace of mind , if happily the means could have been devised ; he was at all times the same -- with no love or care for anything in life -- a broken-hearted man .
Parsing [sent. 10243 len. 52]: At length , they found , one day , that he had risen early , and , with his knapsack on his back , his staff in hand , her own straw hat , and little basket full of such things as she had been used to carry , was gone .
Parsing [sent. 10244 len. 38]: As they were making ready to pursue him far and wide , a frightened schoolboy came who had seen him , but a moment before , sitting in the church -- upon her grave , he said .
Parsing [sent. 10245 len. 22]: They hastened there , and going softly to the door , espied him in the attitude of one who waited patiently .
Parsing [sent. 10246 len. 17]: They did not disturb him then , but kept a watch upon him all that day .
Parsing [sent. 10247 len. 28]: When it grew quite dark , he rose and returned home , and went to bed , murmuring to himself , ` She will come to-morrow ! '
Parsing [sent. 10248 len. 33]: Upon the morrow he was there again from sunrise until night ; and still at night he laid him down to rest , and murmured , ` She will come to-morrow ! '
Parsing [sent. 10249 len. 20]: And thenceforth , every day , and all day long , he waited at her grave , for her .
Parsing [sent. 10250 len. 93]: How many pictures of new journeys over pleasant country , of resting-places under the free broad sky , of rambles in the fields and woods , and paths not often trodden -- how many tones of that one well-remembered voice , how many glimpses of the form , the fluttering dress , the hair that waved so gaily in the wind -- how many visions of what had been , and what he hoped was yet to be -- rose up before him , in the old , dull , silent church !
Parsing [sent. 10251 len. 13]: He never told them what he thought , or where he went .
Parsing [sent. 10252 len. 46]: He would sit with them at night , pondering with a secret satisfaction , they could see , upon the flight that he and she would take before night came again ; and still they would hear him whisper in his prayers , ` Lord !
Parsing [sent. 10253 len. 6]: Let her come to-morrow ! '
Parsing [sent. 10254 len. 11]: The last time was on a genial day in spring .
Parsing [sent. 10255 len. 16]: He did not return at the usual hour , and they went to seek him .
Parsing [sent. 10256 len. 8]: He was lying dead upon the stone .
Parsing [sent. 10257 len. 44]: They laid him by the side of her whom he had loved so well ; and , in the church where they had often prayed , and mused , and lingered hand in hand , the child and the old man slept together .
Parsing [sent. 10258 len. 28]: Chapter 73 The magic reel , which , rolling on before , has led the chronicler thus far , now slackens in its pace , and stops .
Parsing [sent. 10259 len. 13]: It lies before the goal ; the pursuit is at an end .
Parsing [sent. 10260 len. 27]: It remains but to dismiss the leaders of the little crowd who have borne us company upon the road , and so to close the journey .
Parsing [sent. 10261 len. 19]: Foremost among them , smooth Sampson Brass and Sally , arm in arm , claim our polite attention .
Parsing [sent. 10262 len. 84]: Mr Sampson , then , being detained , as already has been shown , by the justice upon whom he called , and being so strongly pressed to protract his stay that he could by no means refuse , remained under his protection for a considerable time , during which the great attention of his entertainer kept him so extremely close , that he was quite lost to society , and never even went abroad for exercise saving into a small paved yard .
Parsing [sent. 10263 len. 87]: So well , indeed , was his modest and retiring temper understood by those with whom he had to deal , and so jealous were they of his absence , that they required a kind of friendly bond to be entered into by two substantial housekeepers , in the sum of fifteen hundred pounds a-piece , before they would suffer him to quit their hospitable roof -- doubting , it appeared , that he would return , if once let loose , on any other terms .
Parsing [sent. 10264 len. 57]: Mr Brass , struck with the humour of this jest , and carrying out its spirit to the utmost , sought from his wide connection a pair of friends whose joint possessions fell some halfpence short of fifteen pence , and proffered them as bail -- for that was the merry word agreed upon both sides .
Parsing [sent. 10265 len. 132]: These gentlemen being rejected after twenty-four hours ' pleasantry , Mr Brass consented to remain , and did remain , until a club of choice spirits called a Grand jury -LRB- who were in the joke -RRB- summoned him to a trial before twelve other wags for perjury and fraud , who in their turn found him guilty with a most facetious joy , -- nay , the very populace entered into the whim , and when Mr Brass was moving in a hackney-coach towards the building where these wags assembled , saluted him with rotten eggs and carcases of kittens , and feigned to wish to tear him into shreds , which greatly increased the comicality of the thing , and made him relish it the more , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 10266 len. 55]: To work this sportive vein still further , Mr Brass , by his counsel , moved in arrest of judgment that he had been led to criminate himself , by assurances of safety and promises of pardon , and claimed the leniency which the law extends to such confiding natures as are thus deluded .
Parsing [sent. 10267 len. 42]: After solemn argument , this point -LRB- with others of a technical nature , whose humorous extravagance it would be difficult to exaggerate -RRB- was referred to the judges for their decision , Sampson being meantime removed to his former quarters .
Parsing [sent. 10268 len. 51]: Finally , some of the points were given in Sampson 's favour , and some against him ; and the upshot was , that , instead of being desired to travel for a time in foreign parts , he was permitted to grace the mother country under certain insignificant restrictions .
Parsing [sent. 10269 len. 61]: These were , that he should , for a term of years , reside in a spacious mansion where several other gentlemen were lodged and boarded at the public charge , who went clad in a sober uniform of grey turned up with yellow , had their hair cut extremely short , and chiefly lived on gruel and light soup .
Parsing [sent. 10270 len. 53]: It was also required of him that he should partake of their exercise of constantly ascending an endless flight of stairs ; and , lest his legs , unused to such exertion , should be weakened by it , that he should wear upon one ankle an amulet or charm of iron .
Parsing [sent. 10271 len. 47]: These conditions being arranged , he was removed one evening to his new abode , and enjoyed , in common with nine other gentlemen , and two ladies , the privilege of being taken to his place of retirement in one of Royalty 's own carriages .
Parsing [sent. 10272 len. 71]: Over and above these trifling penalties , his name was erased and blotted out from the roll of attorneys ; which erasure has been always held in these latter times to be a great degradation and reproach , and to imply the commission of some amazing villany -- as indeed it would seem to be the case , when so many worthless names remain among its better records , unmolested .
Parsing [sent. 10273 len. 9]: Of Sally Brass , conflicting rumours went abroad .
Parsing [sent. 10274 len. 74]: Some said with confidence that she had gone down to the docks in male attire , and had become a female sailor ; others darkly whispered that she had enlisted as a private in the second regiment of Foot Guards , and had been seen in uniform , and on duty , to wit , leaning on her musket and looking out of a sentry-box in St james 's Park , one evening .
Parsing [sent. 10275 len. 98]: There were many such whispers as these in circulation ; but the truth appears to be that , after the lapse of some five years -LRB- during which there is no direct evidence of her having been seen at all -RRB- , two wretched people were more than once observed to crawl at dusk from the inmost recesses of St Giles 's , and to take their way along the streets , with shuffling steps and cowering shivering forms , looking into the roads and kennels as they went in search of refuse food or disregarded offal .
Parsing [sent. 10276 len. 59]: These forms were never beheld but in those nights of cold and gloom , when the terrible spectres , who lie at all other times in the obscene hiding-places of London , in archways , dark vaults and cellars , venture to creep into the streets ; the embodied spirits of Disease , and Vice , and Famine .
Parsing [sent. 10277 len. 51]: It was whispered by those who should have known , that these were Sampson and his sister Sally ; and to this day , it is said , they sometimes pass , on bad nights , in the same loathsome guise , close at the elbow of the shrinking passenger .
Parsing [sent. 10278 len. 31]: The body of Quilp being found -- though not until some days had elapsed -- an inquest was held on it near the spot where it had been washed ashore .
Parsing [sent. 10279 len. 32]: The general supposition was that he had committed suicide , and , this appearing to be favoured by all the circumstances of his death , the verdict was to that effect .
Parsing [sent. 10280 len. 20]: He was left to be buried with a stake through his heart in the centre of four lonely roads .
Parsing [sent. 10281 len. 28]: It was rumoured afterwards that this horrible and barbarous ceremony had been dispensed with , and that the remains had been secretly given up to Tom Scott .
Parsing [sent. 10282 len. 31]: But even here , opinion was divided ; for some said Tom dug them up at midnight , and carried them to a place indicated to him by the widow .
Parsing [sent. 10283 len. 36]: It is probable that both these stories may have had their origin in the simple fact of Tom 's shedding tears upon the inquest -- which he certainly did , extraordinary as it may appear .
Parsing [sent. 10284 len. 49]: He manifested , besides , a strong desire to assault the jury ; and being restrained and conducted out of court , darkened its only window by standing on his head upon the sill , until he was dexterously tilted upon his feet again by a cautious beadle .
Parsing [sent. 10285 len. 32]: Being cast upon the world by his master 's death , he determined to go through it upon his head and hands , and accordingly began to tumble for his bread .
Parsing [sent. 10286 len. 58]: Finding , however , his English birth an insurmountable obstacle to his advancement in this pursuit -LRB- notwithstanding that his art was in high repute and favour -RRB- , he assumed the name of an Italian image lad , with whom he had become acquainted ; and afterwards tumbled with extraordinary success , and to overflowing audiences .
Parsing [sent. 10287 len. 30]: Little Mrs Quilp never quite forgave herself the one deceit that lay so heavy on her conscience , and never spoke or thought of it but with bitter tears .
Parsing [sent. 10288 len. 11]: Her husband had no relations , and she was rich .
Parsing [sent. 10289 len. 14]: He had made no will , or she would probably have been poor .
Parsing [sent. 10290 len. 21]: Having married the first time at her mother 's instigation , she consulted in her second choice nobody but herself .
Parsing [sent. 10291 len. 53]: It fell upon a smart young fellow enough ; and as he made it a preliminary condition that Mrs Jiniwin should be thenceforth an out-pensioner , they lived together after marriage with no more than the average amount of quarrelling , and led a merry life upon the dead dwarf 's money .
Parsing [sent. 10292 len. 64]: Mr and Mrs Garland , and Mr Abel , went out as usual -LRB- except that there was a change in their household , as will be seen presently -RRB- , and in due time the latter went into partnership with his friend the notary , on which occasion there was a dinner , and a ball , and great extent of dissipation .
Parsing [sent. 10293 len. 28]: Unto this ball there happened to be invited the most bashful young lady that was ever seen , with whom Mr Abel happened to fall in love .
Parsing [sent. 10294 len. 26]: HOW it happened , or how they found it out , or which of them first communicated the discovery to the other , nobody knows .
Parsing [sent. 10295 len. 40]: But certain it is that in course of time they were married ; and equally certain it is that they were the happiest of the happy ; and no less certain it is that they deserved to be so .
Parsing [sent. 10296 len. 41]: And it is pleasant to write down that they reared a family ; because any propagation of goodness and benevolence is no small addition to the aristocracy of nature , and no small subject of rejoicing for mankind at large .
Parsing [sent. 10297 len. 43]: The pony preserved his character for independence and principle down to the last moment of his life ; which was an unusually long one , and caused him to be looked upon , indeed , as the very Old Parr of ponies .
Parsing [sent. 10298 len. 54]: He often went to and fro with the little phaeton between Mr Garland 's and his son 's , and , as the old people and the young were frequently together , had a stable of his own at the new establishment , into which he would walk of himself with surprising dignity .
Parsing [sent. 10299 len. 102]: He condescended to play with the children , as they grew old enough to cultivate his friendship , and would run up and down the little paddock with them like a dog ; but though he relaxed so far , and allowed them such small freedoms as caresses , or even to look at his shoes or hang on by his tail , he never permitted any one among them to mount his back or drive him ; thus showing that even their familiarity must have its limits , and that there were points between them far too serious for trifling .
Parsing [sent. 10300 len. 51]: He was not unsusceptible of warm attachments in his later life , for when the good bachelor came to live with Mr Garland upon the clergyman 's decease , he conceived a great friendship for him , and amiably submitted to be driven by his hands without the least resistance .
Parsing [sent. 10301 len. 35]: He did no work for two or three years before he died , but lived in clover ; and his last act -LRB- like a choleric old gentleman -RRB- was to kick his doctor .
Parsing [sent. 10302 len. 49]: Mr Swiveller , recovering very slowly from his illness , and entering into the receipt of his annuity , bought for the Marchioness a handsome stock of clothes , and put her to school forthwith , in redemption of the vow he had made upon his fevered bed .
Parsing [sent. 10303 len. 36]: After casting about for some time for a name which should be worthy of her , he decided in favour of Sophronia Sphynx , as being euphonious and genteel , and furthermore indicative of mystery .
Parsing [sent. 10304 len. 43]: Under this title the Marchioness repaired , in tears , to the school of his selection , from which , as she soon distanced all competitors , she was removed before the lapse of many quarters to one of a higher grade .
Parsing [sent. 10305 len. 86]: It is but bare justice to Mr Swiveller to say , that , although the expenses of her education kept him in straitened circumstances for half a dozen years , he never slackened in his zeal , and always held himself sufficiently repaid by the accounts he heard -LRB- with great gravity -RRB- of her advancement , on his monthly visits to the governess , who looked upon him as a literary gentleman of eccentric habits , and of a most prodigious talent in quotation .
Parsing [sent. 10306 len. 47]: In a word , Mr Swiveller kept the Marchioness at this establishment until she was , at a moderate guess , full nineteen years of age -- good-looking , clever , and good-humoured ; when he began to consider seriously what was to be done next .
Parsing [sent. 10307 len. 35]: On one of his periodical visits , while he was revolving this question in his mind , the Marchioness came down to him , alone , looking more smiling and more fresh than ever .
Parsing [sent. 10308 len. 27]: Then , it occurred to him , but not for the first time , that if she would marry him , how comfortable they might be !
Parsing [sent. 10309 len. 25]: So Richard asked her ; whatever she said , it was n't No ; and they were married in good earnest that day week .
Parsing [sent. 10310 len. 26]: Which gave Mr Swiveller frequent occasion to remark at divers subsequent periods that there had been a young lady saving up for him after all .
Parsing [sent. 10311 len. 44]: A little cottage at Hampstead being to let , which had in its garden a smoking-box , the envy of the civilised world , they agreed to become its tenants , and , when the honey-moon was over , entered upon its occupation .
Parsing [sent. 10312 len. 33]: To this retreat Mr Chuckster repaired regularly every Sunday to spend the day -- usually beginning with breakfast -- and here he was the great purveyor of general news and fashionable intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 10313 len. 72]: For some years he continued a deadly foe to Kit , protesting that he had a better opinion of him when he was supposed to have stolen the five-pound note , than when he was shown to be perfectly free of the crime ; inasmuch as his guilt would have had in it something daring and bold , whereas his innocence was but another proof of a sneaking and crafty disposition .
Parsing [sent. 10314 len. 44]: By slow degrees , however , he was reconciled to him in the end ; and even went so far as to honour him with his patronage , as one who had in some measure reformed , and was therefore to be forgiven .
Parsing [sent. 10315 len. 56]: But he never forgot or pardoned that circumstance of the shilling ; holding that if he had come back to get another he would have done well enough , but that his returning to work out the former gift was a stain upon his moral character which no penitence or contrition could ever wash away .
Parsing [sent. 10316 len. 47]: Mr Swiveller , having always been in some measure of a philosophic and reflective turn , grew immensely contemplative , at times , in the smoking-box , and was accustomed at such periods to debate in his own mind the mysterious question of Sophronia 's parentage .
Parsing [sent. 10317 len. 68]: Sophronia herself supposed she was an orphan ; but Mr Swiveller , putting various slight circumstances together , often thought Miss Brass must know better than that ; and , having heard from his wife of her strange interview with Quilp , entertained sundry misgivings whether that person , in his lifetime , might not also have been able to solve the riddle , had he chosen .
Parsing [sent. 10318 len. 59]: These speculations , however , gave him no uneasiness ; for Sophronia was ever a most cheerful , affectionate , and provident wife to him ; and Dick -LRB- excepting for an occasional outbreak with Mr Chuckster , which she had the good sense rather to encourage than oppose -RRB- was to her an attached and domesticated husband .
Parsing [sent. 10319 len. 11]: And they played many hundred thousand games of cribbage together .
Parsing [sent. 10320 len. 60]: And let it be added , to Dick 's honour , that , though we have called her Sophronia , he called her the Marchioness from first to last ; and that upon every anniversary of the day on which he found her in his sick room , Mr Chuckster came to dinner , and there was great glorification .
Parsing [sent. 10321 len. 65]: The gamblers , Isaac List and Jowl , with their trusty confederate Mr James Groves of unimpeachable memory , pursued their course with varying success , until the failure of a spirited enterprise in the way of their profession , dispersed them in various directions , and caused their career to receive a sudden check from the long and strong arm of the law .
Parsing [sent. 10322 len. 31]: This defeat had its origin in the untoward detection of a new associate -- young Frederick Trent -- who thus became the unconscious instrument of their punishment and his own .
Parsing [sent. 10323 len. 46]: For the young man himself , he rioted abroad for a brief term , living by his wits -- which means by the abuse of every faculty that worthily employed raises man above the beasts , and so degraded , sinks him far below them .
Parsing [sent. 10324 len. 48]: It was not long before his body was recognised by a stranger , who chanced to visit that hospital in Paris where the drowned are laid out to be owned ; despite the bruises and disfigurements which were said to have been occasioned by some previous scuffle .
Parsing [sent. 10325 len. 21]: But the stranger kept his own counsel until he returned home , and it was never claimed or cared for .
Parsing [sent. 10326 len. 35]: The younger brother , or the single gentleman , for that designation is more familiar , would have drawn the poor schoolmaster from his lone retreat , and made him his companion and friend .
Parsing [sent. 10327 len. 26]: But the humble village teacher was timid of venturing into the noisy world , and had become fond of his dwelling in the old churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 10328 len. 53]: Calmly happy in his school , and in the spot , and in the attachment of Her little mourner , he pursued his quiet course in peace ; and was , through the righteous gratitude of his friend -- let this brief mention suffice for that -- a POOR school-master no more .
Parsing [sent. 10329 len. 33]: That friend -- single gentleman , or younger brother , which you will -- had at his heart a heavy sorrow ; but it bred in him no misanthropy or monastic gloom .
Parsing [sent. 10330 len. 13]: He went forth into the world , a lover of his kind .
Parsing [sent. 10331 len. 60]: For a long , long time , it was his chief delight to travel in the steps of the old man and the child -LRB- so far as he could trace them from her last narrative -RRB- , to halt where they had halted , sympathise where they had suffered , and rejoice where they had been made glad .
Parsing [sent. 10332 len. 14]: Those who had been kind to them , did not escape his search .
Parsing [sent. 10333 len. 47]: The sisters at the school -- they who were her friends , because themselves so friendless -- Mrs Jarley of the wax-work , Codlin , Short -- he found them all ; and trust me , the man who fed the furnace fire was not forgotten .
