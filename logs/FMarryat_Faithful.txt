Parsing [sent. 1 len. 7]: Jacob Faithful , by Captain Marryat .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 15]: Captain Frederick Marryat was born July 10 1792 , and died August 8 1848 .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 16]: He retired from the British navy in 1828 in order to devote himself to writing .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 31]: In the following 20 years he wrote 26 books , many of which are among the very best of English literature , and some of which are still in print .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 14]: Marryat had an extraordinary gift for the invention of episodes in his stories .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 24]: He says somewhere that when he sat down for the day 's work , he never knew what he was going to write .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 7]: He certainly was a literary genius .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 19]: `` Jacob Faithful '' was published in 1834 , the fifth book to flow from Marryat 's pen .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 33]: The story tells the life and adventures of a boy who was born and brought up on a lighter -LRB- small river-barge -RRB- on the River Thames as it flows through London .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 24]: It gives an extremely interesting contemporary picture of life in London and on the river in the early part of the nineteenth century .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 21]: This e-text was transcribed in 1998 by Nick Hodson , and was reformatted in 2003 , and again in 2005 .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 8]: JACOB FAITHFUL , BY CAPTAIN FREDERICK MARRYAT .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 3]: CHAPTER ONE .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 54]: MY BIRTH , PARENTAGE , AND FAMILY PRETENSIONS -- UNFORTUNATELY I PROVE TO BE A DETRIMENTAL OR YOUNGER SON , WHICH IS REMEDIED BY A TRIFLING ACCIDENT -- I HARDLY RECEIVE THE FIRST ELEMENTS OF SCIENCE FROM MY FATHER , WHEN THE ELEMENTS CONSPIRE AGAINST ME , AND I AM LEFT AN ORPHAN .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 26]: Gentle reader , I was born upon the water -- not upon the salt and angry ocean , but upon the fresh and rapid-flowing river .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 30]: It was in a floating sort of box , called a lighter , and upon the river Thames , at low water , when I first smelt the mud .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 32]: This lighter was manned -LRB- an expression amounting to bullism , if not construed _ kind _ - ly -RRB- by my father , my mother , and your humble servant .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 29]: My father had the sole charge -- he was monarch of the deck : my mother , of course , was queen , and I was the heir-apparent .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 16]: Before I say one word about myself , allow me dutifully to describe my parents .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 11]: First , then , I will portray my queen mother .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 45]: Report says , that when she first came on board of the lighter , a lighter figure and a lighter step never pressed a plank ; but as far as I can tax my recollection , she was always a fat , unwieldy woman .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 10]: Locomotion was not to her taste -- gin was .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 33]: She seldom quitted the cabin -- never quitted the lighter : a pair of shoes may have lasted her for five years for the wear and tear she took out of them .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 37]: Being of this domestic habit , as all married women ought to be , she was always to be found when wanted ; but although always at hand , she was not always on her feet .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 25]: Towards the close of the day , she lay down upon her bed -- a wise precaution when a person can no longer stand .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 48]: The fact was , that my honoured mother , although her virtue was unimpeachable , was frequently seduced by liquor ; and although constant to my father , was debauched and to be found in bed with that insidious assailer of female uprightness -- _ gin _ .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 55]: The lighter , which might have been compared to another garden of Eden , of which my mother was the Eve , and my father the Adam to consort with , was entered by this serpent who tempted her ; and if she did not eat , she drank , which was even worse .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 48]: At first , indeed -- and I may mention it to prove how the enemy always gains admittance under a specious form -- she drank it only to keep the cold out of her stomach , which the humid atmosphere from the surrounding water appeared to warrant .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 41]: My father took his pipe for the same reason ; but , at the time that I was born , he smoked and she drank from morning to night , because habit had rendered it almost necessary to their existence .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 14]: The pipe was always to his lip , the glass incessantly to hers .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 36]: I would have defied any cold ever to have penetrated into their stomachs ; -- but I have said enough of my mother for the present ; I will now pass on to my father .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 27]: My father was a puffy , round-bellied , long-armed , little man , admirably calculated for his station in , or rather out of , society .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 17]: He could manage a lighter as well as anybody ; but he could do no more .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 11]: He had been brought up to it from his infancy .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 22]: He went on shore for my mother , and came on board again -- the only remarkable event in his life .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 35]: His whole amusement was his pipe ; and , as there is a certain indefinable link between smoking and philosophy , my father , by dint of smoking , had become a perfect philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 30]: It is no less strange than true , that we can puff away our cares with tobacco , when , without it , they remain a burden to existence .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 15]: There is no composing draught like the draught through the tube of a pipe .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 34]: The savage warriors of North America enjoyed the blessing before we did ; and to the pipe is to be ascribed the wisdom of their councils and the laconic delivery of their sentiments .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 11]: It would be well introduced into our own legislative assembly .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 23]: Ladies , indeed , would no longer peep down through the ventilator ; but we should have more sense and fewer words .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 39]: It is also to tobacco that is to be ascribed the stoical firmness of those American warriors , who , satisfied with the pipes in their mouths , submitted with perfect indifference to the torture of their enemies .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 25]: From the well-known virtues of this weed arose that peculiar expression when you irritate another , that you `` put his pipe out . ''
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 14]: My father 's pipe , literally and metaphorically , was never put out .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 34]: He had a few apophthegms which brought every disaster to a happy conclusion ; and as he seldom or never indulged in words , these sayings were deeply impressed upon my infant memory .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 21]: One was , '' _ It 's no use crying ; what 's done ca n't be helped _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 14]: When once these words escaped his lips , the subject was never renewed .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 69]: Nothing appeared to move him : the abjurations of those employed in the other lighters , barges , vessels , and boats of every description , who were contending with us for the extra foot of water , as we drifted up or down with the tide , affected him not , further than an extra column or two of smoke rising from the bowl of his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 37]: To my mother he used but one expression , '' _ Take it coolly _ ; '' but it always had the contrary effect with my mother , as it put her more in a passion .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 21]: It was like pouring oil upon flame ; nevertheless , the advice was good , had it ever been followed .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 37]: Another favourite expression of my father 's when anything went wrong , and which was of the same pattern as the rest of his philosophy , was , '' _ Better luck next time _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 58]: These aphorisms were deeply impressed upon my memory ; I continually recalled them to mind , and thus I became a philosopher long before my wise teeth were in embryo , or I had even shed the first set with which kind Nature presents us , that in the petticoat age we may fearlessly indulge in lollipop .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 8]: My father 's education had been neglected .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 45]: He could neither write nor read ; but although he did not exactly , like Cadmus , invent letters , he had accustomed himself to certain hieroglyphics , generally speaking sufficient for his purposes , and which might be considered as an artificial memory .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 37]: `` I ca n't write nor read , Jacob , '' he would say ; `` I wish I could ; but look , boy , I means this mark for three quarters of a bushel .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 22]: Mind you recollects it when I axes you , or I 'll be blowed if I do n't wallop you . ''
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 26]: But it was only a case of peculiar difficulty which would require a new hieroglyphic , or extract such a long speech from my father .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 48]: I was well acquainted with his usual scratches and dots , and having a good memory , could put him right when he was puzzled with some misshapen _ x _ or _ z _ , representing some unknown quantity , like the same letters in algebra .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 27]: I have said that I was heir-apparent , but I did not say that I was the only child born to my father in his wedlock .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 52]: My honoured mother had had two more children ; but the first , who was a girl , had been provided for by a fit of the measles ; and the second , my elder brother , by stumbling over the stern of the lighter when he was three years old .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 39]: At the time of the accident my mother had retired to her bed , a little the worse for liquor ; my father was on deck forward , leaning against the windlass , soberly smoking his evening pipe .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 6]: `` What was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 27]: exclaimed my father , taking his pipe out of his mouth , and listening ; `` I should n't wonder if that was n't Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 15]: And my father put in his pipe again , and smoked away as before .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 8]: My father was correct in his surmises .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 28]: It _ was _ Joe who had made the splash which roused him from his meditations , for the next morning Joe was nowhere to be found .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 69]: He was , however , found some days afterwards ; but , as the newspapers say , and as may well be imagined , the vital spark was extinct ; and , moreover , the eels and chubs had eaten off his nose and a portion of his chubby face , so that , as my father said , `` he was of no use to nobody . ''
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 18]: The morning after the accident my father was up early , and had missed poor little Joe .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 14]: He went into the cabin , smoked his pipe , and said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 37]: As my brother did not appear as usual for his breakfast , my mother called out for him in a harsh voice ; but Joe was out of hearing , and as mute as a fish .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 13]: Joe opened not his mouth in reply , neither did my father .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 36]: My mother then quitted the cabin , and walked round the lighter , looked into the dog-kennel to ascertain if he was asleep with the great mastiff -- but Joe was nowhere to be found .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 11]: `` Why , what can have become of Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 24]: cried my mother , with maternal alarm in her countenance , appealing to my father , as she hastened back to the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 43]: My father spoke not , but taking the pipe out of his mouth , dropped the bowl of it in a perpendicular direction till it landed softly on the deck , then put it into his mouth again , and puffed mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 14]: `` Why , you do n't mean to say he is overboard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 4]: screamed my mother .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 14]: My father nodded his head , and puffed away at an accumulated rate .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 15]: A torrent of tears , exclamations , and revilings succeeded to this characteristic announcement .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 9]: My father allowed my mother to exhaust herself .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 47]: By the time when she had finished , so was his pipe ; he then knocked out the ashes , and quietly observed , `` It 's no use crying ; what 's done ca n't be helped , '' and proceeded to refill the bowl .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 7]: `` Ca n't be helped ! ''
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 13]: cried my mother ; `` but it might have been helped . ''
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 10]: `` Take it coolly , '' replied my father .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 6]: `` Take it coolly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 12]: replied my mother in a rage -- `` take it coolly !
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 24]: Yes , you 're for taking everything coolly : I presume , if I fell overboard you would be taking it coolly . ''
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 18]: `` You would be taking it coolly , at all events , '' replied my imperturbable father .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 4]: `` O dear !
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 4]: O dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 16]: cried my poor mother ; `` two poor children , and lost them both ! ''
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 23]: `` Better luck next time , '' rejoined my father ; `` so , Sall , say no more about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 63]: My father continued for some time to smoke his pipe , and my mother to pipe her eye , until at last my father , who was really a kind-hearted man , rose from the chest upon which he was seated , went to the cupboard , poured out a teacupful of _ gin _ , and handed it to my mother .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 17]: It was kindly done of him , and my mother was to be won by kindness .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 20]: It was a pure offering in the spirit , and taken in the spirit in which it was offered .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 40]: After a few repetitions , which were rendered necessary from its potency being diluted with her tears , grief and recollection were drowned together , and disappeared like two lovers who sink down entwined in each other 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 17]: With this beautiful metaphor , I shall wind up the episode of my unfortunate brother Joe .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 46]: It was about a year after the loss of my brother that I was ushered into the world , without any other assistants or spectators than my father and Dame Nature , who I believe to be a very clever midwife if not interfered with .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 52]: My father , who had some faint ideas of Christianity , performed the baptismal rites by crossing me on the forehead with the end of his pipe , and calling me Jacob : as for my mother being churched , she had never been but once to church in her life .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 49]: In fact , my father and mother never quitted the lighter , unless when the former was called out by the superintendent or proprietor , at the delivery or shipment of a cargo , or was once a month for a few minutes on shore to purchase necessaries .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 47]: I can not recall much of my infancy ; but I recollect that the lighter was often very brilliant with blue and red paint , and that my mother used to point it out to me as `` so pretty , '' to keep me quiet .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 30]: I shall therefore pass it over , and commence at the age of five years , at which early period I was of some little use to my father .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 12]: Indeed I was almost as forward as some boys at ten .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 19]: This may appear strange ; but the fact is , that my ideas although bounded , were concentrated .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 41]: The lighter , its equipments , and its destination were the microcosm of my infant imagination ; and my ideas and thoughts being directed to so few objects , these objects were deeply impressed , and their value fully understood .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 27]: Up to the time that I quitted the lighter , at eleven years old , the banks of the river were the boundaries of my speculations .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 28]: I certainly comprehended something of the nature of trees and houses ; but I do not think that I was aware that the former _ grew _ .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 39]: From the time that I could recollect them on the banks of the river , they appeared to be exactly of the same size as they were when first I saw them , and I asked no questions .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 51]: But by the time that I was ten years old , I knew the name of the reach of the river , and every point -- the depth of water , and the shallows , the drift of the current , and the ebb and flow of the tide itself .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 31]: I was able to manage the lighter as it floated down with the tide ; for what I lacked in strength I made up with dexterity arising from constant practice .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 44]: It was at the age of eleven years that a catastrophe took place which changed my prospects in life , and I must , therefore , say a little more about my father and mother , bringing up their history to that period .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 31]: The propensity of my mother to ardent spirits had , as always is the case , greatly increased upon her , and her corpulence had increased in the same ratio .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 57]: She was now a most unwieldy , bloated mountain of flesh , such a form as I have never since beheld , although , at the time , she did not appear to me to be disgusting , accustomed to witness imperceptibly her increase , and not seeing any other females , except at a distance .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 40]: For the last two years she had seldom quitted her bed -- certainly she did not crawl out of the cabin more than five minutes during the week -- indeed , her obesity and habitual intoxication rendered her incapable .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 53]: My father went on shore for a quarter of an hour once a month , to purchase gin , tobacco , red herrings , and decayed ship-biscuits ; -- the latter was my principal fare , except when I could catch a fish over the sides , as we lay at anchor .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 45]: I was , therefore , a great water-drinker , not altogether from choice , but from the salt nature of my food , and because my mother had still sense enough left to discern that `` Gin was n't good for little boys . ''
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 11]: But a great change had taken place in my father .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 49]: I was now left almost altogether in charge of the deck , my father seldom coming up except to assist me in shooting the bridges , or when it required more than my exertions to steer clear of the crowds of vessels which we encountered when between them .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 35]: In fact , as I grew more capable , my father became more incapable , and passed most of his time in the cabin , assisting my mother in emptying the great stone bottle .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 24]: The woman had prevailed upon the man , and now both were guilty in partaking of the forbidden fruit of the Juniper Tree .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 22]: Such was the state of affairs in our little kingdom when the catastrophe occurred which I am now about to relate .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 58]: One fine summer 's evening we were floating up with the tide , deeply laden with coals , to be delivered at the proprietor 's wharf , some distance above Putney Bridge ; a strong breeze sprang up and checked our progress , and we could not , as we expected , gain the wharf that night .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 24]: We were about a mile and a half above the bridge when the tide turned against us , and we dropped our anchor .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 90]: My father who , expecting to arrive that evening , had very unwillingly remained sober , waiting until the lighter had swung to the stream , and then saying to me , `` Remember , Jacob , we must be at the wharf early tomorrow morning , so keep alive , '' went into the cabin to indulge in his potations , leaving me in possession of the deck , and also of my supper , which I never ate below , the little cabin being so unpleasantly close .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 72]: Indeed , I took all my meals _ al fresco _ , and , unless the nights were intensely cold , slept on deck , in the capacious dog-kennel abaft , which had once been tenanted by the large mastiff ; but he had been dead some years , was thrown overboard , and , in all probability , had been converted into savoury sausages at 1 shilling per pound weight .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 19]: Some time after his decease , I had taken possession of his apartment and had performed his duty .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 39]: I had finished my supper , which was washed down with a considerable portion of Thames water , for I always drank more when above the bridges , having an idea that it tasted more pure and fresh .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 46]: I had walked forward and looked at the cable to see if all was right , and then , having nothing more to do , I lay down on the deck , and indulged in the profound speculations of a boy of eleven years old .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 26]: I was watching the stars above me , which twinkled faintly , and appeared to me ever and anon to be extinguished and then relighted .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 40]: I was wondering what they could be made of , and how they came there , when of a sudden I was interrupted in my reveries by a loud shriek , and perceived a strong smell of something burning .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 41]: The shrieks were renewed again and again , and I had hardly time to get upon my legs when my father burst up from the cabin , rushed over the side of the lighter , and disappeared under the water .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 20]: I caught a glimpse of his features as he passed me , and observed fright and intoxication blended together .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 26]: I ran to the side where he had disappeared , but could see nothing but a few eddying circles as the tide rushed quickly past .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 51]: For a few seconds I remained staggered and stupefied at his sudden disappearance and evident death , but I was recalled to recollection by the smoke which encompassed me , and the shrieks of my mother , which were now fainter and fainter , and I hastened to her assistance .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 35]: A strong , empyreumatic , thick smoke ascended from the hatchway of the cabin , and , as it had now fallen calm , it mounted straight up the air in a dense column .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 31]: I attempted to go in , but so soon as I encountered the smoke I found that it was impossible ; it would have suffocated me in half a minute .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 24]: I did what most children would have done in such a situation of excitement and distress -- I sat down and cried bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 25]: In about ten minutes I moved my hands , with which I had covered up my face , and looked at the cabin hatch .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 10]: The smoke had disappeared , and all was silent .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 22]: I went to the hatchway , and although the smell was still overpowering , I found that I could bear it .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 15]: I descended the little ladder of three steps , and called `` Mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 6]: but there was no answer .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 30]: The lamp fixed against the after bulk-head , with a glass before it , was still alight , and I could see plainly to every corner of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 18]: Nothing was burning -- not even the curtains to my mother 's bed appeared to be singed .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 21]: I was astonished -- breathless with fear , with a trembling voice , I again called out `` Mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 28]: I remained more than a minute panting for breath , and then ventured to draw back the curtains of the bed -- my mother was not there !
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 15]: but there appeared to be a black mass in the centre of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 18]: I put my hand fearfully upon it -- it was a sort of unctuous , pitchy cinder .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 44]: I screamed with horror -- my little senses reeled -- I staggered from the cabin and fell down on the deck in a state amounting almost to insanity : it was followed by a sort of stupor , which lasted for many hours .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 54]: As the reader may be in some doubt as to the occasion of my mother 's death , I must inform him that she perished in that very peculiar and dreadful manner , which does sometimes , although rarely , occur , to those who indulge in an immoderate use of spirituous liquors .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 26]: Cases of this kind do , indeed , present themselves but once in a century , but the occurrence of them is too well authenticated .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 25]: She perished from what is termed _ spontaneous combustion _ , an inflammation of the gases generated from the spirits absorbed into the system .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 54]: It is to be presumed that the flames issuing from my mother 's body completely frightened out of his senses my father , who had been drinking freely ; and thus did I lose both my parents , one by fire and the other by water , at one and the same time .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWO .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 45]: I FULFIL THE LAST INJUNCTIONS OF MY FATHER , AND I AM EMBARKED UPON A NEW ELEMENT -- FIRST BARGAIN IN MY LIFE VERY PROFITABLE -- FIRST PARTING WITH OLD FRIENDS VERY PAINFUL -- FIRST INTRODUCTION INTO CIVILISED LIFE VERY UNSATISFACTORY TO ALL PARTIES .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 16]: It was broad daylight when I awoke from my state of bodily and mental imbecility .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 30]: For some time I could not recall to my mind all that had happened : the weight which pressed upon my feelings told me that it was something dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 35]: At length , the cabin hatch , still open , caught my eye ; I recalled all the horrors of the preceding evening , and recollected that I was left alone in the lighter .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 12]: I got up and stood on my feet in mute despair .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 28]: I looked around me -- the mist of the morning was hanging over the river , and the objects on shore were with difficulty to be distinguished .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 24]: I was chilled from lying all night in the heavy dew , and , perhaps , still more from previous and extraordinary excitement .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 11]: Venture to go down into the cabin I dare not .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 43]: I had an indescribable awe , a degree of horror at what I had seen , that made it impossible ; still I was unsatisfied , and would have given worlds , if I had had them , to explain the mystery .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 43]: I turned my eyes from the cabin hatch to the water , thought of my father , and then , for more than half an hour , watched the tide as it ran up -- my mind in a state of vacancy .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 75]: As the sun rose , the mist gradually cleared away ; trees , houses , and green fields , other barges coming up with the tide , boats passing and repassing , the barking of dogs , the smoke issuing from the various chimneys , all broke upon me by degrees ; and I was recalled to the sense that I was in a busy world , and had my own task to perform .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 37]: The last words of my father -- and his injunctions had ever been a law to me -- were , `` Mind , Jacob , we must be up at the wharf early to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 6]: I prepared to obey him .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 49]: Purchase the anchor I could not ; I therefore slipped the cable , lashing a broken sweep to the end of it , as a buoy-rope , and once more the lighter was at the mercy of the stream , guided by a boy of eleven years old .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 53]: In about two hours I was within a hundred yards of the wharf , and well in-shore , I hailed for assistance , and two men , who were on board of the lighters moored at the wharf , pushed off in a skiff to know what it was that I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 23]: I told them that I was alone in the lighter , without anchor or cable , and requested them to secure her .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 19]: They came on board , and in a few minutes the lighter was safe alongside of the others .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 43]: As soon as the lashings were passed , they interrogated me as to what had happened , but although the fulfilling of my father 's last injunctions had borne up my spirits , now that they were obeyed a reaction took place .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 28]: I could not answer them ; I threw myself down on the deck in a paroxysm of grief , and cried as if my heart would break .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 33]: The men , who were astonished , not only at my conduct but at finding me alone in the lighter , went on shore to the clerk , and stated the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 30]: He returned with them , and would have interrogated me , but my paroxysm was not yet over , and my replies , broken my sobs , were unintelligible .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 20]: The clerk and the two men went down into the cabin , returned hastily , and quitted the lighter .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 40]: In about a quarter of an hour I was sent for , and conducted to the house of the proprietor -- the first time in my life that I had ever put my foot on _ terra firma _ .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 28]: I was led into the parlour , where I found the proprietor at breakfast with his wife and his daughter , a little girl nine years old .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 32]: By this time I had recovered myself , and on being interrogated , told my story clearly and succinctly , while the big tears coursed each other down my dirty face .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 8]: `` How strange and how horrible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 17]: said the lady to her husband ; `` I can not understand it even now . ''
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 20]: `` Nor can I ; but still it is true , from what Johnson the clerk has witnessed . ''
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 27]: In the meantime my eyes were directed to every part of the room , which appeared to my ignorance as a Golcondo of wealth and luxury .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 22]: There were few things which I had seen before , but I had an innate idea that they were of value .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 62]: The silver tea-pot , the hissing urn , the spoons , the pictures in their frames , every article of furniture caught my wondering eye , and for a short time I had forgotten my father and my mother ; but I was recalled from my musing speculations by the proprietor inquiring how far I had brought the lighter without assistance .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 11]: `` Have you any friends , my poor boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 4]: inquired the lady .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 5]: no relations onshore ? ''
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 12]: `` I never was on shore before in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 12]: `` Do you know that you are a destitute orphan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 15]: `` That you have no father or mother , '' said the little girl .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 35]: `` Well , '' replied I , in my father 's words , having no answer more appropriate , `` it 's no use crying ; what 's done ca n't be helped . ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 11]: `` But what do you intend to do now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 13]: inquired the proprietor , looking hard at me after my previous answer .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 9]: `` Do n't know , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 11]: Take , it coolly , '' replied I , whimpering .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 8]: `` What a very odd child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 4]: observed the lady .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 12]: `` Is he aware of the extent of his misfortune ? ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 22]: `` Better luck next time , missus , '' repled I , wiping my eyes with the back of my hand .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 22]: `` What strange answers from a child who has shown so much feeling , '' observed the proprietor to his wife .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 7]: `` What is your name . ''
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 5]: `` Jacob Faithful . ''
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 8]: `` Can you write or read ? ''
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 27]: `` No , '' replied I , again using my father 's words : `` No , I ca n't -- I wish I could . ''
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 22]: `` Very well , my poor boy , we 'll see what 's to be done , '' said the proprietor .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 36]: `` I know what 's to be done , '' rejoined I ; `` you must send a couple of hands to get the anchor and cable , afore they cut the buoy adrift . ''
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 40]: `` You are right , my lad , that must be done immediately , '' said the proprietor ; `` but now you had better go down with Sarah into the kitchen ; cook will take care of you .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 12]: Sarah , my love , take him down to cook . ''
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 9]: The little girl beckoned me to follow her .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 50]: I was astonished at the length and variety of the _ companion-ladders _ , for such I considered the stairs , and was at last landed below , when little Sarah , giving cook the injunction to take care of me , again tripped lightly up to her mother .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 53]: I found the signification of `` take care of any one '' very different on shore from what it was on the river , where taking care of you means getting out of your way , and giving you a wide berth ; and I found the shore reading much more agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 31]: Cook did take care of me ; she was a kind-hearted , fat woman who melted at a tale of woe , although the fire made no impression on her .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 22]: I not only beheld , but I devoured , such things as never before entered into my mouth or my imagination .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 8]: Grief had not taken away my appetite .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 17]: I stopped occasionally to cry a little , wiped my eyes , and sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 38]: It was more than two hours before I laid down my knife , and not until strong symptoms of suffocation played round the regions of my trachea did I cry out , `` Hold , enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 20]: Somebody has made an epigram about the vast ideas which a miser 's horse must have had of corn .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 24]: I doubt , if such ideas were existent , whether they were at all equal to my astonishment at a leg of mutton .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 20]: I never had seen such a piece of meat before , and wondered if it were fresh or otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 35]: After such reflection I naturally felt inclined to sleep ; in a few minutes I was snoring upon two chairs , cook having covered me up with her apron to keep away the flies .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 36]: Thus was I fairly embarked upon a new element to me -- my mother earth ; and it may be just as well to examine now into the capital I possessed for my novel enterprise .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 15]: In person I was well-looking ; I was well-made , strong , and active .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 60]: Of my habiliments the less said the better ; I had a pair of trousers with no seat to them ; but this defect , when I stood up , was hid by my jacket , composed of an old waistcoat of my father 's , which reached down as low as the morning frocks worn in those days .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 37]: A shirt of coarse duck , and a fur cap , which was as rough and ragged as if it had been the hide of a cat pulled to pieces by dogs , completed my attire .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 19]: Shoes and stockings I had none ; these supernumerary appendages had never confined the action of my feet .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 76]: My mental acquisitions were not much more valuable ; they consisted of a tolerable knowledge of the depth of water , names of points and reaches in the River Thames , all of which was not very available on dry land -- of a few hieroglyphics of my father 's , which , as the crier says sometimes , winding up his oration , were of `` no use to nobody but the owner . ''
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 31]: Add to the above the three favourite maxims of my taciturn father , which were indelibly imprinted upon my memory , and you have the whole inventory of my stock-in-trade .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 41]: These three maxims were , I may say , incorporated into my very system , so continually had they been quoted to me during my life ; and before I went to sleep that night they were again conned over .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 97]: `` What 's done ca n't be helped , '' consoled me for the mishaps of my life ; `` Better luck next time , '' made me look forward with hope and , `` Take it coolly , '' was a subject of great reflection , until I feel into a deep sleep ; for I had sufficient penetration to observe that my father had lost his life by not adhering to his own principles ; and this perception only rendered my belief in the infallibility of these maxims to be even still more steadfast .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 27]: I have stated what was my father 's legacy , and the reader will suppose that from the maternal side the acquisition was _ nil _ .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 33]: Directly such was the case , but indirectly she proved a very good mother to me , and that was by the very extraordinary way in which she had quitted the world .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 15]: Had she met with a common death , she would have been worth nothing .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 26]: Burke himself would not have been able to dispose of her ; but dying as she did , her ashes were the source of wealth .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 31]: The bed , with her remains lying in the centre , even the curtains of the bed , were all brought on shore , and locked up in an outhouse .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 66]: The coroner came down in a post-chaise and four , charged to the country ; the jury was empanelled , my evidence was taken , surgeons and apothecaries attended from far and near to give their opinions , and after much examination , much arguing , and much disagreement , the verdict was brought in that she died through `` the visitation of God . ''
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 32]: As this , in other phraseology , implies that `` God only knows how she died , '' it was agreed to _ nemine contradicente _ , and gave universal satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 29]: But the extraordinary circumstance was spread everywhere , with all due amplifications , and thousands flocked to the wharfinger 's yard to witness the effects of spontaneous combustion .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 17]: The proprietor immediately perceived that he could avail himself of the public curiosity to my advantage .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 79]: A plate , with some silver and gold , was placed at the foot of my poor mother 's flock mattress , with , `` For the benefit of the orphan , '' in capital text , placarded above it ; and many were the shillings , half-crowns , and even larger sums which were dropped into it by the spectators , who shuddered as they turned away from this awful specimen of the effects of habitual intoxication .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 56]: For many days did the exhibition continue , during which time I was domiciled with the cook , who employed me in scouring her saucepans , and any other employment in which my slender services might be useful , little thinking at the time that my poor mother was holding her levee for my advantage .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 30]: On the eleventh day the exhibition was closed , and I was summoned upstairs by the proprietor , whom I found in company with a little gentleman in black .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 25]: This was a surgeon who had offered a sum of money for my mother 's remains , bed and curtains , in a lot .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 41]: The proprietor was willing to get rid of them in so advantageous a manner , but did not conceive that he was justified in taking this step , although for my benefit , without first consulting me , as heir-at-law .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 30]: `` Jacob , '' said he , `` this gentleman offers 20 pounds , which is a great deal of money , for the ashes of your poor mother .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 11]: Have you any objection to let him have them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 9]: `` What do you want 'em for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 20]: inquired I. `` I wish to keep them , and take great care of them , '' answered he .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 36]: `` Well , '' replied I , after a little consideration , `` if you 'll take care of the old woman , you may have her , '' -- and the bargain was concluded .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 20]: Singular that the first bargain I ever made in my life should be that of selling my own mother .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 35]: The proceeds of the exhibition and sale amounted to 47 pounds odd , which the worthy proprietor of the lighter , after deducting for a suit of clothes , laid up for my use .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 23]: Thus ends the history of my mother 's remains , which proved more valuable to me than ever she did when living .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 54]: In her career she somewhat reversed the case of Semele , who was first visited in a shower of gold , and eventually perished in the fiery embraces of the god : whereas my poor mother perished first by the same element , and the shower of gold descended to her only son .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 6]: But this is easily explained .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 17]: Semele was very lovely and did not drink gin -- my mother was her complete antithesis .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 66]: When I was summoned to my master 's presence to arrange the contract with the surgeon , I had taken off the waistcoat which I wore as a garment over all , that I might be more at my ease in chopping some wood for the cook , and the servant led me up at once , without giving me time to put it on .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 65]: After I had given my consent , I turned away to go downstairs again , when having , as I before observed , no seat to my trousers , the solution of continuity was observed by a little spaniel , who jumped from the sofa , and arriving at a certain distance , stood at bay , and barked most furiously at the exposure .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 16]: He had been bred among respectable people , and had never seen such an expose .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 35]: Mr Drummond , the proprietor , observed the defect pointed out by the dog , and forthwith I was ordered to be suited with a new suit -- certainly not before they were required .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 36]: In twenty-four hours I was thrust into a new garment by a bandy-legged tailor , assisted by my friend the cook , and turn or twist whichever way I pleased , decency was never violated .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 29]: A new suit of clothes is generally an object of ambition , and flatters the vanity of young and old ; but with me it was far otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 16]: Encumbered with my novel apparel , I experienced at once feelings of restraint and sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 77]: My shoes hurt me , my worsted stockings irritated the skin , and as I had been accustomed to hereditarily succeed to my father 's cast-off skins , which were a world too wide for my shanks , having but few ideas , it appeared to me as if I had swelled out to the size of the clothes which I had been accustomed to wear , not that they had been reduced to my dimensions .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 15]: I fancied myself a man , but was very much embarrassed with my manhood .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 16]: Every step that I took I felt as if I was checked back by strings .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 23]: I could not swing my arms as I was wont to do , and tottered in my shoes like a rickety child .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 44]: My old apparel had been consigned to the dust-hole by cook , and often during the day would I pass , casting a longing eye at it , wishing that I dare recover it , and exchange it for that which I wore .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 39]: I knew the value of it , and , like the magician in Aladdin 's tale , would have offered new lamps for old ones , cheerfully submitting to ridicule , that I might have repossessed my treasure .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 28]: With the kitchen and its apparatus I was now quite at home : but at every other part of the house and furniture I was completely puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 30]: Everything appeared to me foreign , strange , and unnatural , and Prince Le Boo , or any other savage , never stared or wondered more than I did .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 16]: Of most things I knew not the use , of many not even the names .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 14]: I was literally a savage , but still a kind and docile one .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 18]: The day after my new clothes had been put on , I was summoned into the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 48]: Mr Drummond and his wife surveyed me in my altered habiliments , and amused themselves at my awkwardness , at the same time that they admired my well-knit , compact , and straight figure , set off by a fit , in my opinion much too straight .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 19]: Their little daughter Sarah , who often spoke to me , went up and whispered to her mother .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 11]: `` You must ask papa , '' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 18]: Another whisper , and a kiss , and Mr Drummond told me I should dine with them .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 34]: In a few minutes I followed them into the dining-room and for the first time I was seated to a repast which could boast of some of the supernumerary comforts of civilised life .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 40]: There I sat , perched on a chair with my feet swinging close to the carpet , glowing with heat from the compression of my clothes and the novelty of my situation , and all that was around me .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 36]: Mr Drummond helped me to some scalding soup , a silver spoon was put into my hand , which I twisted round and round , looking at my face reflected in miniature on its polish .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 28]: `` Now , Jacob , you must eat the soup with the spoon , '' said little Sarah , laughing ; `` we shall all be done .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 4]: Be quick . ''
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 24]: `` Take it coolly , '' replied I , digging my spoon into the burning preparation , and tossing it into my mouth .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 19]: It burst forth from my tortured throat in a diverging shower , accompanied with a howl of pain .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 21]: `` The poor boy has scalded his mouth , '' cried the lady , pouring out a tumbler of water .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 27]: `` It 's no use crying , '' replied I , blubbering with all my might ; `` what 's done ca n't be helped . ''
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 28]: `` Better that you had not been helped , '' observed Mr Drummond , wiping off his share of my liberal spargification from his coat and waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 16]: `` The poor boy has been shamefully neglected , '' observed the good-natured Mrs Drummond .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 20]: `` Come , Jacob , sit down and try it again ; it will not burn you now . ''
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 34]: `` Better luck next time , '' said I , shoving in a portion of it , with a great deal of tremulous hesitation , and spilling one-half of it in its transit .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 25]: It was now cool , but I did not get on very fast ; I held my spoon awry , and soiled my clothes .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 43]: Mrs Drummond interfered , and kindly showed me how to proceed ; when Mr Drummond said , `` Let the boy eat it after his own fashion , my dear -- only be quick , Jacob , for we are waiting . ''
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 35]: `` Then I see no good losing so much of it , taking it in tale , '' observed I , `` when I can ship it all in bulk in a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 33]: I laid down my spoon , and stooping my head , applied my mouth to the edge of the plate , and sucked the remainder down my throat without spilling a drop .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 29]: I looked up for approbation , and was very much astonished to hear Mrs Drummond quietly observe , `` That is not the way to eat soup . ''
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 53]: I made so many blunders during the meal that little Sarah was in a continued roar of laughter ; and I felt so miserable , that I heartily wished myself again in my dog-kennel on board of the lighter , gnawing biscuit in all the happiness of content and dignity of simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 11]: For the first time I felt the pangs of humiliation .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 6]: Ignorance is not always debasing .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 19]: On board of the lighter , I was sufficient for myself , my company , and my duties .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 32]: I felt an elasticity of mind , a respect for myself , and a consciousness of power , as the immense mass was guided through the waters by my single arm .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 77]: There , without being able to analyse my feelings , I was a spirit guiding a little world ; and now , at this table , and in company with rational and well-informed beings , I felt humiliated and degraded ; my heart was overflowing with shame , and at one unusual loud laugh of the little Sarah , the heaped up measure of my anguish overflowed , and I burst into a passion of tears .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 104]: As I lay with my head upon the table-cloth , regardless of those decencies I had so much feared , and awake only to a deep sense of wounded pride , each sob coming from the very core of my heart , I felt a soft breathing warm upon my cheek , that caused me to look up timidly , and I beheld the glowing and beautiful face of little Sarah , her eyes filled with tears , looking so softly and beseechingly at me , that I felt at once I was of some value , and panted to be of more .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 23]: `` I wo n't laugh at you any more , '' said she ; `` so do n't cry , Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 13]: `` No more I will , '' replied I , cheering up .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 11]: She remained standing by me , and I felt grateful .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 25]: `` The first time I get a piece of wood , '' whispered I , `` I 'll cut you out a barge . ''
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 15]: `` That boy has a heart , '' said Mr Drummond to his wife .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 9]: `` But will it swim , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 5]: inquired the little girl .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 17]: `` Yes , and if it 's _ lopsided _ , call me a lubber . ''
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 12]: `` What 's lopsided , and what 's a lubber ? ''
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 3]: replied Sarah .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 9]: `` Why , do n't you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 24]: cried I ; and I felt my confidence return when I found that in this little instance I knew more than she did .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 3]: CHAPTER THREE .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 57]: I AM SENT TO A CHARITY SCHOOL , WHERE THE BOYS DO NOT CONSIDER CHARITY AS A PART OF THEIR EDUCATION -- THE PECULIARITIES OF THE MASTER , AND THE MAGICAL EFFECT OF A BLOW OF THE NOSE -- A DISQUISITION UPON THE LETTER A , FROM WHICH I FIND ALL MY PREVIOUS LEARNING THROWN AWAY .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 28]: Before I quitted the room , Sarah and I were in deep converse at the window , and Mr and Mrs Drummond employed likewise at the table .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 40]: The result of the conversation between Sarah and me was the intimacy of children ; that of Mr and Mrs Drummond , that the sooner I was disposed of , the more it would be for my own advantage .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 115]: Having some interest with the governors of a charity school near Brentford , Mr Drummond lost no time in procuring me admission ; and before I had quite spoiled my new clothes , having worn them nearly three weeks , I was suited afresh in a formal attire -- a long coat of pepper and salt , yellow leather breeches tied at the knees , a worsted cap with a tuft on the top of it , stockings and shoes to match , and a large pewter plate upon my breast , marked with Number 63 , which , as I was the last entered boy , indicated the sum total of the school .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 46]: It was with regret that I left the abode of the Drummonds , who did not think it advisable to wait for the completion of the barge , much to the annoyance of Miss Drummond , and before we arrived met them all out walking .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 41]: I was put into the ranks , received a little good advice from my worthy patron , who then walked away one way , while we walked another , looking like a regiment of yellow-thighed field-fares straightened in human perpendiculars .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 39]: Behold , then , the last scion of the Faithfuls , peppered , salted , and plated , that all the world might know that he was a charity-boy , and that there was charity in this world .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 49]: But if heroes , kings , great and grave men , must yield to destiny , lighter-boys can not be expected to escape ; and I was doomed to receive an education , board , lodging , raiment , etcetera , free , gratis , and for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 114]: Every society has it chief ; and I was about to observe that every circle has it centre , which certainly would have been true enough , but the comparison is of no use to me , as our circle had two centres , or , to follow up the first idea , had two chiefs -- the chief schoolmaster and the chief domestic -- the chief masculine and the chief feminine -- the chief with the ferula , and the chief with the brimstone and treacle -- the master and the matron , each of whom had their appendages -- the one in the usher , the other in the assistant housemaid .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 73]: But of this quartette , the master was not only the most important , but the most worthy of description ; and as he will often appear in the pages of my narrative , long after my education was complete , I shall be very particular in my description of Dominie Dobiensis , as he delighted to be called , or Dreary Dobs , as his dutiful scholars delighted to call him .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 98]: As in our school it was necessary that we should be instructed in reading , writing , and ciphering , the governors had selected the Dominie as the most fitting person that had offered for the employment , because he had , in the first place , written a work that nobody could understand upon the Greek particles ; secondly , he had proved himself a great mathematician , having , it is said , squared the circle by algebraical false quantities , but would never show the operation for fear of losing the honour by treachery .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 34]: He had also discovered as many errors in the demonstrations of Euclid as ever did Joey Hume in army and navy estimates , and with as much benefit to the country at large .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 25]: He was a man who breathed certainly in the present age , but the half of his life was spent in antiquity or algebra .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 30]: Once carried away by a problem , or a Greek reminiscence , he passed away , as it were , from his present existence , and everything was unheeded .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 16]: His body remained , and breathed on his desk , but his soul was absent .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 28]: This peculiarity was well known to the boys , who used to say , `` Dominie is in his dreams , and talks in his sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 33]: Dominie Dobiensis left reading and writing to the usher , contrary to the regulations of the school , putting the boys , if possible , into mathematics , Latin , and Greek .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 22]: The usher was not over competent to teach the two first ; the boys not over willing to learn the latter .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 17]: The master was too clever , the usher too ignorant ; hence the scholars profited little .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 19]: The Dominie was grave and irascible , but he possessed a fund of drollery and the kindest heart .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 11]: His features could not laugh , but his trachea did .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 43]: The chuckle rose no higher than the rings of the wind-pipe , and then it was vigorously thrust back again by the impulse of gravity into the region of his heart , and gladdened it with hidden mirth in its dark centre .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 19]: The Dominie loved a pun ; whether it was let off in English , Greek , or Latin .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 25]: The last two were made by nobody but himself , and not being understood , were , of course , relished by himself alone .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 27]: But his love of a pun was a serious attachment : he loved it with a solemn affection -- with him it was no laughing matter .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 14]: In person Dominie Dobiensis was above six feet , all bone and sinews .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 31]: His face was long and his lineaments large ; but his predominant feature was his nose , which , large as were the others , bore them down into insignificance .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 18]: It was a prodigy -- a ridicule ; but he consoled himself -- Ovid was called Naso .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 15]: It was not an aquiline nose , nor was it an aquiline nose reversed .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 20]: It was not a nose snubbed at the extremity , gross , heavy , or carbuncled , or fluting .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 13]: In all its magnitude of proportions , it was an intellectual nose .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 11]: It was thin , horny , transparent , and sonorous .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 9]: Its snuffle was consequential and its sneeze oracular .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 20]: The very sight of it was impressive ; its sound , when blown in school hours , was ominous .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 43]: But the scholars loved the nose for the warning which it gave : like the rattle of the dreaded snake , which announces its presence , so did the nose indicate to the scholars that they were to be on their guard .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 38]: The Dominie would attend to this world and its duties for an hour or two , and then forget his scholars and his school-room , while he took a journey into the world of Greek or algebra .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 36]: Then , when he marked _ x _ , _ y _ , and _ z _ , in his calculations , the boys knew that he was safe , and their studies were neglected .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 34]: Reader , did you ever witness the magic effects of a drum in a small village , when the recruiting party , with many-coloured ribbons , rouse it up with a spirit-stirring tattoo ?
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 24]: Matrons leave their domestic cares , and run to the cottage door : peeping over their shoulders , the maidens admire and fear .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 117]: The shuffling clowns raise up their heads gradually , until they stand erect and proud ; the slouch in the back is taken out , their heavy walk is changed to a firm yet elastic tread , every muscle appears more braced , every nerve , by degrees , new strung ; the blood circulates rapidly : pulses quicken , hearts throb , eyes brighten , and as the martial sound pervades their rustic frames , the Cimons of the plough are converted , as if by magic , into incipient heroes for the field ; -- and all this is produced by beating the skin of the most gentle , most harmless animal of creation .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 15]: Not having at hand the simile synthetical , we have resorted to the antithetical .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 13]: The blowing of the Dominie 's nose produced the very contrary effects .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 60]: It was a signal that he had returned from his intellectual journal , and was once more in his school-room -- that the master had finished with his _ x _ , _ y _ , _ z _ 's , and it was time for scholars to mind their _ p _ 's and _ q _ 's .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 138]: At this note of warning , like the minute-roll among the troops , every one fell into his place ; half-munched apples were thrust into the first pocket -- popguns disappeared -- battles were left to be decided elsewhere -- books were opened , and eyes directed to them -- forms that were fidgeting and twisting in all directions , now took one regimental inclined position over the desk -- silence was restored , order resumed her reign , and Mr Knapps , the usher , who always availed himself of these interregnums , as well as the scholars , by deserting to the matron 's room , warned by the well-known sound , hastened to the desk of toil ; such were the astonishing effects of a blow from Dominie Dobiensis ' sonorous and peace-restoring nose .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 35]: `` Jacob Faithful , draw near , '' were the first words which struck upon my tympanum the next morning , when I had taken my seat at the further end of the school-room .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 66]: I rose and threaded my way through two lines of boys , who put out their legs to trip me up in my passage through their ranks ; and surmounting all difficulties , found myself within three feet of the master 's high desk , or pulpit , from which he looked down upon me like the Olympian Jupiter upon mortals , in ancient time .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 9]: `` Jacob Faithful , canst thou read ? ''
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 18]: `` No , I ca n't , '' replied I ; `` I wish I could . ''
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 13]: `` A well-disposed answer , Jacob ; thy wishes shall be gratified .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 6]: Knowest thou thine alphabet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 10]: `` I do n't know what that is . ''
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 7]: `` Then thou knowest it not .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 7]: Mr Knapps shall forthwith instruct thee .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 13]: Thou shall forthwith go to Mr Knapps , who inculcateth the rudiments .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 16]: _ Levior Puer _ , lighter-boy , thou hast a _ crafty _ look . ''
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 31]: And then I heard a noise in his throat that resembled the `` cluck , cluck '' when my poor mother poured the gin out of the great stone bottle .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 26]: `` My little navilculator , '' continued he , `` thou art a weed washed on shore , one of Father Thames ' cast-up wrecks .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 14]: ` _ Fluviorum rex Eridanus _ , ' -LSB- Chuck , cluck . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 13]: To thy studies ; be thyself -- that is , be Faithful .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 11]: Mr Knapps , let the Cadmean art proceed forthwith . ''
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 75]: So saying , Dominie Dobiensis thrust his large hand into his right coat pocket , in which he kept his snuff loose , and taking a large pinch -LRB- the major part of which , the stock being low , was composed of hair and cotton abrasions which had collected in the corners of his pocket -RRB- , he called up the first class , while Mr Knapps called me to my first lesson .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 46]: Mr Knapps was a thin , hectic-looking young man , apparently nineteen or twenty years of age , very small in all his proportions , red ferret eyes , and without the least sign of incipient manhood ; but he was very savage , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 28]: Not being permitted to pummel the boys when the Dominie was in the school-room , he played the tyrant most effectually when he was left commanding officer .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 20]: The noise and hubbub certainly warranted his interference -- the respect paid to him was positively _ nil _ .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 26]: His practice was to select the most glaring delinquent , and let fly his ruler at him , with immediate orders to bring it back .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 92]: These orders were complied with for more than one reason ; in the first place , was the offender hit , he was glad that another should have his turn ; in the second , Mr Knapps being a very bad shot -LRB- never having drove a Kamschatdale team of dogs -RRB- , he generally missed the one he aimed at , and hit some other , who , if he did not exactly deserve it at that moment , certainly did for previous , or would for subsequent , delinquencies .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 22]: In the latter case , the ruler was brought back to him because there was no injury inflicted , although intended .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 43]: However , be it as it may , the ruler was always returned to him ; and thus did Mr Knapps pelt the boys as if they were cocks on Shrove Tuesday , to the great risk of their heads and limbs .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 44]: I have little further to say of Mr Knapps , except that he wore a black shalloon loose coat ; on the left sleeve of which he wiped his pen , and upon the right , but too often , his ever-snivelling nose .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 8]: `` What is that , boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 44]: said Mr Knapps , pointing to the letter A. I looked attentively , and recognising , as I thought , one of my father 's hieroglyphics , replied , `` That 's half-a-bushel ; '' and I was certainly warranted in my supposition .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 3]: `` Half-a-bushel !
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 8]: You 're more than half a fool .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 9]: That 's the letter _ A _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 13]: `` No ; it 's half-a-bushel ; father told me so . ''
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 13]: `` Then your father was as big a fool as yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 17]: `` Father knew what half-a-bushel was , and so do I : that 's half-a-bushel . ''
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 19]: `` I tell you it 's the letter A , '' cried Mr Knapps , in a rage .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 11]: `` It 's half-a-bushel , '' replied I , doggedly .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 36]: I persisted in my assertion : and Mr Knapps , who dared not punish me while the Dominie was present , descended his throne of one step , and led me up to the master .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 45]: `` I can do nothing with this boy , sir , '' said he , red as fire ; `` he denies the first letter in the alphabet , and insists upon it that the letter A is not A , but half-a-bushel . ''
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 22]: `` Dost thou , in thine ignorance , pretend to teach when thou comest here to learn , Jacob Faithful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 13]: `` Father always told me that that thing there meant half-a-bushel . ''
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 58]: `` Thy father might , perhaps , have used that letter to signify the measure which thou speakest of , in the same way as I , in my mathematics , use divers letters for known and unknown quantities ; but thou must forget that which thy father taught thee , and commence _ de novo _ .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 5]: Dost thou understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 8]: `` No , I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 25]: `` Then , little Jacob , that represents the letter A , and whatever else Mr Knapps may tell thee , thou wilt believe .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 9]: Return , Jacob , and be docile . ''
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 54]: SLEIGHT-OF-HAND AT THE EXPENSE OF MY FEET -- FILLING A MAN 'S POCKETS AS GREAT AN OFFENCE AS PICKING THEM , AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY -- A TURN OUT , A TURN UP , AND A TURN IN -- EARLY IMPRESSIONS REMOVED , AND REDUNDANCY OF FEELING CORRECTED BY A SPELL OF THE RATTAN .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 46]: I did not quit Mr Knapps until I had run through the alphabet , and then returned to my place , that I might con it over at my leisure , puzzling myself with the strange complexity of forms of which the alphabet was composed .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 26]: I felt heated and annoyed by the constraint of my shoes , always an object of aversion from the time I had put them on .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 24]: I drew my foot out of one , then out of the other , and thought no more of them for some time .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 35]: In the meanwhile the boys next me had passed them on with their feet to the others , and thus were they shuffled along until they were right up to the master 's desk .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 63]: I missed them , and perceiving that there was mirth at my expense , I narrowly and quietly watched up and down till I perceived one of the head boys of the school , who sat nearest the Dominie , catch up one of my shoes , and the Dominie being then in an absent fit , drop it into his coat-pocket .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 49]: A short time afterwards he got up , went to Mr Knapps , put a question to him , and while it was being answered , he dropped the other into the pocket of the usher , and tittering to the other boys , returned to his seat .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 86]: I said nothing ; but when the hours of school were over , the Dominie looked at his watch , blew his nose , which made the whole of the boys pop up their heads , like the clansmen of Roderick Dhu , when summoned by his horn , folded up his large pocket-hankerchief slowly and reverently , as if it were a banner , put it into his pocket , and uttered in a solemn tone , '' _ Tempus est ludendi _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 23]: As this Latin phrase was used every day at the same hour , every boy in the school understood so much Latin .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 29]: A rush from all the desks ensured , and amidst shouting , yelling , and leaping every soul disappeared except myself , who remained fixed to my form .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 27]: The Dominie rose from his pulpit and descended , the usher did the same , and both approached me on their way to their respective apartments .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 24]: `` Jacob Faithful , why still porest thou over thy book -- didst thou not understand that the hours of recreation had arrived ?
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 13]: Why risest thou not upon thy feet like the others ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 8]: 'Cause I 've got no shoes . ''
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 10]: `` And where are thy shoes , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 36]: `` One 's in your pocket , '' replied I `` and t ` other 's in his ` n. '' Each party placed their hands behind , and felt the truth of the assertion .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 17]: `` Expound , Jacob , '' said the Dominie , `` who hath done this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 56]: `` The big boy with the red hair , and a face picked all over with holes like the strainers in master 's kitchen , '' replied I. `` Mr Knapps , it would be _ infra dig _ on my part , and also on yours , to suffer this disrespect to pass unnoticed .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 6]: Ring in the boys . ''
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 44]: The boys were rung in , and I was desired to point out the offender , which I immediately did , and who as stoutly denied the offence ; but he had abstracted my shoe-strings , and put them into his own shoes .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 8]: I recognised them and it was sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 33]: `` Barnaby Bracegirdle , '' said the Dominie , `` thou art convicted , not only of disrespect towards me and Mr Knapps , but further of the grievous sin of lying .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 9]: Simon Swapps , let him be hoisted . ''
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 25]: He was hoisted : his nether garments descended , and then the birch descend with all the vigour of the Dominie 's muscular arm .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 25]: Barnaby Bracegirdle showed every symptom of his disapproval of the measures taken ; but Simon Swapps held fast , and the Dominie flogged fast .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 22]: After a minute 's flagellation , Barnaby was let down , his yellow tights pulled up , and the boys dismissed .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 12]: Barnaby 's face was red , but the antipodes were redder .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 20]: The Dominie departed , leaving us together , -- he adjusting his inexpressibles , I putting in my shoe-strings .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 21]: By the time Barnaby had buttoned up and wiped his eyes , I had succeeded in standing in my shoes .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 7]: There we were _ tete-a-tete _ .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 55]: `` Now , then , '' said Barnaby , holding one fist to my face , while , with the other open hand he rubbed behind , `` come out in the play-ground , Mr _ Cinderella _ , and see if I wo n't drub you within an inch of your life . ''
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 23]: `` It 's no use crying , '' said I , soothingly : for I had not wished him to be flogged .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 9]: `` What 's done ca n't be helped .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 7]: Did it hurt you much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 8]: This intended consolation was taken for sarcasm .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 3]: Barnaby stormed .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 14]: `` Take it coolly , '' observed I. Barnaby waxed even more wroth .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 15]: `` Better luck next time , '' continued I , trying to soothe him .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 20]: Barnaby was outrageous -- he shook his fist and ran into the play-ground , daring me to follow him .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 43]: His threats had no weight with me ; not wishing to remain indoors , I followed him in a minute or two , when I found him surrounded by the other boys , to whom he was in loud and vehement harangue .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 10]: `` Cinderella , where 's your glass slippers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 10]: cried the boys , as I made my appearance .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 19]: `` Come out , you water-rat , '' cried Barnaby , `` you son of a cinder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 15]: `` Come out and fight him , or else you 're a coward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 14]: exclaimed the whole host , from Number 1 to Number 62 , inclusive .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 31]: `` He has had beating enough already to my mind , '' replied I ; `` but he had better not touch me -- I can use my arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 16]: A ring was formed , in the centre of which I found Barnaby and myself .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 12]: He took off his clothes , and I did the same .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 15]: He was much older and stronger than I , and knew something about fighting .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 8]: One boy came forward as my second .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 36]: Barnaby advanced and held out his hand , which I shook heartily , thinking it was all over : but immediately received a right and left on the face , which sent me reeling backwards .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 19]: This was a complete mystery , but it raised my bile , and I returned it with interest .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 42]: I was very strong in my arms , as may be supposed ; and I threw them about like sails of a windmill , never hitting straight out , but with semicircular blows , which descended on or about his ears .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 22]: On the contrary , his blows were all received straightforward , and my nose and face were soon covered with blood .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 23]: As I warmed with pain and rage I flung out my arms at random , and Barnaby gave me a knock-down blow .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 39]: I was picked up and sat upon my second 's knee , who whispered to me as I spat the blood out of my mouth , `` Take it coolly , and make sure when you hit . ''
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 30]: My own -- my father 's maxim -- coming from another , it struck with double force , and I never forgot it during the remainder of the fight .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 27]: Again we were standing up face to face ; again I received it right and left , and returned it upon his right and left ears .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 9]: Barnaby rushed in -- I was down again .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 19]: `` Better luck next time , '' said I to my second , as cool as a cucumber .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 20]: A third and a fourth round succeeded , all apparently in Barnaby 's favour , but really in mine .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 29]: My face was beat to a mummy , but he was what is termed groggy , from the constant return of blows on the side of the head .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 8]: Again we stood up panting and exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 32]: Barnaby rushed at me , and I avoided him : before he could return to the attack I had again planted two severe blows upon his ears , and he reeled .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 24]: He shook his head , and with his fists in the attitude of defence , asked me whether I had had enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 25]: _ He _ has , '' said my second ; `` stick to him now , Jacob , and you 'll beat him . ''
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 27]: I did stick to him ; three or four more blows applied to the same part finished him , and he fell senseless on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 11]: `` You 've settled him , '' cried my second .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 18]: `` What 's done ca n't be helped , '' replied I. `` Is he dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 7]: `` What 's all this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 16]: cried Mr Knapps , pressing his way through the crowd , followed by the matron .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 18]: `` Barnaby and Cinderella having it out , sir , '' said one of the elder boys .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 34]: The matron , who had already taken a liking for me , because I was good-looking , and because I had been recommended to her care by Mrs Drummond , ran to me .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 43]: `` Well , '' says she , `` if the Dominie do n't punish that big brute for this , I 'll see whether I 'm anybody or not ; '' and taking me by the hand , she led me away .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 29]: In the meantime Mr Knapps surveyed Barnaby , who was still senseless ; and desired the other boys to bring him in and lay him on his bed .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 25]: He breathed hard , but still remained senseless , and a surgeon was sent for , who found it necessary to bleed him copiously .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 26]: He then , at the request of the matron , came to me ; my features were indistinguishable , but elsewhere I was all right .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 8]: As I stripped he examined my arms .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 32]: `` It seemed strange , '' observed he , `` that the bigger boy should be so severely punished ; but this boy 's arms are like little _ sledge-hammers _ .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 32]: I recommend you , '' said he to the other boys , `` not to fight with him , for some day or other he 'll kill one of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 24]: This piece of advice was not forgotten by the other boys , and from that day I was the cock of the school .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 29]: The name of Cinderella , given me by Barnaby , in ridicule of my mother 's death , was immediately abandoned , and I suffered no more persecution .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 44]: It was the custom of the Dominie , whenever two boys fought , to flog them both ; but in this instance it was not followed up , because I was not the aggressor , and my adversary narrowly escaped with his life .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 24]: I was under the matron 's care for a week , and Barnaby under the surgeon 's hands for about the same time .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 9]: Neither was I less successful in my studies .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 54]: I learnt rapidly , after I had conquered the first rudiments ; but I had another difficulty to conquer , which was my habit of construing everything according to my refined ideas ; the force of association had become so strong that I could not overcome it for a considerable length of time .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 25]: Mr Knapps continually complained of my being obstinate , when , in fact , I was anxious to please as well as to learn .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 23]: For instance , in spelling , the first syllable always produced the association with something connected with my former way of life .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 25]: I recollect the Dominie once , and only once , gave me a caning , about a fortnight after I went to the school .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 11]: I had been brought up by Mr Knapps as contumelious .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 8]: `` Jacob Faithful , how is this ?
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 10]: thine head is good yet wilt thou refuse learning .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 12]: Tell me now , what does _ c-a-t _ spell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 14]: It was the pitch-pipe to _ cat-head _ , and answered I accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 21]: `` Nay , Jacob , it spells _ cat _ ; take care of thy head on the next reply .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 8]: Understand me , head is not understood .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 8]: Jacob , thy head is in jeopardy .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 13]: Now , Jacob , what does _ m-a-t _ spell ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 25]: _ Chafing-mat _ , '' replied I. `` It spells mat only , silly boy ; the chafing will be on my part directly .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 12]: Now , Jacob , what does _ d-o-g _ spell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 4]: `` Dog-kennel . ''
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 9]: `` Dog , Jacob , without the kennel .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 14]: Thou art very contumelious , and deservest to be rolled in the kennel .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 23]: Now , Jacob , this is the last time that thou triflest with me ; what does _ h-a-t _ spell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 12]: `` Fur cap , '' replied I , after some hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 40]: `` Jacob , I feel the wrath rising within me , yet would I fain spare thee ; if _ h-a-t _ spell fur-cap , pray advise me , what doth _ c-a-p _ spell , then ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 5]: _ Capstern _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 33]: `` Indeed , Jacob , thy stern as well as thy head are in danger ; and I suppose , then , _ w-i-n-d _ spells windlass , does it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 18]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied I , pleased to find that he agreed with me .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 15]: `` Upon the same principle , what does _ r-a-t _ spell ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 42]: _ Rat _ , sir , '' replied I. `` Nay , Jacob , _ r-a-t _ must spell _ rattan _ , and as thou hast missed thine own mode of spelling , thou shalt not miss the cane . ''
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 32]: The Dominie then applied it to my shoulders with considerable unction , much to the delight of Mr Knapps , who thought the punishment was much too small for the offence .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 27]: But I soon extricated myself from these associations as my ideas extended , and was considered by the Dominie as the cleverest boy in the school .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 39]: Whether it were from natural intellect , or from my brain having lain fallow , as it were , for so many years , or probably from the two causes combined , I certainly learned almost by instinct .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 18]: I read my lessons once over and laid my book aside , for I knew it all .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 35]: I had not been six months at the school before I discovered that , in a thousand instances , the affection of a father appeared towards me under the rough crust of the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 48]: I think it was on the third day of the seventh month that I afforded him a day of triumph and warming of his heart , when he took me for the first time into his little study , and put the Latin Accidence into my hands .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 57]: I learnt my first lesson in a quarter of an hour ; and I remember well how that unsmiling , grave man looked into my smiling eyes , parting the chestnut curls , which the matron would not cut off , from my brows , and saying , '' _ Bene fecisti , Jacobe _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 49]: Many times afterwards , when the lesson was over , he would fix his eyes upon me , fall back on his chair , and make me recount all I could remember of my former life , which was really nothing but a record of perceptions and feelings .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 77]: He _ could _ attend to _ me _ , and as I related some early and singular impression , some conjecture of what I saw , yet could not comprehend , on the shore which I had never touched , he would rub his hands with enthusiasm , and exclaim , `` I have found a new book -- an album , whereon I may write the deeds of heroes and the words of sages .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 5]: _ Carissime Jacobe _ !
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 12]: how happy shall we be when we get into Virgil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 24]: I hardly need say that I loved him -- I did so from my heart , and learned with avidity to please him .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 15]: I felt that I was of consequence -- my confidence in myself was unbounded .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 10]: I walked proudly , yet I was not vain .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 47]: My school-fellows hated me , but they feared me as much for my own prowess as my interest with the master ; but still many were the bitter gibes and innuendoes which I was obliged to hear as I sat down with them to our meals .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 19]: At other times I held communion with the Dominie , the worthy old matron , and my books .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 15]: We walked out every day , at first attended by Mr Knapps the usher .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 19]: The boys would not walk with me without they were ordered , and if ordered , most unwillingly .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 9]: Yet I had given no cause of offence .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 25]: The matron found it out , told the Dominie , and after that the Dominie attended the boys and led me by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 32]: This was of the greatest advantage to me , as he answered all my questions , which were not few , and each day I advanced in every variety of knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 26]: Before I had been eighteen months at school , the Dominie was unhappy without my company , and I was equally anxious for his presence .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 33]: He was a father to me , and I loved him as a son should love a father , and as it will hereafter prove , he was my guide through life .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 35]: But although the victory over Barnaby Bracegirdle , and the idea of my prowess procured me an enforced respect , still the Dominie 's goodwill towards me was the occasion of a settled hostility .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 55]: Affront me , or attack me openly , they dare not ; but supported as the boys were by Mr Knapps the usher , who was equally jealous of my favour , and equally mean in spirit , they caballed to ruin me , if possible , in the good opinion of my master .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 17]: Barnaby Bracegirdle had a talent for caricature , which was well-known to all but the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 35]: His first attempt against me was a caricature of my mother 's death , in which she was represented as a lamp supplied from a gin-bottle , and giving flame out of her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 13]: This was told to me , but I did not see it .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 21]: It was given by Barnaby to Mr Knapps , who highly commended it , and put it into his desk .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 29]: After which , Barnaby made an oft-repeated caricature of the Dominie , with a vast nose , which he shewed to the usher as _ my _ performance .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 17]: The usher understood what Barnaby was at , and put it into his desk without comment .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 49]: Several other ludicrous caricatures were made of the Dominie and of the matron , all of which were consigned to Mr Knapps by the boys as being the productions of my pencil ; but this was not sufficient -- it was necessary I should be more clearly identified .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 44]: It so happened that one evening , when sitting with the Dominie at my Latin , the matron and Mr Knapps being in the adjoining room , the light , which had burned close down , fell in the socket and went out .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 22]: The Dominie rose to get another ; the matron also got up to fetch away the candlestick with the same intent .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 14]: They met in the dark , and ran their heads together pretty hard .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 33]: As this event was only known to Mr Knapps and myself , he communicated it to Barnaby , wondering whether I should not make it a subject of one of my caricatures .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 20]: Barnaby took the hint ; in the course of a few hours this caricature was added to the others .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 30]: Mr Knapps , to further his views , took an opportunity to mention with encomium my talent for drawing , added that he had seen several of my performances .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 29]: `` The boy hath talent , '' replied the Dominie ; `` he is a rich mine , from which much precious metal is to be obtained . ''
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 25]: `` I hear that thou hast the talent for drawing , Jacob , '' said he to me , a day or two afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 33]: `` I never had in my life , sir , '' replied I. `` Nay , Jacob ; I like modesty but modesty should never lead to a denial of the truth .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 13]: Remember , Jacob , that thou do not repeat the fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 37]: I made no answer , as I felt convinced that I was not in fault ; but that evening I requested the Dominie to lend me a pencil , as I wished to try and draw .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 16]: For some days , various scraps of my performances were produced , and received commendation .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 23]: `` The boy draweth well , '' observed the Dominie to Mr Knapps , as he examined my performance through his spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 13]: `` Why should he have denied his being able to draw ? ''
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 4]: observed the usher .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 28]: `` It was a fault arising from modesty or want of confidence -- even a virtue , carried to excess , may lead us into error . ''
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 16]: The next attempt of Barnaby was to obtain the Cornelius Nepos which I then studied .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 79]: This was effected by Mr Knapps , who took it out of the Dominie 's study , and put it into Barnaby 's possession , who drew on the fly-leaf , on which was my name , a caricature head of the Dominie ; and under my own name , which I had written on the leaf , added , in my hand , _ fecit _ , so that it appeared , Jacob Faithful _ fecit _ .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 22]: Having done this , the leaf was torn out of the book , and consigned to the usher with the rest .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 12]: The plot was now ripe ; and the explosion soon ensued .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 13]: Mr Knapps told the Dominie that I drew caricatures of my school-fellows .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 10]: The Dominie taxed me , and I denied it .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 11]: `` So you denied drawing , '' observed the usher .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 33]: A few days passed away , when Mr Knapps informed the Dominie that I had been caricaturing him and Mrs Bately , the matron , and that he had proofs of it .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 24]: I had then gone to bed ; the Dominie was much surprised , and thought it impossible that I could be so ungrateful .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 42]: Mr Knapps said that should make the charge openly , and prove it the next morning in the school-room ; and wound up the wrong by describing me in several points , as a cunning , good-for-nothing , although clever boy .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 79]: MR. KNAPPS THINKS TO CATCH ME NAPPING , BUT THE PLOT IS DISCOVERED , AND BARNABY BRACEGIRDLE IS OBLIGED TO LOOSEN HIS BRACES FOR THE SECOND TIME ON MY ACCOUNT -- DRAWING CARICATURES ENDS IN DRAWING BLOOD -- THE USHER IS USHERED OUT OF THE SCHOOL , AND I AM NEARLY USHERED INTO THE NEXT WORLD , BUT INSTEAD OF BEING BOUND ON SO LONG A JOURNEY , I AM BOUND '' ` PRENTICE TO A WATERMAN . ''
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 28]: Ignorant of what had passed , I slept soundly ; and the next morning found the matron very grave with me , which I did not comprehend .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 29]: The Dominie also took no notice of my morning salute : but supposing him to be wrapt in Euclid at the time , I thought little of it .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 12]: The breakfast passed over , and the bell rang for school .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 44]: We were all assembled ; the Dominie walked in with a very magisterial air , followed by Mr Knapps , who , instead of parting company when he arrived at his own desk , continued his course with the Dominie to his pulpit .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 23]: We all knew that there was something in the wind ; but of all , perhaps , I was the least alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 23]: The Dominie unfolded his large handkerchief , waved it , and blew his nose , and the school was into profound silence .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 22]: `` Jacob Faithful , draw near , '' said he , in a tone which proved that the affair was serious .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 6]: I drew near , wondering .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 26]: `` Thou hast been accused by Mr Knapps of caricaturing , and holding up to the ridicule of the school , me -- thy master .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 46]: Upon any other boy such disrespect should be visited severely ; but from thee , Jacob , I must add in the words of Caesar , ` _ Et tu Brute _ , ' I expected , I had a right to expect , otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 11]: _ In se animi ingrati crimen vitia omnia condit _ .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 12]: Thou understandest me , Jacob -- guilty or not guilty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 12]: `` Not guilty , sir , '' replied I , firmly .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 19]: `` He pleadeth net guilty , Mr Knapps ; proceed , then , to prove thy charge . ''
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 27]: Mr Knapps then went to his desk , and brought out the drawings with which he had been supplied by Barnaby Bracegirdle and the other boys .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 28]: `` These drawings , sir , which you will please to look over , have all been given up to me as the performance of Jacob Faithful .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 29]: At first I could not believe it to be true ; but you will perceive , at once , that they are all by the same hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 18]: `` That I acknowledge , '' said the Dominie ; `` and all reflect upon my nose .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 50]: It is true that my nose is of large dimensions , but it was the will of Heaven that I should be so endowed ; yet are the noses of these figures even larger than mine own could warrant , if the limner were correct , and not malicious .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 40]: Still have they merit , '' continued the Dominie , looking at some of them ; and I heard a gentle _ cluck , cluck _ , in his throat , as he laughed at his own mis-representations . ''
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 14]: _ Artis adumbratae meruit cum sedula laudem _ , as Prudentius hath it .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 10]: I have no time to finish the quotation . ''
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 37]: `` Here is one drawing , sir , '' continued Mr Knapps , `` which proves to me that Jacob Faithful is the party ; in which you and Mrs Bately are shown up to ridicule .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 19]: Who would have been aware that the candle went out in your study , except Jacob Faithful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 33]: `` I perceive , '' replied the Dominie , looking at it through his spectacles , when put into his hand , `` the arcana of the study have been violated . ''
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 18]: `` But , sir , '' continued Mr Knapps , `` here is a more convincing proof .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 19]: You observe this caricature of yourself , with his own name put to it -- his own handwriting .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 22]: I recognised it immediately ; and happening to turn over his Cornelius Nepos , observed the first blank leaf torn out .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 26]: Here it is , sir , and you will observe that it fits on to the remainder of the leaf in the book exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 18]: `` I perceive that it doth ; and am grieved to find that such is the case .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 12]: Jacob Faithful , thou are convicted of disrespect and of falsehood .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 6]: Where is Simon Swapps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 14]: `` If you please , sir , may I not defend myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 11]: replied I. `` Am I to be flogged unheard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 21]: `` Nay , that were an injustice , '' replied the Dominie ; `` but what defence canst thou offer ?
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 9]: _ O puer infelix et sceleratus _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 11]: `` May I look at those caricatures , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 3]: said I .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 9]: The Dominie handed them to me in silence .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 17]: I looked them all over , and immediately knew them to be drawn by Barnaby Bracegirdle .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 6]: The last particularly struck me .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 24]: I had felt confounded and frightened with the strong evidence brought against me ; but this re-assured me , and I spoke boldly .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 15]: `` These drawings are by Barnaby Bracegirdle , sir , and not by me .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 10]: I never drew a caricature in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 25]: `` So didst thou assert that thou couldst not draw , and afterwards provedst by thy pencil to the contrary , Jacob Faithful . ''
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 44]: `` I knew not that I was able to draw when I said so ; but I wished to draw when you supposed I was able -- I did not like that you should give me credit for what I could not do .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 16]: It was to please you , sir , that I asked for the pencil . ''
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 24]: `` I wish it were as thou statest , Jacob -- I wish from my inmost soul that thou wert not guilty . ''
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 18]: `` Will you ask Mr Knapps from whom he had these drawings , and at what time ?
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 9]: There are a great many of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 14]: `` Answer , Mr Knapps , to the questions of Jacob Faithful . ''
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 19]: `` They have been given to me by the boys at different times during this last month . ''
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 15]: `` Well , Mr Knapps , point out the boys who gave them . ''
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 13]: Mr Knapps called out eight or ten boys , who came forward .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 14]: `` Did Barnaby Bracegirdle give you none of them , Mr Knapps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 10]: said I , perceiving that Barnaby was not summoned .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 8]: `` No , '' replied Mr Knapps .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 60]: `` If you please , sir , '' said I to the Dominie , `` with respect to the leaf out of my Nepos , the Jacob Faithful was written on it by me on the day that you gave it to me ; but the _ fecit _ , and the caricature of yourself , is not mine .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 10]: How it came there I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 13]: `` Thou hast disproved nothing , Jacob , '' replied the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 9]: `` But I have proved something , sir .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 16]: On what day was it that I asked you for the pencil to draw with ?
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 8]: Was it not on a Saturday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 11]: `` Last Saturday week , I think it was . ''
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 20]: `` Well , then , sir , Mr Knapps told you the day before that I could draw ? ''
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 10]: `` He did ; and thou deniedst it . ''
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 28]: `` How , then , does Mr Knapps account for not producing those caricatures of mine , which he says he has collected for a whole month ?
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 11]: Why did n't he give them to you before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 11]: `` Thou puttest it shrewdly , '' replied the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 25]: `` Answer , Mr Knapps , why didst thou , for a fortnight at the least , conceal thy knowledge of his offence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 13]: `` I wished to have more proofs , '' replied the usher .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 8]: `` Thou hearest , Jacob Faithful . ''
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 20]: `` Pray , sir , did you ever hear me speak of my poor mother but with kindness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 12]: `` Never , Jacob , thou hast ever appeared dutiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 12]: `` Please , sir , to call up John Williams . ''
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 10]: `` John , Number 37 , draw near . ''
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 26]: `` Williams , '' said I , `` did you not tell me that Barnaby Bracegirdle had drawn my mother flaming at the mouth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 7]: `` Yes , I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 11]: My indignation now found vent in a torrent of tears .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 37]: `` Now , sir , '' cried I , `` if you believe that I drew the caricatures of you and Mrs Bately -- did I draw this , which is by the same person ? ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 26]: And I handed up to the Dominie the caricature of my mother , which Mr Knapps had inadvertently produced at the bottom of the rest .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 8]: Mr Knapps turned white as a sheet .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 14]: The Dominie looked at the caricature , and was silent for some time .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 8]: At last he turned to the usher .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 12]: `` From whom didst thou obtain this , Mr Knapps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 13]: Mr Knapps replied in his confusion , `` From Barnaby Bracegirdle . ''
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 18]: `` It was but this moment thou didst state that thou hadst received none from Barnaby Bracegirdle .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 8]: Thou hast contradicted thyself , Mr Knapps .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 35]: Jacob did not draw his mother ; and the pencil is the same as that which drew the rest -- ergo , he did not , I really believe , draw one of them .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 6]: _ Ite procul fraudes _ .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 13]: God , I thank thee , that the innocent have been protected .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 18]: Narrowly hast thou escaped these toils , O Jacob -- _ Cum populo et duce fraudulento _ .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 5]: And now for punishment .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 17]: Barnaby Bracegirdle , thou gavest this caricature to Mr Knapps ; from whence hadst thou it ?
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 4]: Lie not . ''
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 16]: Barnaby turned red and white , and then acknowledged that the drawing was his own .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 34]: `` You boys , '' cried the Dominie , waving his rod which he had seized , `` you gave these drawings to Mr Knapps ; tell me from whom they came . ''
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 22]: The boys , frightened at the Dominie 's looks , immediately replied in a breath , `` From Barnaby Bracegirdle . ''
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 14]: `` Then , Barnaby Bracegirdle , from whom didst thou receive them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 4]: inquired the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 4]: Barnaby was dumbfounded .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 23]: `` Tell the truth ; didst thou not draw them thyself , since thou didst not receive them from other people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 30]: Barnaby fell upon his knees , and related the whole circumstances , particularly the way in which the Cornelius Nepos had been obtained through the medium of Mr Knapps .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 11]: The indignation of the Dominie was now beyond all bounds .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 9]: I never had seen him so moved before .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 46]: He appeared to rise at least a foot more in stature , his eyes sparkled , his great nose turned red , his nostrils dilated , and his mouth was more than half open , to give vent to the ponderous breathing from his chest .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 9]: His whole appearance was withering to the culprits .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 28]: `` For thee , thou base , degraded , empty-headed , and venomous little abortion of a man , I have no words to signify my contempt .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 34]: By the governors of this charity I leave thy conduct to be judged ; but until they meet , thou shalt not pollute and contaminate the air of this school by thy presence .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 29]: If thou hast one spark of good feeling in thy petty frame , beg pardon of this poor boy , whom thou wouldst have ruined by thy treachery .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 36]: If not , hasten to depart , lest in my wrath I apply to the teacher the punishment intended for the scholar , but of which thou art more deserving than even Barnaby Bracegirdle . ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 18]: Mr Knapps said nothing , hastened out of the school , and that evening quitted his domicile .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 10]: When the governors met he was expelled with ignominy .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 10]: `` Simon Swapps , hoist up Barnaby Bracegirdle . ''
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 19]: Most strenuously and most indefatigably was the birch applied to Barnaby , a second time , through me .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 13]: Barnaby howled and kicked , howled and kicked , and kicked again .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 8]: At last the Dominie was tired . ''
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 36]: _ Consonat omne nemus strepitu _ '' -LRB- for _ nemus _ read schoolroom -RRB- , exclaimed the Dominie , laying down the rod , and pulling out his handkerchief to wipe his face . ''
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 16]: _ Calcitrat , ardescunt germani coede bimembres _ , that last quotation is happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 6]: -LSB- cluck , cluck . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 91]: He then blew his nose , addressed the boys in a long oration -- paid me a handsome compliment upon my able defence -- proved to all those who chose to listen to him that innocence would always confound guilt -- intimated to Barnaby that he must leave the school , and then finding himself worn out with exhaustion , gave the boys a holiday , that they might reflect upon what had passed , and which they duly profited by in playing at marbles and peg in the ring .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 44]: He then dismissed the school , took me by the hand , and led me into his study , where he gave vent to his strong and affectionate feelings towards me , until the matron came to tell us that dinner was ready .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 7]: After this everything went on well .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 19]: The Dominie 's kindness and attention were unremitting , and no one ever thought of caballing against me .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 24]: My progress became most rapid ; I had conquered Virgil , taken Tacitus by storm , and was reading the Odes of Horace .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 29]: I had passed triumphantly through decimals , and was busily employed in mensuration of solids , when one evening I was seized with a giddiness in my head .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 21]: I complained to the matron ; she felt my hands , pronounced me feverish , and ordered me to bed .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 34]: I passed a restless night the next morning I attempted to rise , but a heavy burning ball rolled as it were in my head , and I fell back on my pillow .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 32]: The matron came , was alarmed at my state , and sent for the surgeon , who pronounced that I had caught the typhus fever , then raging through the vicinity .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 27]: This was the first time in my life that I had known a day 's sickness -- it was a lesson I had yet to learn .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 17]: The surgeon bled me , and giving directions to the matron , promised to call again .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 14]: In a few hours I was quite delirious -- my senses ran wild .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 22]: One moment I thought I was with little Sarah Drummond , walking in green fields , holding her by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 58]: I turned round , and she was no longer there , but I was in the lighter , and my hand grasped the cinders of my mother ; my father stood before me , again jumped overboard and disappeared ; again the dark black column ascended from the cabin , and I was prostrate on the deck .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 43]: Then I was once more alone on the placid and noble Thames , the moon shining bright , and the sweep in my hand , tiding up the reach , and admiring the foliage which hung in dark shadows over the banks .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 41]: I saw the slopes of green , so pure and so fresh by that sweet light , and in the distance counted the numerous spires of the great monster city , and beheld the various bridges spanning over the water .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 38]: The faint ripple of the tide was harmony , the reflection of the moon , beauty ; I felt happiness in my heart ; I was no longer the charity-boy , but the pilot of the barge .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 44]: Then , as I would survey the scene , there was something that invariably presented itself between my eyes and the object of my scrutiny ; whichever way I looked , it stood in my way , and I could not remove it .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 16]: It was like a cloud , yet transparent , and with a certain undefined shape .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 18]: I tried for some time , but in vain , to decipher it , but could not .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 35]: At last it appeared to cohere into a form -- it was the Dominie 's great nose , magnified into that of the Scripture , `` As the tower which looketh towards Damascus . ''
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 11]: My temples throbbed with agony -- I burned all over .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 50]: I had no exact notions of death in bed , except that of my poor mother , and I thought that I was to die like her ; the horrible fear seized me that all this burning was but prefatory to bursting out into flame and consuming into ashes .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 23]: The dread hung about my young heart and turned that to ice , while the rest of my body was on fire .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 12]: This was my last recollection , and then all was blank .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 46]: For many days I lay unconscious of either pain or existence : when I awoke from my stupor , my wandering senses gradually returning , I opened my eyes , and dimly perceived something before me that cut across my vision in a diagonal line .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 60]: As the mist cleared away , and I recovered myself , I made out that it was the nose of Dominie Dobiensis , who was kneeling at the bed-side , his nose adumbrating the coverlid of my bed , his spectacles dimmed with tears , and his long grey locks falling on each side , and shadowing his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 15]: I was not frightened , but I was too weak to stir or speak .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 15]: His prayer-book was in his hand , and he still remained on his knees .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 7]: He had been praying for me .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 27]: Supposing me still insensible , he broke out in the following soliloquy : -- '' _ Naviculator larvus pallidus _ -- how beautiful even in death !
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 20]: My poor lighter-boy , that hath mastered the rudiments , and triumphed over the Accidence -- but to die !
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 19]: _ Levior puer _ , a puerile conceit , yet I love it , as I do thee .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 7]: How my heart bleeds for thee !
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 17]: The icy breath of death hath whitened thee , as the hoar-frost whitens the autumnal rose .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 9]: Why wert thou transplanted from thine own element ?
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 42]: Young prince of the stream -- lord of the lighter -- ` _ Ratis rex et magister _ ' -- heir apparent to the tiller -- betrothed to the sweep -- wedded to the deck -- how art thou laid low !
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 12]: Where is the blooming cheek , ruddy with the browning air ?
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 7]: where the bright and swimming eye ?
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 3]: Alas where ?
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 25]: ` _ Tum breviter dirae mortis aperta via est _ , ' as sweet Tibullus hath it ; '' and the Dominie sobbed anew .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 55]: `` Had this stroke fallen upon me , the aged , the ridiculed , the little regarded , the ripe one for the sickle , it would have been well -- yet fain would I have instructed thee still more before I quitted the scene -- fain have left thee the mantle of learning .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 28]: Thou knowest , Lord , that I walk wearily , as in the desert , that I am heavily burdened , and that my infirmities are many .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 38]: Must I then mourn over thee , thou promising one -- must I say with the epigrammatist -- '' ` Hoc jacet in tumulo , raptus puerilibus annis , Jacob Faithful domini cura , doloroque sui ? '
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 6]: `` True , most true .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 22]: Thou hast quitted the element thou so joyously controlledst , thou hast come upon the terra firma for thy grave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 18]: ` Sis licet inde sibi tellus placata , levisque , Artifices levior non potes esse manu . '
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 24]: `` Earth , lay light upon the lighter-boy -- the lotus , the water-lily , that hath been cast on shore to die .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 21]: Hadst thou lived , Jacob , I would have taught thee the Humanities ; we would have conferred pleasantly together .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 17]: I would have poured out my learning to thee , my Absalom , my son ! ''
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 35]: He rose and stood over me ; the tears coursed down his long nose from both his eyes , and from the point of it poured out like a little rain-gutter upon the coverlid .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 19]: I understood not all his words , but I understood the spirit of them -- it was love .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 13]: I feebly stretched forth my arms , and articulated `` Dominie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 25]: The old man clasped his hands , looked upwards , and said , `` O God , I thank thee -- he will live .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 41]: Hush , hush , my sweet one , thou must not prate ; '' and he retired on tiptoe , and I heard him mutter triumphantly , as he walked away , `` He called me ` Dominie ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 17]: From that hour I rapidly recovered , and in three weeks was again at my duties .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 36]: I was now within six months of being fourteen years old , and Mr Drummond , who had occasionally called to ascertain my progress , came to confer with the Dominie upon my future prospects .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 44]: `` All that I can do for him , Mr Dobbs , '' said my former master , `` is to bind him apprentice to serve his time on the River Thames , and that can not be done until he is fourteen .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 11]: Will the rules of the school permit his remaining ? ''
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 16]: `` The regulations do not exactly , but I will , '' replied the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 41]: `` I have asked nothing for my long services , and the governors will not refuse me such a slight favour ; should they , I will charge myself with him , that he may not lose his precious time .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 18]: What sayest thou , Jacob , dost thou feel inclined to return to thy father Thames ? ''
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 20]: I replied in the affirmative , for the recollections of my former life were those of independence and activity .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 82]: `` Thou hast decided well , Jacob -- the tailor at his needle , the shoemaker at his last , the serving boy to an exacting mistress , and all those apprenticed to the various trades , have no time for improvement ; but afloat there are moments of quiet and peace -- the still night for reflection , the watch for meditation ; and even the adverse wind or tide leaves moments of leisure which may be employed to advantage .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 29]: Then wilt thou call to mind the stores of learning which I have laid up in thy garner , and wilt add to them by perseverance and industry .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 27]: Thou hast yet six months to profit by , and , with the blessing of God , those six months shall not be thrown away . ''
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 18]: Mr Drummond having received my consent to be bound apprentice , wished me farewell , and departed .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 31]: During the six months the Dominie pressed me hard , almost too hard , but I worked for _ love _ , and to please him I was most diligent .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 33]: At last the time had flown away , the six months had more than expired , and Mr Drummond made his appearance , with a servant carrying a bundle under his arm .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 62]: I slipped off my pepper-and-salt , my yellows and badge , dressed myself in a neat blue jacket and trousers , and with many exhortations from the Dominie , and kind wishes from the matron , I bade farewell to them and to the charity-school , and in an hour was once more under the roof of the kind Mrs Drummond .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 17]: But how different were my sensations to those which oppressed me when I had before entered .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 15]: I was no longer a little savage , uneducated and confused in my ideas .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 30]: On the contrary , I was full of imagination , confident in myself , and in my own powers , cultivated in mind , and proud of my success .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 12]: The finer feelings of my nature had been called into play .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 22]: I felt gratitude , humility , and love , at the same time that I was aware of my own capabilities .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 15]: In person I had much improved , as well as much increased in stature .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 22]: I walked confident and elastic , joying in the world , hoping , anticipating , and kindly disposed towards my fellow-creatures .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 48]: I knew , I felt my improvement , my total change of character , and it was with sparkling eyes that I looked up at the window , where I saw Mrs Drummond and little Sarah watching my return and reappearance after an absence of three years .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 43]: Mrs Drummond had been prepared by her husband to find a great change ; but still she looked for a second or two with wonder as I entered the door , with my hat in my hand , and paid my obeisance .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 12]: She extended her hand to me , which I took respectfully .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 23]: `` I should not have known you , Jacob ; you have grown quite a man , '' said she , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 25]: Sarah held back , looking at me with pleased astonishment ; but I went up to her , and she timidly accepted my hand .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 25]: I had left her as my superior -- I returned , and she soon perceived that I had a legitimate right to the command .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 65]: It was some time before she would converse , and much longer before she would become intimate ; but when she did so , it was no longer the little girl encouraging the untutored boy by kindness , or laughing at his absurdities , but looking up to him with respect and affection , and taking his opinion as a guide for her own .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 10]: I had gained the _ power of knowledge _ .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 63]: By the regulations of the Waterman 's Company , it is necessary that every one who wishes to ply on the river on his own account should serve as an apprentice from the age of fourteen to twenty-one ; at all events , he must serve an apprenticeship for seven years , and be fourteen years old before he signs the articles .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 62]: This apprenticeship may be served in any description of vessel which sails or works on the river , whether it be barge , lighter , fishing smack , or a boat of larger dimensions , and it is not until that apprenticeship is served that he can work on his own account , either in a wherry or any other craft .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 35]: Mr Drummond offered to article me on board of one of his own lighters free of all expense , leaving me at liberty to change into any other vessel that I might think proper .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 39]: I gratefully accepted the proposal , went with him to Watermen 's Hall , signed the papers , and thus was , at the age of fourteen , '' _ Bound ` prentice to a Waterman _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIX .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 38]: I AM RECOMMENDED TO LEARN TO SWIM , AND I TAKE A FRIENDLY ADVICE -- HEAVY SUSPICION ON BOARD OF THE LIGHTER , AND A MYSTERY , OUT OF WHICH MRS. RADCLIFFE WOULD HAVE MADE A ROMANCE .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 39]: `` Jacob , this is Marables , who has charge of the Polly barge , '' said Mr Drummond , who had sent for me into his office , a few days after my arrival at his house .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 41]: `` Marables , '' continued my protector , addressing the man , `` I have told you that this lad is bound ` prentice to the Polly ; I expect you will look after him , and treat him kindly .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 6]: No blows or ill treatment .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 29]: If he does not conduct himself well -LRB- but well I 'm sure he will -RRB- , let me know when you come back from your trip . ''
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 14]: During this speech I was scrutinising the outward man of my future controller .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 22]: He was stout and well-built , inclining to corpulence , his features remarkably good , although his eyes were not large .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 30]: His mouth was very small , and there was a good-natured smile on his lips as he answered , `` I never treated a cat ill , master . ''
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 46]: `` I believe not , '' replied Mr Drummond ; `` but I am anxious that Jacob should do well in the world , and therefore let you know that he will always have my protection , so long as he conducts himself properly . ''
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 45]: `` We shall be very good friends , sir , I 'll answer for it , if I may judge from the cut of his jib , '' replied Marables , extending to me an immense hand , as broad as it was long .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 16]: After this introduction , Mr Drummond gave him some directions , and left us together .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 40]: `` Come and see the craft , boy , '' said Marables and I followed him to the barge , which was one of those fitted with a mast which lowered down and hauled up again , as required .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 29]: She plied up and down the river as far as the Nore , sometimes extending her voyage still farther : but that was only in the summer months .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 12]: She had a large cabin abaft , and a cuddy forward .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 12]: The cabin was locked , and I could not examine it .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 26]: `` This will be your berth , '' said Marables , pointing to the cuddy-hatch forward ; `` you will have it all to yourself .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 9]: The other man and I sleep abaft . ''
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 9]: `` Have you another man , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 52]: `` Yes , I have , Jacob , '' replied he ; and then muttering to himself , `` I wish I had not -- I wish the barge was only between us , Jacob , or that you had not been sent on board , '' continued he , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 11]: `` It would have been better -- much better . ''
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 18]: And he walked aft , whistling in a low tone , looking down sadly on the deck .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 7]: `` Is your cabin large ? ''
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 8]: inquired I , as he came forward .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 22]: `` Yes , large enough ; but I can not show it to you now -- he has the key . ''
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 10]: `` What , the other man under you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' replied Marables , hastily .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 20]: `` I 've been thinking , Jacob , that you may as well remain on shore till we start .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 9]: You can be of no use here . ''
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 29]: To this I had no objection ; but I often went on board during the fortnight that the barge remained , and soon became very partial to Marables .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 23]: There was a kindness about him that won me , and I was distressed to perceive that he was often very melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 51]: What surprised me most was to find that during the first week the cabin was constantly locked , and that Marables had not the key ; it appeared so strange that he , as master of the barge , should be locked out of his own cabin by his inferior .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 33]: One day I went early on board , and found not only the cabin doors open , but the other man belonging to her walking up and down the deck with Marables .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 31]: He was a well-looking , tall , active young man , apparently not thirty , with a general boldness of countenance strongly contrasted with a furtive glance of the eye .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 30]: He had a sort of blue smock-frock over-all , and the trousers which appeared below were of a finer texture than those usually worn by people of his condition .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 16]: `` This is the lad who is bound to the barge , '' said Marables .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 8]: `` Jacob , this is Fleming . ''
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 28]: `` So , younker , '' said Fleming , after casting an inquiring eye upon me , `` you are to sail with us , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 14]: It 's my opinion that your room would be better than your company .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 19]: However , if you keep your eyes open , I 'd advise you to keep your mouth shut .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 30]: When I do n't like people 's company , I sometimes give them a hoist into the stream -- so keep a sharp look out , my joker . ''
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 33]: Not very well pleased with this address , I answered , `` I thought Marables had charge of the craft , and that I was to look to him for orders . ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 7]: `` Did you , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 7]: replied Fleming , with a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 12]: `` I say , my lad , can you swim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 18]: `` No , I ca n't , '' replied I -- `` I wish I could . ''
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 49]: `` Well , then , take my advice -- learn to swim as fast as you can for I have a strong notion that one day or other I shall take you by the scruff of the neck , and send you to look after your father . ''
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 3]: `` Fleming !
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 2]: Fleming !
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 5]: pray be quiet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 13]: said Marables , who had several times pulled him by the sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 39]: `` He 's only joking , Jacob , '' continued Marables to me , as , indignant at the mention of my father 's death , I was walking away to the shore , over the other lighters .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 45]: `` Well , '' replied I , turning round , `` if I am to be tossed overboard , it 's just as well to let Mr Drummond know , that if I 'm missing he may guess what 's become of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 3]: `` Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 3]: nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 22]: said Fleming , immediately altering his manner , and coming to me where I stood in the barge next to them .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 20]: `` Give us your hand , my boy ; I was only trying what stuff you were made of .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 12]: Come , shake hands ; I was n't in earnest . ''
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 11]: I took the proffered hand , and went on shore .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 24]: `` Nevertheless , '' thought I , `` I 'll learn to swim ; for I rather think he was in earnest . ''
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 21]: And I took my first lesson that day ; and by dint of practice soon acquired that very necessary art .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 48]: Had it not been for the threat of Fleming , I probably should not have thought of it ; but it occurred to me that I might tumble , even if I were not thrown overboard , and that a knowledge of swimming would do no harm .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 32]: The day before the barge was to proceed down the river to Sheerness , with a cargo of bricks , I called upon my worthy old master , Dominie Dobiensis . ''
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 6]: _ Salve puer _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 12]: cried the old man , who was sitting in his study .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 12]: `` Verily , Jacob , thou art come in good time .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 12]: I am at leisure , and will give thee a lesson .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 7]: Sit down , my child . ''
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 12]: The Dominie opened the Aeneid of Virgil , and commenced forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 40]: I was fortunate enough to please him with my off-hand translation ; and as he closed the book , I told him that I had called to bid him farewell , as we started at daylight the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 38]: `` Jacob , '' said he , `` thou hast profited well by the lessons which I have bestowed upon thee : now take heed of that advice which I am now about to offer to thee .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 32]: There are many who will tell thee that thy knowledge is of no use , for what avail can the Latin tongue be to a boy on board of a lighter .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 36]: Others may think that I have done wrong thus to instruct thee , as thy knowledge may render thee vain -- _ nil exactius eruditiusque est _ -- or discontented with thy situation in life .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 25]: Such is too often the case , I grant ; but it is because education is not as general as it ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 27]: Were all educated , the superiority acquired or presumed upon by education would be lost , and the nation would not only be wiser but happier .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 38]: It would judge more rightly , would not condemn the measures of its rulers , which at present it can not understand , and would not be led away by the clamour and misrepresentation of the disaffected .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 11]: But I must not digress , as time is short .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 36]: Jacob , I feel that thou wilt not be spoilt by the knowledge instilled into thee ; but mark me , parade it not , for it will be vanity , and make thee enemies .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 39]: Cultivate thyself as much as thou canst , but in due season -- thy duties to thy employer must be first attended to -- but treasure up what thou hast , and lay up more when thou canst .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 13]: Consider it as hidden wealth , which may hereafter be advantageously employed .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 33]: Thou art now but an apprentice in a barge ; but what mayest thou not be , Jacob , if thou art diligent -- if thou fear God , and be honest ?
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 17]: I will now call to my mind some examples to stimulate thee in thy career . ''
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 50]: Here the Dominie brought forward about forty or fifty instances from history , in which people from nothing had risen to the highest rank and consideration ; but although I listened to them very attentively , the reader will probably not regret the omission of the Dominie 's catalogue .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 21]: Having concluded , the Dominie gave me a Latin Testament , the Whole Duty of Man , and his blessing .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 39]: The matron added to them a large slice of seed-cake and by the time that I had returned to Mr Drummond 's , both the Dominie 's precepts and the matron 's considerate addition had been well digested .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 19]: It was six o'clock the next morning that we cast off our fastenings and pulled into the stream .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 57]: The day was lovely , the sun had risen above the trees , which feathered their boughs down on the sloping lawns in front of the many beautiful retreats of the nobility and gentry which border the river ; and the lamp of day poured a flood of light upon the smooth and rapidly ebbing river .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 125]: The heavy dew which had fallen during the night studded the sides of the barge , and glittered like necklaces of diamonds ; the mist and the fog had ascended , except here and there , where it partially concealed the landscape ; boats laden with the produce of the market-gardens in the vicinity were hastening down with the tide to supply the metropolis ; the watermen were in their wherries , cleaning and mopping them out , ready for their fares ; the smoke of the chimneys ascended in a straight line to heaven ; and the distant chirping of the birds in the trees added to the hilarity and lightness of heart with which I now commenced my career as an apprentice .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 24]: I was forward , looking down the river , when Marables called me to take the helm , while they went to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 26]: He commenced giving me instructions ; but I cut them short by proving to him that I knew the river as well as he did .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 28]: Pleased at the information , he joined Fleming , who was preparing the breakfast in the cabin , and I was left on the deck by myself .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 42]: There , as we glided by every object which for years I had not seen , but which was immediately recognised and welcomed as an old friend , with what rapidity did former scenes connected with them flash into my memory !
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 41]: There was the inn at the water-side , where my father used to replenish the stone bottle ; it was just where the barge now was that I had hooked and pulled up the largest chub I had ever caught .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 46]: Now I arrived at the spot where we had ran foul of another craft ; and my father , with his pipe in his mouth and his `` Take it coolly , '' which so exasperated the other parties , stood as alive before me .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 97]: Here -- yes , it was here -- exactly here -- where we anchored on that fatal night when I was left an orphan -- it was here that my father disappeared ; and as I looked down at the water , I almost thought I could perceive it again close over him , as it eddied by : and it was here that the black smoke -- The whole scene came fresh to my memory , my eyes filled with tears , and , for a little while , I could not see to steer .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 52]: But I soon recovered myself ; the freshness of the air , the bright sky overhead , the busy scene before me , and the necessity of attending to my duty , chased away my painful remembrances ; and when I had passed the spot I was again cheerful and content .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 27]: In half-an-hour I had shot Putney Bridge , and was sweeping clear of the shallows on the reach below , when Marables and Fleming came up .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 4]: `` How ! ''
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 10]: exclaimed Marables ; `` have we passed the bridge ?
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 8]: Why did you not call us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 26]: `` I have shot it without help many and many a time , '' replied I , `` when I was but ten years old .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 9]: Why should I call you from your breakfast ?
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 32]: But the tides are high now , and the stream rapid ; you had better get a sweep out on the bow , or we may tail on the bank . ''
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 28]: replied Fleming , with astonishment ; `` I had no idea that he would have been any help to us ; but so much the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 10]: He then spoke in a low tone to Marables .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 5]: Marables shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 13]: `` Do n't try it Fleming , it will never do . ''
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 14]: `` So you said once about yourself , '' replied Fleming , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 8]: `` I did -- I did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 49]: replied Marables , clenching both his hands , which at the time were crossed on his breast , with a look of painful emotion ; `` but I say again , do n't try it ; nay , I say more , you _ shall _ not . ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 5]: `` Shall not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 5]: replied Fleming , haughtily .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 23]: `` Yes , '' replied Marables , coolly ; `` I say shall not , and I 'll stand by my words .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 15]: Now , Jacob , give me the helm , and get your breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 31]: I gave up the helm to Marables , and was about to enter the cabin , when Fleming caught me by the arm , and _ slewed _ me round .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 18]: `` I say , my joker , we may just as well begin as we leave off .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 39]: Understand me , that into that cabin you never enter ; and understand further , that if ever I find you in that cabin , by day or night , I 'll break every bone in your body .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 27]: Your berth is forward ; and as for your meals , you may either take them down there or you may eat them on deck . ''
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 51]: From what I had already witnessed , I knew that for some reason or other , Fleming had the control over Marables ; nevertheless I replied , `` If Mr Marables says it is to be so , well and good ; but he has charge of this barge . ''
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 22]: Marables made no reply ; he coloured up , seemed very much annoyed , and then looked up to the sky .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 26]: `` You 'll find , '' continued Fleming , addressing me in a low voice , `` that I command here -- so be wise .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 24]: Perhaps the day may come when you may walk in and out the cabin as you please , but that depends upon yourself .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 19]: By-and-by , when we know more of each other -- '' `` Never , Fleming , never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 10]: interrupted Marables , in a firm and loud tone .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 9]: `` It _ shall _ not be . ''
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 65]: Fleming muttered what I could not hear , and going into the cabin , brought me out my breakfast which I despatched with good appetite ; and soon afterwards I offered to take the helm ; which offer was accepted by Marables , who retired to the cabin with Fleming , where I heard them converse for a long while in a low tone .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 14]: The tide was about three-quarters ebb when the barge arrived abreast of Millbank .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 24]: Marables came on deck , and taking the helm , desired me to go forward and see the anchor clear for letting go .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 5]: `` Anchor clear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 18]: said I. `` Why , we have a good hour more before we meet the flood . ''
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 21]: `` I know that , Jacob , as well as you do ; but we shall not go farther to-night .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 9]: Be smart , and see all clear . ''
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 56]: Whether Fleming thought that it was necessary to blind me , or whether it was true that they were only obeying their orders , he said to Marables in my hearing , `` Will you go on shore and give the letters to Mr Drummond 's correspondent , or shall I go for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 31]: `` You had better go , '' replied Marables , carelessly ; and shortly after they went to dinner in the cabin , Fleming bringing me mine out on deck .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 13]: The flood tide now made , and we rode to the stream .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 31]: Having nothing to do , and Marables as well as Fleming appearing to avoid me , I brought the Dominie 's Latin Testament , and amused myself with reading it .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 18]: About a quarter of an hour before dusk , Fleming made his appearance to go on shore .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 21]: He was genteelly , I may say fashionably , dressed in a suit of black , with a white neckcloth .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 53]: At first I did not recognise him , so surprised was I at his alteration ; and my thoughts , as soon as my surprise was over , naturally turned upon the singularity of a man who worked in a barge under another now assuming the dress and appearance of a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 10]: Marables hauled up the little skiff which lay astern .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 7]: Fleming jumped in and shoved off .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 64]: I watched him till I perceived him land at the stairs , and then turned round to Marables : `` I ca n't understand all this , '' observed I. `` I do n't suppose you can , '' replied Marables : `` but still I could explain it if you will promise me faithfully not to say a word about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 57]: `` I will make that promise if you satisfy me that all is right , '' answered I. `` As to all being right , Jacob , that 's as may be ; but if I prove to you that there is no harm done to our master , I suppose you will keep the secret .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 27]: However , I must not allow you to think worse of it than it really is ; no , I 'll trust to your good nature .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 9]: You would n't harm me , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 56]: Marables then told me that Fleming had once been well-to-do in the world , and during the long illness and subsequent death of Marables ' wife , had lent him money ; that Fleming had been very imprudent , and had run up a great many debts , and that the bailiffs were after him .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 83]: On this emergency he had applied to Marables to help him , and that , in consequence , he had received him on board of the barge , where they never would think of looking for him ; that Fleming had friends , and contrived to go on shore at night to see them , and get what assistance he could from them in money : in the meantime his relations were trying what they could do to arrange with his creditors .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 26]: `` Now , '' said Marables , after this narration , `` how could I help assisting one who has been so kind to me ?
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 9]: And what harm does it do Mr Drummond ?
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 32]: If Fleming ca n't do his work , or wo n't , when we unload , he pays another man himself ; so Mr Drummond is not hurt by it . ''
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 36]: `` That may be all true , '' replied I ; `` but I can not imagine why I am not to enter the cabin , and why he orders about here as master . ''
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 33]: `` Why , you see , Jacob , I owe him money , and he allows me so much per week for the cabin , by which means I pay it off .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 6]: Do you understand now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 29]: `` Yes , I understand what you have said , '' replied I. `` Well , then , Jacob , I hope you 'll say nothing about it .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 12]: It would only harm me , and do no good . ''
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 51]: `` That depends upon Fleming 's behaviour towards me , '' replied I. `` I will not be bullied and made uncomfortable by him , depend upon it ; he has no business on board the barge , that 's clear , and I am bound ` prentice to her .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 31]: I do n't wish to hurt you ; and as I suppose Fleming wo n't be long on board , I shall say nothing unless he treats me ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 14]: Marables then left me , and I reflected upon what he had said .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 13]: It appeared all very probable ; but still I was not satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 23]: I resolved to watch narrowly , and if anything occurred which excited more suspicions , to inform Mr Drummond upon our return .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 27]: Shortly afterwards Marables came out again , and told me I might go to bed , and he would keep the deck till Fleming 's return .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 19]: I assented , and went down to the cuddy ; but I did not much like this permission .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 32]: It appeared to me as if he wanted to get rid of me , and I laid awake , turning over in my mind all that I had heard and seen .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 23]: About two o'clock in the morning I heard the sound of oars , and the skiff strike the side of the barge .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 21]: I did not go up , but I put my head up the scuttle to see what was going on .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 12]: It was broad moonlight , and almost as clear as day .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 31]: Fleming threw up the painter of the skiff to Marables , and , as he held it , lifted out of the boat a blue bag , apparently well filled .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 11]: The contents jingled as it was landed on the deck .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 54]: He then put out a yellow silk handkerchief full of something else , and having gained the deck , Marables walked aft with the painter in his hand until the skiff had dropped astern , where he made it fast , and returned to Fleming , who stood close to the blue bag .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 25]: I heard Fleming ask Marables , in a low voice , if I were in bed , and an answer given in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 19]: I dropped my head immediately , that I might not be discovered , and turned into my bed-place .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 50]: I was restless for a long while ; thought upon thought , surmise upon surmise , conjecture upon conjecture , and doubt upon doubt , occupied my brain , until at last I went fast asleep -- so fast , that I did not wake until summoned by Fleming .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 30]: I rose , and when I came on deck found that the anchor had been weighed more than two hours , and that we were past all the bridges .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 44]: `` Why , Jacob , my man , you 've had a famous nap , '' said Fleming , with apparent good humour ; `` now go aft , and get your breakfast , it has been waiting for you this half-hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 40]: By the manner of Fleming I took it for granted that Marables had acquainted him with our conversation , and , indeed , from that time , during our whole trip , Fleming treated me with kindness and familiarity .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 20]: The veto had not , however , been taken off the cabin , which I never attempted to enter .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 16]: THE MYSTERY BECOMES MORE AND MORE INTERESTING , AND I DETERMINE TO FIND IT OUT .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 13]: -- PRYING AFTER THINGS LOCKED UP , I AM LOCKED UP MYSELF .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 19]: -- FLEMING PROVES TO ME THAT HIS ADVICE WAS GOOD WHEN HE RECOMMENDED ME TO LEARN TO SWIM .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 31]: On our arrival off the Medway , I had just gone down to bed and was undressing , when I heard Fleming come on deck and haul up the boat .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 30]: I looked up the hatchway ; it was very dark , but I could perceive Marables hand him the bag and handkerchief , with which he pulled on shore .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 22]: He did not return until the next morning at daylight , when I met him as he came up the side .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 36]: `` Well , Jacob , '' said he , `` you 've caught me , I 've been on shore to see my sweetheart ; but you boys ought to know nothing about these things .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 12]: Make the boat fast , there 's a good lad . ''
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 19]: When we were one night discharging our cargo , which was for government , I heard voices alongside .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 21]: From habit , the least noise now awoke me : a boat striking the side was certain so to do .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 7]: It was then about twelve o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 19]: I looked up the hatchway , perceived two men come on board and enter the cabin with packages .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 21]: They remained there about ten minutes , and then , escorted to the side by Fleming , left the barge .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 25]: When the barge was cleared , we hauled off to return , and in three days were again alongside of Mr Drummond 's wharf .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 13]: The kindness both of Marables and of Fleming had been very great .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 23]: They lived in a style very superior to what they could be expected to do , and I fared well in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 46]: On our arrival at the wharf , Marables came up to me , and said , `` Now , Jacob , as I have honestly told you the secret , I hope you wo n't ruin me by saying a word to Mr Drummond . ''
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 49]: I had before made up my mind to say nothing to my master until my suspicions were confirmed , and I therefore gave my promise ; but I had also resolved to impart my suspicions , as well as what I had seen , to the old Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 30]: On the third day after our arrival I walked out to the school , and acquainted him with all that had passed , and asked him for his advice .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 49]: `` Jacob , '' said he , `` thou hast done well , but thou mightest have done better ; hadst thou not given thy promise , which is sacred , I would have taken thee to Mr Drummond , that thou mightest impart the whole , instanter .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 5]: I like it not .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 7]: Evil deeds are done in darkness .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 9]: _ Noctem peccatis et fraudibus objice nubem _ .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 11]: Still , as thou sayest , nought is yet proved .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 22]: Watch , therefore , Jacob -- watch carefully over thy master 's interests , and the interests of society at large .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 15]: It is thy duty , I may say , _ Vigilare noctesque diesque _ .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 28]: It may be as Marables hath said -- and all may be accounted for ; still , I say , be careful , and be honest . ''
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 32]: I followed the suggestions of the Dominie : we were soon laden with another cargo of bricks , to be delivered at the same place , and proceeded on our voyage .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 22]: Marables and Fleming , finding that I had not said a word to Mr Drummond , treated me with every kindness .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 19]: Fleming once offered me money , which I refused , saying that I had no use for it .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 31]: I was on the best terms with them , at the same time that I took notice of all that passed , without offering a remark to excite their suspicions .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 98]: But not to be too prolix , it will suffice to say that we made many trips during several months , and that during that time I made the following observations : -- that Fleming went on shore at night at certain places , taking with him bags and bundles ; that he generally returned with others , which were taken into the cabin ; that sometimes people came off at night , and remained some time in the cabin with him ; and that all this took place when it was supposed that I was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 31]: The cabin was invariably locked when the barge was lying at the wharfs , if Fleming was on shore , and at no time was I permitted to enter it .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 47]: Marables was a complete cipher in Fleming 's hands , who ordered everything as he pleased ; and in the conversations which took place before me , with much less restraint than at first , there appeared to be no idea of Fleming 's leaving us .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 31]: As I felt convinced that there was no chance of discovery without further efforts on my part , and my suspicions increasing daily , I resolved upon running some hazard .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 32]: My chief wish was to get into the cabin and examine its contents ; but this was not easy , and would , in all probability , be a dangerous attempt .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 10]: One night I came on deck in my shirt .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 18]: We were at anchor off Rotherhithe : it was a dark night , with a drizzling rain .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 25]: I was hastening below , when I perceived a light still burning in the cabin , and heard the voices of Marables and Fleming .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 32]: I thought this a good opportunity , and having no shoes , walked softly on the wet deck to the cabin-door , which opened forward , and peeped through the crevices .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 13]: Marables and Fleming were sitting opposite each other at the little table .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 14]: There were some papers before them , and they were dividing some money .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 21]: Marables expostulated at his share not being sufficient , and Fleming laughed and told him he had earned no more .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 16]: Fearful of being discovered , I made a silent retreat , and gained my bed .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 76]: It was well that I had made the resolution ; for just as I was putting my head below the hatch , and drawing it over the scuttle , the door was thrown open and Fleming came out , I pondered over this circumstance , and the remark of Fleming that Marables had not earned any more , and I felt convinced that the story told me by Marables relative to Fleming was all false .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 49]: This conviction stimulated me more than ever to discover the secret , and many and many a night did I watch , with a hope of being able to examine the cabin ; but it was to no purpose , either Fleming or Marables was always on board .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 43]: I continued to report to the Dominie all I had discovered , and he agreed at last that it was better that I should not say anything to Mr Drummond until there was the fullest proof of the nature of their proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 25]: The cabin was now the sole object of my thoughts , and many were the schemes resolved in my mind to obtain an entrance .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 22]: Fatima never coveted admission to the dreadful chamber of Bluebeard as I did to ascertain the secrets of this hidden receptacle .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 15]: One night Fleming had quitted the barge , and I ascended from my dormitory .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 30]: Marables was on deck , sitting upon the water-cask , with his elbow resting on the gunwale , his hand supporting his head , as if in deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 13]: The cabin-doors were closed , but the light still remained in it .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 20]: I watched for some time , and perceiving that Marables did not move , walked gently up to him .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 15]: He was fast asleep ; I waited for some little time alongside of him .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 5]: At last he snored .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 9]: It was an opportunity not to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 11]: I crept to the cabin-door ; it was not locked .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 52]: Although I did not fear the wrath of Marables , in case of discovery , as I did that of Fleming , it was still with a beating heart and a tremulous hand that I gently opened the door , pausing before I entered , to ascertain if Marables were disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 14]: He moved not , and I entered , closing the door after me .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 19]: I caught up the light , and held it in my hand as I hung over the table .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 24]: On each side were the two bed-places of Marables and Fleming , which I had before then had many a partial glimpse of .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 14]: In front of the two bed-places were two lockers to sit down upon .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 14]: I tried them -- they were not fast -- they contained their clothes .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 28]: At the after part of the cabin were three cupboards ; I opened the centre one ; it contained crockery , glass , and knives and forks .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 20]: I tried the one on the starboard side ; it was locked , but the key was in it .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 15]: I turned it gently , but being a good lock , it snapped loud .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 10]: I paused in fear -- but Marables still slept .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 35]: The cupboard had three shelves , and every shelf was loaded with silver spoons , forks , and every variety of plate , mixed with watches , bracelets , and ornaments of every description .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 16]: There was , I perceived , a label on each , with a peculiar mark .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 30]: Wishing to have an accurate survey , and encouraged by my discovery , I turned to the cupboard opposite , on the larboard side , and I opened it .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 29]: It contained silk handkerchiefs in every variety , lace veils , and various other articles of value ; on the lower shelf were laid three pairs of pistols .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 54]: I was now satisfied , and closing the last cupboard , which had not been locked , was about to retreat , when I recollected that I had not re-locked the first cupboard , and that they might not , by finding it open , suspect my visit , I turned the key .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 8]: It made a louder snap than before .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 23]: I heard Marables start from his slumber on deck ; in a moment I blew out the lamp , and remained quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 26]: Marables got up , took a turn or two , looked at the cabin doors , which were shut , and opened them a little .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 28]: Perceiving that the lamp had , as he thought , gone out , he shut them again , and , to my consternation , turned the key .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 21]: There I was , locked up , until the arrival of Fleming -- then to be left to his mercy .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 26]: I hardly knew how to act : at last I resolved upon calling to Marables , as I dreaded his anger less than Fleming 's .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 45]: Then it occurred to me that Marables might come in , feel for the lamp to re-light it , and that , as he came in on one side of the cabin , I might , in the dark , escape by the other .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 15]: This all but forlorn hope prevented me for some time from applying to him .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 30]: At last I made up my mind that I would , and ran from the locker to call through the door , when I heard the sound of oars .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 20]: I paused again -- loitered -- the boat was alongside , and I heard Fleming jump upon the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 40]: `` Quick , '' said he to Marables , as he came to the cabin-door , and tried to open it ; `` We 've no time to lose -- we must get up the sacks and sink everything .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 15]: Two of them have ` peached , and the fence will be discovered . ''
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 20]: He took the keys from Marables and opened the door ; I had replaced the lamp upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 20]: Fleming entered , took a seat on the locker on the larboard side , and felt for the lamp .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 17]: Marables followed him , and sat down on the starboard locker ; -- escape was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 13]: With a throbbing heart I sat in silence , watching my fate .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 16]: In the meantime , Fleming had taken out of his pocket his phosphorus match box .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 20]: I heard the tin top pulled open -- even the slight rustling of the one match selected was perceived .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 27]: Another second it was withdrawn from the bottle , and a wild flame of light illumined the deck cabin , and discovered me to their view .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 36]: Staggered at my appearance , the match fell from Fleming 's hand , and all was dark as before ; but there was no more to be gained by darkness -- I had been discovered .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 4]: `` Jacob ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 3]: cried Marables .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 33]: `` Will not live to tell the tale , '' added Fleming , with a firm voice , as he put another match into the bottle , and then relighted the lamp .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 17]: `` Come , '' said Fleming , fiercely ; `` out of the cabin immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 6]: I prepared to obey him .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 20]: Fleming went out , and I was following him round his side of the table , when Marables interposed .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 14]: `` Stop : Fleming , what is that you mean to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 5]: `` Silence him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 3]: retorted Fleming .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 9]: `` But not murder him , surely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 9]: cried Marables , trembling from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 12]: `` You will not , dare not , do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 12]: `` What is it that I dare not do , Marables ?
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 15]: but it is useless to talk ; it is now his life or mine .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 16]: One must be sacrificed , and I will not die yet to please him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 15]: `` You shall not -- by God , Fleming , you shall not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 15]: cried Marables , seizing hold of my other arm , and holding me tight .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 40]: I added my resistance to that of Marables ; when Fleming , perceiving that we should be masters , took a pistol from his pocket , and struck Marables a blow on the head , which rendered him senseless .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 13]: Throwing away the pistol , he dragged me out of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 45]: I was strong , but he was very powerful ; my resistance availed me nothing : by degrees he forced me to the side of the barge , and lifting me in his arms , dashed me into the dark and rapidly flowing water .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 48]: It was fortunate for me that the threat of Fleming , upon our first meeting , had induced me to practise swimming , and still more fortunate that I was not encumbered with any other clothes than my shirt , in which I had come on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 40]: As it was , I was carried away by the tide for some time before I could rise , and at such a distance that Fleming , who probably watched , did not perceive that I came up again .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 26]: Still , I had but little hopes of saving myself in a dark night , and at nearly a quarter of a mile from shore .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 28]: I struggled to keep myself afloat , when I heard the sound of oars ; a second or two more and I saw them over my head .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 19]: I grasped at and seized the last , as the others passed me , crying `` Help ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 5]: `` What the devil !
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 21]: Oars , my men ; here 's somebody overboard , '' cried the man , whose oar I had seized .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 26]: They stopped pulling ; he dragged in his oar till he could lay hold of me , and then they hauled me into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 40]: I was exhausted with cold and my energetic struggles in the water ; and it was not until they had wrapped me up in a great-coat , and poured some spirits down my throat ; that I could speak .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 10]: They inquired to which of the craft I belonged .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 6]: `` The Folly barge . ''
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 9]: `` The very one we are searching for .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 9]: Where about is she , my lad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 21]: I directed them : the boat was a large wherry , pulling six oars , belonging to the river police .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 21]: The officer in the stern sheets , who steered her , then said , `` How came you overboard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 18]: `` I was thrown overboard , '' replied I , `` by a man called Fleming . ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 12]: `` The name he goes by , '' cried the officer .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 7]: `` Give way , my lads .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 14]: There 's murder , it appears , as well as other charges . ''
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 35]: In a quarter of an hour we were alongside -- the officer and four men sprang out of the boat , leaving the other two with directions for me to remain in the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 31]: Cold and miserable as I was , I was too much interested in the scene not to rise up from the stern sheets , and pay attention to what passed .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 28]: When the officer and his men gained the deck , they were met by Fleming in the advance , and Marables about a yard or two behind .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 7]: `` What 's all this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 5]: cried Fleming , boldly .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 12]: `` Are you river pirates , come to plunder us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 19]: `` Not exactly , '' replied the officer ; `` but we are just come to overhaul you .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 21]: Deliver up the key of your cabin , '' continued he , after trying the door and finding it locked .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 33]: `` With all my heart , if you prove yourselves authorised to search , '' replied Fleming ; `` but you 'll find no smuggled spirits here , I can tell you .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 18]: Marables , hand them the key ; I see that they belong to the river guard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 45]: Marables , who had never spoken , handed the key to the officer , who , opening a dark lanthorn , went down into the cabin and proceeded in his search , leaving two of the men to take charge of Fleming and Marables .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 19]: But his search was in vain ; he could find nothing , and he came out on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 17]: `` Well , '' said Fleming , sarcastically , `` have you made a seizure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 21]: `` Wait a little , '' said the officer ; `` how many men have you in this barge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 9]: `` You see them , '' replied Fleming .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 14]: `` Yes ; but you have a boy ; where is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 21]: `` We have no boy , '' replied Fleming ; `` two men are quite enough for this craft . ''
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 13]: `` Still I ask you , what has become of the boy ?
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 11]: for a boy was on your decks this afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 16]: `` If there was one , I presume he has gone on shore again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 14]: `` Answer me another question ; which of you threw him overboard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 27]: At this query of the officer , Fleming started , while Marables cried out , `` It was not I ; I would have saved him .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 11]: O that the boy were here to prove it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 87]: `` I am here , Marables , '' said I , coming on deck , `` and I am witness that you tried to save me , until you were struck senseless by that ruffian , Fleming , who threw me overboard , that I might not give evidence as to the silver and gold which I found in the cabin ; and which I overheard him tell you must be put into sacks and sunk , as two of the men had ` peached . ''
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 18]: Fleming , when he saw me , turned round , as if not to look at me .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 39]: His face I could not see ; but after remaining a few seconds in that position , he held out his hands in silence for the handcuffs , which the officer had already taken out of his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 23]: Marables , on the contrary , sprang forward as soon as I had finished speaking , and caught me in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 7]: `` My fine , honest boy !
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 8]: I thank God -- I thank God !
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 10]: All that he has said is true , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 22]: You will find the goods sunk astern , and the buoy-rope to them fastened to the lower pintle of the rudder .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 9]: Jacob , thank God , you are safe !
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 8]: I little thought to see you again .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 22]: There , sir , '' continued he to the officer , holding out his hands , `` I deserve it all .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 12]: I had not strength of mind enough to be honest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 55]: The handcuffs were put on Marables as well as on Fleming , and the officer , allowing me time to go down and put on my clothes , hauled up the sacks containing the valuables , and leaving two hands in charge of the barge , rowed ashore with us all in the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 33]: It was then about three o'clock in the morning , and I was very glad when we arrived at the receiving-house , and I was permitted to warm myself before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 18]: As soon as I was comfortable , I laid down on the bench and fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 9]: ONE OF THE UPS AND DOWNS OF LIFE .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 15]: -- UP BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES , THEN DOWN THE RIVER AGAIN IN THE LIGHTER .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 4]: -- THE TOMS .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 8]: -- A LIGHT HEART UPON TWO STICKS .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 8]: -- RECEIVE MY FIRST LESSON IN SINGING .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 11]: -- OUR LIGHTER WELL-MANNED WITH TWO BOYS AND A FRACTION .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 21]: I did not awake the next morning till roused by the police , who brought us up before the magistrates .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 32]: The crowd that followed appeared to make no distinction between the prisoners and the witness , and remarks not very complimentary , and to me very annoying , were liberally made .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 14]: `` He 's a young hand for such work , '' cried one .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 33]: `` There 's gallows marked in his face , '' observed another , to whom , when I turned round to look at him , I certainly could have returned the compliment .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 16]: The station was not far from the magistrates ' office , and we soon arrived .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 26]: The principal officer went into the inner room , and communicated with the magistrates before they came out and took their seats on the bench .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 6]: `` Where is Jacob Faithful ?
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 13]: My lad , do you know the nature of an oath ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 17]: I answered in the affirmative ; the oath was administered , and my evidence taken down .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 22]: It was then read over to the prisoners , who were asked if they had anything to say in their defence .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 16]: Fleming , who had sent for his lawyer , was advised to make no answer .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 14]: Marables quietly replied , that all the boy had said was quite true .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 28]: `` Recollect , '' said the magistrate , `` we can not accept you as king 's evidence ; that of the boy is considered sufficient . ''
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 13]: `` I did not intend that you should , '' replied Marables .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 17]: `` I only want to ease my conscience , not to try for my pardon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 13]: They were then committed for trial , and led away to prison .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 19]: I could not help going up to Marables and shaking his hand , before he was led away .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 55]: He lifted up his two arms , for he was still handcuffed , and wiped his eyes , saying , `` Let this be a warning to you , Jacob -- not that I think you need it ; but still I once was honest as yourself -- and look at me now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 12]: And he cast his eyes down sorrowfully upon his fettered wrists .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 28]: They quitted the room , Fleming giving me a look which was very significant of what my chance would be if ever I fell into his clutches .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 34]: `` We must detain you , my lad , '' observed one of the magistrates , `` without you can procure a sufficient bail for your appearance as witness on the trial . ''
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 31]: I replied that I knew of no one except my master , Mr Drummond , and my schoolmaster ; and had no means of letting them know of my situation .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 59]: The magistrate then directed the officer to go down by the first Brentford coach , acquaint Mr Drummond with what had passed , and that the lighter would remain in charge of the river police until he could send hands on board of her ; and I was allowed to sit down on the bench behind the bar .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 19]: It was not until past noon that Mr Drummond , accompanied by the Dominie , made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 27]: To save time , the magistrates gave them my deposition to read ; they put in bail , and I was permitted to leave the court .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 45]: We went down by the coach , but as they went inside and I was out , I had not many questions asked until my arrival at Mr Drummond 's house , when I gave them a detailed account of all that had happened .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 3]: `` Proh !
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 3]: Deus ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 11]: exclaimed the Dominie , when I had finished my story .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 5]: `` What an escape !
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 19]: How narrowly , as Propertius hath it femininely , ` _ Eripitur nobis jumpridem carus puer _ . '
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 17]: Well was it that thou hadst learnt to swim -- verily thou must have struggled lustily .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 20]: _ ` Pugnat in adversas ire natator aquas _ , ' yea , lustily for thy life , child .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 7]: Now , God be praised ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 49]: But Mr Drummond was anxious that the lighter should be brought back to the wharf ; he therefore gave me my dinner , for I had eaten nothing that day , and then despatched me in a boat with two men , to bring her up the river .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 65]: The next morning we arrived ; and Mr Drummond , not having yet selected any other person to take her in charge , I was again some days on shore , dividing my time between the Dominie and Mr Drummond 's , where I was always kindly treated , not only by him , but also by his wife and his little daughter Sarah .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 26]: A master for the lighter was soon found ; and as I passed a considerable time under his orders , I must describe him particularly .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 69]: He had served the best part of his life on board a man-of-war , had been in many general and single actions , and , at the battle of Trafalgar , had wound up his servitude with the loss of both his legs and an out-pension from the Greenwich Hospital , which he preferred to being received upon the establishment , as he had a wife and child .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 10]: Since that time he had worked on the river .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 79]: He was very active , and broad-shouldered , and had probably , before he lost his legs , been a man of at least five feet eleven or six feet high ; but as he found that he could keep his balance better upon short stumps than long ones , he had reduced his wooden legs to about eight inches in length , which , with his square body , gave him the appearance of a huge dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 14]: He bore , and I will say most deservedly , an excellent character .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 31]: His temper was always cheerful , and he was a little inclined to drink : but the principal feature in him was lightness of heart ; he was always singing .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 8]: His voice was very fine and powerful .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 25]: When in the service he used to be summoned to sing to the captain and officers , and was the delight of the forecastle .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 55]: His memory was retentive , and his stock of songs incredible , at the same time , he seldom or ever sang more than one or two stanzas of a song in the way of quotation , or if apt to what was going on , often altering the words to suit the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 61]: He was accompanied by his son Tom , a lad of my own age , as merry as his father , and who had a good treble voice and a good deal of humour ; he would often take the song up from his father , with words of his own putting in , with ready wit and good tune .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 29]: We three composed the crew of the lighter ; and , as there had already been considerable loss from demurrage , were embarked as soon as they arrived .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 43]: The name of the father was Tom Beazeley , but he was always known on the river as `` old Tom '' or , as some more learned wag had christened him , `` the _ Merman on two sticks _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 30]: As soon as we had put our traps on board , as old Tom called them , he received his orders , and we cast off from the wharf .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 5]: The wind was favourable .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 15]: Young Tom was as active as a monkey , and as full of tricks .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 70]: His father took the helm , while we two , assisted by a dog of the small Newfoundland breed , which Tom had taught to take a rope in his teeth , and be of no small service to two boys in bowsing on a tackle , made sail upon the lighter , and away we went , while old Tom 's strain might be heard from either shore .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 37]: `` Loose , loose every sail to the breeze , The course of the vessel improve , I 've done with the toil of the seas , Ye sailors , I 'm bound to my love .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 14]: `` Tom , you beggar , is the bundle ready for your mother ?
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 35]: We must drop the skiff , Jacob , at Battersea reach , and send the clothes on shore for the old woman to wash , or there 'll be no clean shirts for Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 15]: Shove in your shirts , Jacob ; the old woman wo n't mind that .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 8]: She used to wash for the mess .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 15]: Clap on , both of you , and get another pull at those haulyards .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 7]: That 'll do , my bantams .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 40]: `` Hoist , hoist , every sail to the breeze , Come , shipmates , and join in the song , Let 's drink while the barge cuts the seas , To the gale that may drive her along .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 10]: `` Tom , where 's my pot of tea ?
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 11]: Come , my boy , we must pipe to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 9]: Jacob , there 's a rope towing overboard .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 38]: Now , Tom , hand me my tea , and I 'll steer her with one hand , drink with the other , and as for the legs , the less we say about them the better .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 17]: `` No glory I covet , no riches I want , Ambition is nothing to me .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 34]: But one thing I beg of kind Heaven to grant -- '' Tom 's treble chimed in , handing him the pot -- `` For _ breakfast a good cup of tea _ .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 6]: `` Silence , you sea-cook !
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 9]: how dare you shove in your penny whistle !
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 7]: How 's tide , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 6]: `` Three quarters ebb . ''
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 17]: `` No , it a 'n' t , you thief ; how is it Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 8]: `` About half , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 7]: `` And you 're right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 12]: `` What water have we down here on the side ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 21]: `` You must give the point a wide berth , '' replied I ; `` the shoals runs out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 58]: `` Thanky , boy , so I thought , but was n't sure : '' and then old Tom burst out in a beautiful air : `` Trust not too much your own opinion , When your vessel 's under weigh , Let good advice still bear dominion ; That 's a compass will not stray . ''
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 9]: `` Old Tom , is that you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 7]: hallooed a man from another barge .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 13]: `` Yes ; what 's left of me , my hearty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 22]: `` You 'll not fetch the bridges this tide -- there 's a strong breeze right up the reaches below . ''
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 11]: `` Never mind , we 'll do all we can .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 28]: `` If unassailed by squall or shower , Wafted by the gentle gales Let 's not lose the favouring hour , While success attends our sails . ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 6]: `` Bravo , old Tom !
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 35]: why do n't the boys get the lines out , for all the fishes are listening for you , '' cried the man , as the barges were parted by the wind and tide .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 42]: `` I did once belong to a small craft called the Anon , '' observed old Tom , `` and they say as how the story was , that that chap could make the fish follow him just when he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 36]: I know that when we were in the North Sea the shoals of seals would follow the ship if you whistled ; but these brutes have ears -- now fish hav 'n' t got none .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 29]: `` Oh well do I remember that cold dreary land , here the northern light , In the winter 's night , Shone bright on its snowy strand .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 9]: `` Jacob , have you finished your breakfast ?
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 20]: Here , take the helm , while I and Tom put the craft a little into apple-pie order . ''
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 30]: Old Tom then stumped forward , followed by his son and the Newfoundland dog , who appeared to consider himself as one of the most useful personages on board .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 22]: After coiling down the ropes , and sweeping the decks , they went into the cabin to make their little arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 20]: `` A good lock that , Tom , '' cried the father , turning the key of the cupboard .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 21]: -LRB- I recollected it , and that its snapping so loud was the occasion of my being tossed overboard . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 35]: Old Tom continued : `` I say , Tom , you wo n't be able to open that cupboard , so I 'll put the sugar and the grog into it , you scamp .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 11]: It goes too fast when you 're purser 's steward .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 38]: `` For grog is our larboard and starboard , Our main-mast , our mizzen , our log , On shore , or at sea , or when harbour 'd , The mariner 's compass is grog . ''
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 18]: `` But it ar n't a compass to steer steady by , father , '' replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 15]: `` Then do n't you have nothing to do with it , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 18]: `` I only takes a little , father , because you may n't take too much . ''
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 17]: `` Thanky for nothing ; when do I ever take too much , you scamp ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 24]: `` Not too much for a man standing on his own pins , but too much for a man on two broomsticks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 25]: `` Stop your jaw , Mr Tom , or I 'll unscrew one of the broomsticks , and lay it over your shoulders . ''
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 17]: `` Before it 's out of the socket , I 'll give you _ leg-bail _ .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 9]: What will you do then , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 17]: `` Catch you when I can , Tom , as the spider takes the fly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 20]: `` What 's the good o ' that , when you ca n't bear malice for ten minutes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 6]: `` Very true , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 20]: then thank your stars that you have two good legs , and that your poor father has none . ''
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 38]: `` I very often do thank my stars , and that 's the truth of it ; but what 's the use of being angry about a drop of rum , or a handful of sugar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 10]: `` Because you takes more than your allowance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 15]: `` Well , do you take less , then all will be right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 11]: `` And why should I take less , pray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 23]: `` Because you 're only half a man ; you have n't any legs to provide for , as I have . ''
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 31]: `` Now , I tell you , Tom , that 's the very reason why I should have more to comfort my old body for the loss of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 34]: `` When you lost your legs you lost your ballast , father , and , therefore , you must n't carry too much sail , or you 'll topple overboard some dark night .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 17]: If I drink the grog , it 's all for your good , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 45]: `` You 're a dutiful son in that way , at all events ; and a sweet child , as far as sugar goes ; but Jacob is to sleep in the cabin with me , and you 'll shake your blanket forward . ''
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 15]: `` Now that I consider quite unnatural ; why part father and son ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 18]: `` It 's not that exactly , it 's only parting son and the grog bottle . ''
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 16]: `` That 's just as cruel ; why part two such good friends ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 17]: 'Cause , Tom , he 's too strong for you , and floors you sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 17]: `` Well , but I forgives him ; it 's all done in good humour . ''
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 17]: `` Tom , you 're a wag ; but you wag your tongue to no purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 17]: Liquor ai n't good for a boy like you , and it grows upon you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 9]: `` Well , do n't I grow too ?
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 5]: we grow together . ''
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 9]: `` You 'll grow faster without it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 17]: `` I 've no wish to be a tall man cut short , like you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 35]: `` If I had n't been a tall man , my breath would have been cut short for ever ; the ball which took my legs would have cut you right in half . ''
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 24]: `` And the ball that would take your head off , would whistle over mine ; so there we are equal again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 24]: `` And there 's the grog fast , '' replied old Tom , turning the key , and putting it into his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 17]: `` That 's a stopper over all ; so now we 'll go on deck . ''
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 26]: I have narrated this conversation , as it will give the reader a better idea of Tom , and his way of treating his father .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 28]: Tom was fond of his father , and although mischievous , and too fond of drinking when he could obtain liquor , was not disobedient or vicious .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 12]: We had nearly reached Battersea Fields when they returned on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 21]: `` Do you know , Jacob , how the parish of Battersea came into the possession of those fields ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 8]: `` No , I do not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 25]: `` Well , then , I 'll tell you ; it was because the Battersea people were more humane and charitable than their neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 24]: There was a time when those fields were of no value ; now they 're worth a mint of money , they say .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 36]: The body of a poor devil , who was drowned in the river , was washed on shore on those banks , and none of the parishes would be at the expense of burying it .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 36]: The Battersea people , though they had least right to be called upon , would not allow the poor fellow 's corpse to be lying on the mud , and they went to the expense .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 47]: Now , when the fields became of value , the other parishes were ready enough to claim them ; but the case was tried , and as it was proved that Battersea had buried the body , the fields were decided to belong to that parish .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 14]: So they were well paid for their humanity , and they deserved it .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 12]: Mr Drummond says you know the river well , Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 8]: `` I was born on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 17]: `` Yes , so I heard , and all about your father and mother 's death .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 21]: I was telling Tom of it , because he 's too fond of _ bowsing up his jib _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 28]: `` Well , father , there 's no occasion to remind Jacob ; the tear is in his eye already , '' replied Tom , with consideration .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 34]: `` I wish you never had any other _ drop _ in your _ eye _ , -- but never mind , Jacob , I did n't think of what I was saying .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 24]: Look ye , d'ye see that little house with the two chimneys -- that 's mine , and there 's my old woman .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 11]: -- I wonder what she 's about just now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 75]: Old Tom paused for a while , with his eyes fixed on the object , and then burst out : -- `` I 've crossed the wide waters , I 've trod the lone strand , I 've triumphed in battle , I 've lighted the brand , I 've borne the loud thunder of death o'er the foam ; Fame , riches , ne'er found them , -- yet still found a home .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 33]: `` Tom , boy , haul up the skiff and paddle on shore with the bundle ; ask the old woman how she is , and tell her I 'm hearty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 16]: Tom was in the boat in a moment , and pulling lustily for the shore .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 24]: `` That makes me recollect when I returned to my mother , a ` ter the first three years of my sea service .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 8]: I borrowed the skiff from the skipper .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 23]: -- I was in a Greenland-man , my first ship , and pulled ashore to my mother 's cottage under the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 12]: I thought the old soul would have died with joy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 44]: Here old Tom was silent , brushed a tear from his eye , and , as usual , commenced a strain , _ sotto voce _ : -- `` Why , what 's that to you if my eyes I 'm a wiping ?
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 13]: A tear is a pleasure , d'ye see , in its way .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 41]: `` How , miserable , '' continued he , after another pause , `` the poor thing was when I would go to sea -- how she begged and prayed -- boys have no feeling , that 's sartin . ''
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 51]: `` O bairn , dinna leave me , to gang far away , O bairn , dinna leave me , ye 're a ' that I hae , Think on a mither , the wind and the wave , A mither set on ye , her feet in the grave .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 21]: `` However , she got used to it at last , as the woman said when she skinned the ells .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 18]: Tom 's a good boy , Jacob , but not steady , as they say you are .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 29]: His mother spoils him , and I ca n't bear to be cross to him neither ; for his heart 's in the right place , after all .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 14]: There 's the old woman shaking her dish-clout at us as a signal .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 30]: I wish I had gone on shore myself , but I ca n't step into these paper-built little boats without my timber toes going through at the bottom . ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINE .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 31]: THE TWO TOMS TAKE TO PROTOCOLLING -- TREATY OF PEACE RATIFIED BETWEEN THE BELLIGERENT PARTIES -- LOTS OF SONGS AND SUPPER -- THE LARGEST MESS OF ROAST MEAT UPON RECORD .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 7]: Tom then shoved off the skiff .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 22]: When half-way between the lighter and the shore , while his mother stood watching us , he lay on his oars .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 6]: `` Tom , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 25]: cried his mother , shaking her fist at him , as he stooped down his head ; `` if you do , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 6]: `` Tom , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 17]: cried his father , shaking his fist also ; `` if you dare , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 39]: But Tom was not within reach of either party ; and he dragged a bottle out of the basket which his mother had entrusted to him , and putting it to his mouth , took a long swig .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 8]: `` That 's enough , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 8]: screamed his mother , from the shore .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 10]: `` That 's too much , you rascal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 8]: cried his father , from the barge .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 38]: Neither admonition was , however , minded by Tom , who took what he considered his allowance , and then very coolly pulled alongside , and handed up the basket and bundle of clean clothes on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 59]: Tom then gave the boat 's painter to his father , who , I perceived , intended to salute him with the end of it as soon as he came up ; but Tom was too knowing -- he surged the boat ahead , and was on deck and forward before his father could stump up to him .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 22]: The main hatch was open , and Tom put that obstacle between his father and himself before he commenced his parley .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 10]: said Tom , smiling , and looking at me .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 6]: `` Matter , you scamp !
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 8]: How dare you touch the bottle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 15]: `` The bottle -- the bottle 's there , as good as ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 15]: `` The grog is what I mean -- how dare you drink it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 22]: `` I was half-way between my mother and you , and so I drank success and long life to you both .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 10]: Ai n't that being a very dutiful son ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 14]: `` I wish I had my legs back again , you rascal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 16]: `` You wish you had the grog back again , you mean , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 20]: `` You have to choose between -- for if you had the grog you 'd keep your legs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 22]: `` For the matter of drinking the grog , you scamp , you seem determined to stand in my shoes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 19]: `` Well , shoes are of no use to you now , father -- why should n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 7]: Why do n't you trust me ?
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 16]: If you had n't locked the cupboard , I would n't have helped myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 15]: And Tom , whose bootlace was loose , stooped down to make it fast .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 58]: Old Tom , who was still in wrath , thought this a good opportunity , as his son 's head was turned the other way , to step over the bricks , with which , as I before said , the lighter had been laden level with the main hatchway , and take his son by surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 50]: Tom , who had no idea of this manoeuvre , would certainly have been captured , but , fortunately for him , one of the upper bricks turned over , and let his father 's wooden leg down between two of the piles , where it was jammed fast .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 11]: Old Tom attempted to extricate himself , but could not .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 19]: `` Tom , Tom , come here , '' cried he , `` and pull me out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 8]: `` Not I , '' replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 17]: `` Jacob , Jacob , come here ; Tom , run and take the helm . ''
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 8]: `` Not I , '' replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 29]: `` Jacob , never mind the helm , she 'll drift all right for a minute , '' cried old Tom ; `` come and help me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 36]: But I had been so amused with the scene , and having a sort of feeling for young Tom , that I declared it impossible to leave the helm without her going on the banks .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 21]: I therefore remained , wishing to see in what way the two Toms would get out of their respective scrapes .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 5]: `` Confound these -- !
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 14]: Tom , you scoundrel , am I to stick here all day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 12]: `` No , father , I do n't suppose you will .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 7]: I shall help you directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 13]: `` Well , then , why do n't you do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 8]: `` Because I must come to terms .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 16]: You do n't think I 'd help myself to a thrashing , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 9]: `` I wo n't thrash you , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 8]: Shiver my timbers if I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 17]: `` They 're in a fair way of being shivered as it is , I think .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 10]: Now , father , we 're both even . ''
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 6]: `` How 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 23]: `` Why you clapped a stopper over all on me this morning , and now you 've got one on yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 17]: `` Well , then , take off mine , and I 'll take off yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 14]: `` If I unlock your leg , you 'll unlock the cupboard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 14]: `` And you promise me a _ stiff one _ after dinner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 13]: `` Yes , yes , as stiff as I stand here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 18]: `` No , that will be too much , for it would _ set me fast _ .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 15]: I only like it about half-and-half , as I took it just now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 35]: Tom , who was aware that his father would adhere to his agreement , immediately went to his assistance , and throwing out some of the upper bricks , released him from his confinement .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 27]: When old Tom was once more on deck and on his legs , he observed , `` It 's an ill wind that blows nobody good .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 23]: The _ loss _ of my leg has been the _ saving _ of you many a time , Mr Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 14]: It was now time to anchor , as we were meeting the flood .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 31]: Tom , who officiated as cook , served up the dinner , which was ready ; and we were all very pleasant ; Tom treating his father with perfect confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 45]: As we had not to weigh again for some hours , our repast was prolonged , and old Tom , having fulfilled his promise to his son of a _ stiff one _ , took one or two himself , and became very garrulous .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 26]: `` Come , spin us a good yarn , father ; we 've nothing to do , and Jacob will like to hear you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 21]: `` Well , then , so I will , '' answered he ; `` what shall it be about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 12]: `` Fire and water , of course , '' replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 48]: `` Well , then , I 'll tell you something about both , since you wish it ; how I came into his Majesty 's sarvice , through _ fire _ , and how the officer who pressed me went out of it through _ water _ .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 48]: I was still ` prentice , and wanted about three months to sarve my time , when , of course , I should no longer be protected from sarving the king , when the ship I was in sailed up the Baltic with a cargo of bullocks .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 32]: We had at least two hundred on board , tied up on platforms on every deck , with their heads close to the sides , and all their sterns looking in-board .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 43]: They were fat enough when they were shipped , but soon dwindled away : the weather was very bad , and the poor creatures rolled against each other , and slipped about in a way that it pitied you to see them .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 37]: However , they were stowed so thick , that they held one another up , which proved of service to them in the heavy gales which tossed the ship about like a pea in a rattle .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 32]: We had joined a large convoy , and were entering the Sound , when , as usual , it fell calm , and out came the Danish gunboats to attack us .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 27]: The men-of-war who had charge of the convoy behaved nobly ; but still they were becalmed , and many of us were a long way astern .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 30]: Our ship was pretty well up ; but she was too far in-shore ; and the Danes made a dash at us with the hope of making a capture .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 31]: The men-of-war , seeing what the enemy were about , sent boats to beat them off ; but it was too late to prevent them boarding , which they did .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 46]: Not wishing to peep through the bars of the gaol at Copenhagen , we left the ship in our boats on one side , just as the Danes boarded on the other , and pulled towards the men-of-war 's armed boats coming to our assistance .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 39]: The men-of-war 's boats pulled right for the ship to retake her , which they did , certainly , but not before the enemy had set fire to the vessel , and had then pulled off towards another .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 41]: Seeing this , the men-of-war 's boats again gave chase to the Danes , leaving us to extinguish the flames , which were now bursting out fore and aft , and climbing like fiery serpents up to the main catharprings .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 49]: We soon found that it was impossible ; we remained as long as the heat and smoke would permit us , and then we were obliged to be off , but I shall never forget the roaring and moaning of the poor animals who were then roasting alive .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 18]: It was a cruel thing of the Danes to fire a vessel full of these poor creatures .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 80]: Some had broken loose , and were darting up and down the decks goring others , and tumbling down the hatchways ; others remained trembling , or trying to snuff up a mouthful of fresh air amongst the smoke ; but the struggling and bellowing , as the fire caught the vessel fore and aft , and was grilling two hundred poor creatures at once , was at last shocking , and might have been heard for a mile .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 6]: We did all we could .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 61]: I cut the throats of a dozen , but they kicked and struggled so much , falling down -LSB- upon -RSB- , and treading you under their feet ; and one lay upon me , and I expected to be burnt with them , for it was not until I was helped that I got clear of the poor animal .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 43]: So we stayed as long as we could , and then left them to their fate ; and the smell of burnt meat , as we shoved off , was as horrible as the cries and wailings of the poor beasts themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 46]: The men-of-war 's boats returned , having chased away the Danes , and very kindly offered us all a ship , as we had lost our own , so that you see that by _ fire _ I was forced into his Majesty 's sarvice .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 49]: Now , the boat that took us belonged to one of the frigates who had charge of the convoy , and the lieutenant who commanded the boat was a swearing , tearing sort of a chap , who lived as if his life was to last for ever .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 34]: `` After I was taken on board , the captain asked me if I would enter , and I thought that I might as well sarve the king handsomely , so I volunteered .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 33]: It 's always the best thing to do , when you 're taken , and ca n't help yourself , for you are more trusted than a pressed man who is obstinate .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 60]: I liked the sarvice from the first -- the captain was not a particular man ; according to some people 's ideas of the sarvice , she was n't in quite man-of-war fashion , but she was a happy ship , and the men would have followed and fought for the captain to the last drop of their blood .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 9]: That 's the sort of ship for me .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 13]: I 've seen cleaner decks , but I never saw merrier hearts .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 46]: The only one of the officers disliked by the men was the lieutenant who pressed me ; he had a foul mouth and no discretion ; and as for swearing , it was really terrible to hear the words which came out of his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 33]: I do n't mind an oath rapped out in the heat of the moment , but he invented his oaths when he was cool , and let them out in his rage .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 35]: We were returning home , after having seen the convoy safe , when we met with a gale of wind in our teeth , one of the very worst I ever fell in with .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 28]: It had been blowing hard from the South West , and then shifted to the North West , and made a cross sea , which was tremendous .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 42]: Now , the frigate was a very old vessel , and although they had often had her into dock and repaired her below , they had taken no notice of her upper works , which were as rotten as a medlar .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 50]: I think it was about three bells in the middle watch , when the wind was howling through the rigging , for we had no canvas on her ` cept a staysail and trysail , when the stay-sail sheet went , and she broached-to afore they could prevent her .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 114]: The lieutenant I spoke of had the watch , and his voice was heard through the roaring of the wind swearing at the men to haul down the staysail , that we might bend on the sheet , and set it right again ; when , she having , I said , broached-to , a wave -- ay , a wave as high as the maintop almost , took the frigate right on her broadside , and the bulwarks of the quarter-deck being , as I said , quite rotten , cut them off clean level with the main chains , sweeping them , and guns , and men , all overboard together .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 50]: The mizzenmast went , but the mainmast held on , and I was under its lee at the time , and was saved by clinging on like a nigger , while for a minute I was under the water , which carried almost all away with it to leeward .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 113]: As soon as the water passed over me , I looked up and around me -- it was quite awful ; the quarter-deck was cut off as with a knife -- not a soul left there , that I could see ; no man at the wheel -- mizzen-mast gone -- skylights washed away -- waves making a clear breach , and no defence ; boats washed away from the quarters -- all silent on deck , but plenty of noise below and on the main-deck , for the ship was nearly full of water , and all below were hurrying up in their shirts , thinking that we were going down .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 46]: At last the captain crawled up , and clung by the stancheons , followed by the first lieutenant and the officers , and by degrees all was quiet , the ship was cleared , and the hands were turned up to muster under the half-deck .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 25]: There were forty-seven men who did not answer to their names -- they had been summoned to answer for their lives , poor fellows !
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 12]: and there was also the swearing lieutenant not to be found .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 23]: Well , at last we got the hands on deck , and put her before the wind , scudding under bare poles .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 62]: As we went aft to the taffrail , the bulwark of which still remained , with about six feet of the quarter-deck bulwark on each side , we observed something clinging to the stern-ladder , dipping every now and then into the sea , as it rose under her counter , and assisted the wind in driving her before the gale .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 35]: We soon made it out to be a man , and I went down , slipped a bowling knot over the poor fellow , and with some difficulty we were both hauled up again .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 28]: It proved to be the lieutenant , who had been washed under the counter , and clung to the stern-ladder , and had thus miraculously been preserved .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 51]: It was a long while before he came to , and he never did any duty the whole week we were out , till we got into Yarmouth Roads ; indeed , he hardly ever spoke a word to any one , but seemed to be always in serious thought .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 47]: When we arrived , he gave his commission to the captain , and went on shore ; went to school again , they say , _ bore up for a parson _ , and , for all I know , he 'll preach somewhere next Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 22]: So you see , _ water _ drove him out of the sarvice , and _ fire _ forced me in .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 10]: There 's a yarn for you , Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 30]: `` I like it very much , '' replied I. `` And now , father , give us a whole song , and none of your little bits . ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 30]: Old Tom broke out with the `` Death of Nelson , '' in a style that made the tune and words ring in my ears for the whole evening .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 44]: The moon was up before the tide served , and we weighed our anchor ; old Tom steering , while his son was preparing supper , and I remaining forward , keeping a sharp look-out that we did not run foul of anything .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 76]: It was a beautiful night ; and as we passed through the several bridges , the city appeared as if it were illuminated , from the quantity of gas throwing a sort of halo of light over the tops of the buildings which occasionally marked out the main streets from the general dark mass -- old Tom 's voice was still occasionally heard , as the scene brought to his remembrance his variety of song .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 32]: `` For the murmur of thy lip , love , Comes sweetly unto me , As the sound of oars that dip , love , At moonlight on the sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 38]: I never was more delighted than when I heard these snatches of different songs poured forth in such melody from old Tom 's lips , the notes floating along the water during the silence of the night .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 33]: I turned aft to look at him ; his face was directed upwards , looking on the moon , which glided majestically through the heavens , silvering the whole of the landscape .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 76]: The water was smooth as glass , and the rapid tide had swept us clear of the ranges of ships in the pool ; both banks of the river were clear , when old Tom again commenced : -- `` The moon is up , her silver beam Shines bower , and grove , and mountain over ; A flood of radiance heaven doth seem To light thee , maiden , to thy lover . ''
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 9]: `` Jacob , how does the bluff-nob bear ?
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 6]: on the starboard bow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 24]: `` Yes -- broad on the bow ; you 'd better keep up half a point , the tide sweeps us fast . ''
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 18]: `` Very true , Jacob ; look out , and say when steady it is , boy .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 21]: `` If o'er her orb a cloud should rest , 'T is but thy cheek 's soft blush to cover .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 20]: He waits to clasp thee to his breast ; The moon is up -- go , meet thy lover .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 12]: `` Tom , what have you got for supper , boy ?
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 8]: What is that frizzing in your frying-pan ?
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 6]: Smells good , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 11]: `` Yes , and I expect will taste good too .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 22]: However , you look after the moon , father , and leave me and the frying-pan to play our parts . ''
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 11]: `` While I sing mine , I suppose , boy .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 37]: `` The moon is up , round beauty 's shine , Love 's pilgrims bend at vesper hour , Earth breathes to heaven , and looks divine , And lovers ' hearts confess her power . ''
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 34]: Old Tom stopped and the frying-pan frizzled on , sending forth an odour which , if not grateful to Heaven , was peculiarly so to us mortals , hungry with the fresh air .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 10]: `` How do we go now , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 28]: `` Steady , and all 's right ; but we shall be met with the wind next reach , and had better brail up the mainsail . ''
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 12]: `` Go , then , Tom , and help Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 52]: `` I ca n't leave the _ ingons _ , -LSB- onions -RSB- father , not if the lighter tumbled overboard ; it would bring more tears in my eyes to spoil them , now that they are frying so merrily , than they did when I was cutting them up .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 13]: Besides , the liver would be as black as the bends . ''
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 24]: `` Clap the frying-pan down on deck , Tom , and brail the sail up with Jacob , there 's a good boy .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 10]: You can give it another shake or two afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 19]: `` Guide on , my bark , how sweet to rove , With such a beaming eye above !
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 66]: `` That 's right , my boys , belay all that ; now to our stations ; Jacob on the look-out , Tom to his frying-pan , and I to the helm -- `` No sound is heard to break the spell , Except the water 's gentle swell ; While midnight , like a mimic day , Shines on to guide our moonlight way .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 14]: `` Well , the moon 's a beautiful creature -- God bless her !
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 34]: How often have we longed for her in the dark winter , channel-cruising , when the waves were flying over the Eddystone , and trying in their malice to put out the light .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 18]: I do n't wonder at people making songs to the moon , nor at my singing them .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 12]: We 'll anchor when we get down the next reach . ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 14]: We swept the next reach with the tide which was now slacking fast .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 15]: Our anchor was dropped and we all went to supper , and to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 50]: I have been particular in describing the first day of my being on board with my new shipmates , as it may be taken as a sample of our every day life ; Tom and his father fighting and making friends , cooking , singing , and spinning yarns .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 10]: Still , I shall have more scenes to describe .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 51]: Our voyage was made , we took in a return cargo , and arrived at the proprietor 's wharf , when I found that I could not proceed with them the next voyage , as the trial of Fleming and Marables was expected to come on in a few days .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 29]: The lighter , therefore , took in another cargo , and sailed without me ; Mr Drummond , as usual , giving me the run of his house .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 3]: CHAPTER TEN .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 50]: I HELP TO HANG MY LATE BARGEMATE FOR HIS ATTEMPT TO DROWN ME -- ONE GOOD TURN DESERVES ANOTHER -- THE SUBJECT SUDDENLY DROPPED AT NEWGATE -- A YARN IN THE LAW LINE -- WITH DUE PRECAUTIONS AND PREPARATIONS , THE DOMINIE MAKES HIS FIRST VOYAGE -- TO GRAVESEND .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 46]: It was on the 7th of November , if I recollect rightly , that Fleming and Marables were called up to trial at the Old Bailey , and I was in the court , with Mr Drummond and the Dominie , soon after ten o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 22]: After the judge had taken his seat , as their trial was first on the list , they were ushered in .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 8]: They were both clean and well dressed .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 25]: In Fleming I could perceive little difference ; he was pale , but resolute ; but when I looked at Marables I was astonished .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 55]: Mr Drummond did not at first recognise him -- he had fallen away from seventeen stone to , at the most , thirteen -- his clothes hung loosely about him -- his ruddy cheeks had vanished -- his nose was becoming sharp , and his full round face had been changed to an oblong .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 20]: Still there remained that natural good-humoured expression in his countenance , and the sweet smile played upon his lips .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 45]: His eyes glanced fearfully round the court -- he felt his disgraceful situation -- the colour mounted to his temples and forehead , and he then became again pale as a sheet , casting down his eyes as if desirous to see no more .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 23]: After the indictment had been read over , the prisoners were asked by the clerk whether they pleaded guilty or not guilty .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 13]: `` Not guilty , '' replied Fleming , in a bold voice .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 10]: `` John Marables -- guilty or not guilty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 23]: `` Guilty , '' replied Marables -- `` guilty , my lord ; '' and he covered his face with his hands .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 53]: Fleming was indicted on three counts ; -- an assault , with intent to murder ; having stolen goods in his possession ; and for a burglary in a dwelling-house , on such a date ; but I understand that they had nearly twenty more charges against him , had these failed .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 19]: Marables was indicted for having been an accessary to the last charge , as receiver of stolen goods .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 102]: The counsel for the crown , who opened the trial , stated that Fleming , _ alias _ Barkett , _ alias _ Wenn , with many more _ aliases _ , had for a long while been at the head of the most notorious gang of thieves which had infested the metropolis for many years ; that justice had long been in search of him , but that he had disappeared , and it had been supposed that he had quitted the kingdom to avoid the penalties of the law , to which he had subjected himself by his enormities .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 40]: It appeared however , that he had taken a step which not only blinded the officers of the police , but at the same time had enabled the gang to carry on their depredations with more impunity than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 52]: He had concealed himself in a lighter on the river , and appearing in her as one diligently performing his duty , and earning his livelihood as an honest man had by such means been enabled to extend his influence , the number of his associates , and his audacious schemes .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 56]: The principal means of detection in cases of burglary was by advertising the goods , and the great difficulty on the part of such miscreants was to obtain a ready sale for them -- the receivers of stolen goods being aware that the thieves were at their mercy , and must accept what was offered .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 91]: Now , to obviate these difficulties , Fleming had , as we before observed , concealed himself from justice on board of a river barge , which was made the receptacle for stolen goods : those which had been nefariously obtained at one place being by him and his associates carried up and down the river in the craft , and disposed of at a great distance , by which means the goods were never brought to light , so as to enable the police to recognise or trace them .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 92]: This system had now been carried on with great success for upwards of twelve months , and would , in all probability , have not been discovered even now , had it not been that a quarrel as to profits had taken place , which had induced two of his associates to give information to the officers ; and these two associates had also been permitted to turn king 's evidence , in a case of burglary , in which Fleming was a principal , provided that it was considered necessary .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 74]: But there was a more serious charge against the prisoner , -- that of having attempted the life of a boy , named Jacob Faithful , belonging to the lighter , and who , it appeared , had suspicions of what was going on , and , in duty to his master , had carefully watched the proceedings , and given notice to others of what he had discovered from time to time .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 53]: The lad was the chief evidence against the prisoner Fleming , and also against Marables , the other prisoner , of whom he could only observe , that circumstances would transpire , during the trial , in his favour , which he had no doubt would be well considered by his lordship .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 20]: He would not detain the gentlemen of the jury any longer , but at once call on his witnesses .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 61]: I was then summoned , again asked the same questions as to the nature of an oath , and the judge being satisfied with my replies , I gave my evidence as before ; the judge as I perceived , carefully examining my previous disposition , to ascertain if anything I now said was at variance with my former assertions .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 45]: I was then cross-examined by the counsel for Fleming , but he could not make me vary in my evidence , I did , however , take the opportunity , whenever I was able , of saying all I could in favour of Marables .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 13]: At last the counsel said he would ask me no more questions .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 40]: I was dismissed ; and the police-officer who had picked me up , and other parties who identified the various property as their own , and the manner in which they had been robbed of it , were examined .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 10]: The evidence was too clear to admit of doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 24]: The jury immediately returned a verdict of guilty against Fleming and Marables , but strongly recommended Marables to the mercy of the crown .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 17]: The judge rose , put on his black cap , and addressed the prisoners as follows .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 53]: The court was so still , that a pin falling might have been heard : -- `` You , William Fleming , have been tried by a jury of your countrymen , upon the charge of receiving stolen goods , to which you have added the most atrocious crime of intended murder .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 53]: You have had a fair and impartial trial , and have been found guilty ; and it appears that , even had you escaped in this instance , other charges , equally heavy , and which would equally consign you to condign punishment , were in readiness to be preferred against you .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 41]: Your life has been one of guilt , not only in your own person , but also in abetting and stimulating others to crime ; and you have wound up your shameful career by attempting the life of a fellow-creature .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 12]: To hold out to you any hope of mercy is impossible .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 68]: Your life is justly forfeited to the offended laws of your country ; and your sentence is that you be removed from this court to the place from whence you came , and from thence to the place of execution , there to be hanged by the neck till you are dead ; and may God , in his infinite goodness , have mercy on your soul !
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 54]: `` You , John Marables , have pleaded guilty to the charges brought against you ; and it has appeared , during the evidence brought out on the trial , that , although you have been a party to these nefarious transactions , you are far from being hardened in your guilt . ''
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 7]: -LSB- `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 4]: exclaimed Marables . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 46]: `` I believe sincerely that you are not , and much regret that one who , from the evidence brought forward , appears to have been , previously to this unfortunate connection , an honest man , should now appear in so disgraceful a situation .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 50]: A severe punishment is , however , demanded by the voice of justice , and by that sentence of the law you must now be condemned : at the same time I trust that an appeal to the mercy of your sovereign will not be made in vain . ''
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 33]: The judge then passed the sentence upon Marables , the prisoners were led out of court , and a new trial commenced ; while Mr Drummond and the Dominie conducted me home .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 39]: About a week after the trial , Fleming suffered the penalty of the law ; while Marables was sentenced to transportation for life , which , however , previous to his sailing , was commuted to seven years .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 8]: In a few days the lighter returned .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 83]: Her arrival was announced to me one fine sunny morning as I lay in bed , by a voice whose well-known notes poured into my ear as I was half dozing on my pillow : -- `` Bright are the beams of the morning sky , And sweet the dew the red blossoms sip , But brighter the glances of dear woman 's eye -- `` Tom , you monkey , belay the warp , and throw the fenders over the side .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 14]: Be smart , or old Fuzzle will be growling about his red paint .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 11]: `` And sweet is the dew on her lip . ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 68]: I jumped out of my little crib , threw open the window , the panes of which were crystallised with the frost in the form of little trees , and beheld the lighter just made fast to the wharf , the sun shining brightly , old Tom 's face as cheerful as the morn , and young Tom laughing , jumping about , and blowing his fingers .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 12]: I was soon dressed , and shaking hands with my barge-mates .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 13]: `` Well , Jacob , how do you like the Old Bailey ?
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 39]: Never was in it but once in my life , and never mean to go again if I can help it ; that was when Sam Bowles was tried for his life , but my evidence saved him .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 8]: I 'll tell you how it was .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 21]: Tom , look a ` ter the breakfast ; a bowl of tea this cold morning will be worth having .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 6]: Come , jump about . ''
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 15]: `` But I never heard the story of Sam Bowles , '' answered Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 7]: `` What 's that to you ?
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 8]: I 'm telling it to Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 14]: `` But I want to hear it -- so go on , father .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 5]: I 'll start you .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 27]: Well , d'ye see , Sam Bowles -- '' `` Master Tom , them as play with _ bowls _ may meet with _ rubbers _ .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 12]: Take care I do n't _ rub _ down your hide .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 10]: Off , you thief , and get breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 26]: `` No , I wo n't : if I do n't have your _ Bowles _ you shall have no _ bowls _ of tea .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 10]: I 've made my mind up to that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 25]: `` I tell you what , Tom ; I shall never get any good out of you until I have both your legs ampitated .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 12]: I 've a great mind to send for the farrier . ''
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 13]: `` Thanky , father ; but I find them very useful . ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 31]: `` Well , '' said I , `` suppose we put off the story till breakfast time ; and I 'll go and help Tom to get it ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 7]: `` Be it so , Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 14]: I suppose Tom must have his way , as I spoiled him myself .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 17]: I made him so fond of yarns , so I was a fool to be vexed .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 42]: `` Oh , life is a river , and man is the boat That over its surface is destined to float ; And joy is a cargo so easily stored , That he is a fool who takes sorrow on board .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 20]: `` Now I 'll go on shore to master , and find out what 's to be done next .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 18]: Give me my stick , boy , and I shall crawl over the planks a little safer .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 12]: A safe stool must have three legs , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 8]: Old Tom then stumped away on shore .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 15]: In about a quarter of an hour he returned , bringing half-a-dozen red herrings .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 9]: `` Here , Tom , grill these sodgers .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 25]: Jacob , who is that tall old chap , with such a devil of a cutwater , which I met just now with master ?
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 18]: We are bound for Sheerness this trip , and I 'm to land him at Greenwich . ''
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 7]: `` What , the Dominie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 9]: replied I , from old Tom 's description .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 16]: `` His name did begin with a D , but that was n't it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 4]: `` Dobbs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 29]: `` Yes , that 's nearer ; he 's to be a passenger on board of us , going down to see a friend who 's very ill .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 21]: Now , Tom , my hearty , bring out the crockery , for I want a little inside lining . ''
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 27]: We all sat down to our breakfast , and as soon as old Tom had finished , his son called for the history of Sam Bowles .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 9]: `` Well , now you shall have it .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 35]: Sam Bowles was a shipmate of mine on board of the Greenlandman ; he was one of our best harpooners , and a good , quiet , honest messmate as ever slung a hammock .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 26]: He was spliced to as pretty a piece of flesh as ever was seen , but she was n't as good as she was pretty .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 41]: We were fitting out for another voyage , and his wife had been living on board with him some weeks , for Sam was devilish spoony on her , and could n't bear her to be out of his sight .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 29]: As we ` spected to sail in a few days , we were filling up our complement of men , and fresh hands came on board every day .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 42]: `` One morning , a fine tall fellow , with a tail as thick as a hawser , came on board and offered himself ; he was taken by the skipper , and went on shore again to get his traps .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 44]: While he was still on deck I went below , and seeing Sam with his little wife on his knee playing with his love-locks , I said that there was a famous stout and good-looking fellow that we should have as a shipmate .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 26]: Sam 's wife , who , like all women , was a little curious , put her head up the hatchway to look at him .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 48]: She put it down again very quick , as I thought , and made some excuse to go forward in the eyes of her , where she remained some time , and then , when she came aft , told Sam that she would go on shore .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 50]: Now , as it had been agreed that she should remain on board till we were clear of the river , Sam could n't think what the matter was ; but she was positive , and go away she did , very much to Sam 's astonishment and anger .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 23]: In the evening , Sam went on shore and found her out , and what d'ye think the little Jezebel told him ?
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 29]: -- why , that one of the men had been rude to her when she went forward , and that 's why she would n't stay on board .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 41]: Sam was in a devil of a passion at this , and wanted to know which was the man ; but she fondled him , and would n't tell him , because she was afraid that he 'd be hurt .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 15]: At last she bamboozled him , and sent him on board again quite content .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 39]: Well , we remained three days longer , and then dropped down the river to Greenwich , where the captain was to come on board , and we were to sail as soon as the wind was fair .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 67]: Now , this fine tall fellow was with us when we dropped down the river , and as Sam was sitting down on his chest eating a basin o ' soup , the other man takes out a ` baccy pouch of seal-skin ; -- it was a very curious one , made out of the white and spotted part of a young seal 's belly .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 19]: ` I say , shipmate , ' cries Sam , ` hand me over my ` baccy pouch .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 9]: Where did you pick it up ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 5]: ` Your pouch ! '
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 23]: says he to him ; ` I killed the seal , and my fancy girl made the pouch for me . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 9]: ` Well , if that ai n't cool !
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 12]: you 'd swear a man out of his life , mate .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 27]: Tom , ' says he to me , ` ai n't that my pouch which my wife gave me when I came back last trip ? '
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 16]: `` I looked at it , and knew it again , and said it was .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 15]: The tall fellow denied it , and there was a devil of a bobbery .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 19]: Sam called him a thief , and he pitched Sam right down the main hatchway among the casks .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 22]: After that there was a regular set-to , and Sam was knocked all to shivers , and obliged to give in .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 18]: When the fight was over , I took up Sam 's shirt for him to put on .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 13]: ` That 's my shirt , ' cried the tall fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 20]: ` That 's Sam 's shirt , ' replied I ; ` I know it 's his . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 30]: ` I tell you it 's mine , ' replied the man ; ` my lass gave it to me to put on when I got up this morning .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 7]: The other is his shirt . '
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 15]: `` We looked at the other , and they both were Sam 's shirts .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 54]: Now when Sam heard this , he put two and two together , and became very jealous and uneasy : he thought it odd that his wife was so anxious to leave the ship when this tall fellow came on board ; and what with the pouch and the shirt he was puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 14]: His wife had promised to come down to Greenwich and see him off .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 18]: When we anchored , some of the men went on shore -- among others the tall fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 38]: Sam , whose head was swelled up like a pumpkin , told one of his shipmates to say to his wife that he could not come on shore , and that she must come off to him .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 44]: Well , it was about nine o'clock , dark , and all the stars were twinkling , when Sam says to me , ` Tom , let 's go on shore ; my black eyes ca n't be seen in the dark . '
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 31]: As we hauled up the boat , the second mate told Sam to take his harpoon-iron on shore for him , to have the hole for the becket punched larger .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 33]: Away we went , and the first place , of course , that Sam went to , was the house where he knew that his wife put up at , as before .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 12]: He went upstairs to her room , and I followed him .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 12]: The door was not made fast , and in we went .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 19]: There was his little devil of a wife , fast asleep in the arms of the tall fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 31]: Sam could n't command his rage , and having the harpoon-iron in his hand , he drove it right through the tall fellow 's body before I could prevent him .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 21]: It was a dreadful sight : the man groaned , and his head fell over the side of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 24]: Sam 's wife screamed , and made Sam more wroth by throwing herself on the man 's body , and weeping over it .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 18]: Sam would have pulled out the iron to run her through with , but that was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 21]: The noise brought up the people of the house , and it was soon known that murder had been committed .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 21]: The constable came , Sam was thrown into prison , and I went on board and told the whole story .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 77]: Well , we were just about to heave up , for we had shipped two more men in place of Sam , who was to be tried for his life , and the poor fellow he had killed , when a lawyer chap came on board with what they call a _ suppeny _ for me ; all I know is , that the lawyer pressed me into his service , and I lost my voyage .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 15]: I was taken on shore , and well fed till the trial came on .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 9]: Poor Sam was at the bar for murder .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 35]: The gentleman in his gown and wig began his yarn , stating that how the late fellow , whose name was Will Errol , was with his own wife when Sam harpooned him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 7]: ` That 's a lie ! '
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 10]: cried Sam ; ` he was with my wife .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 3]: False papers !
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 20]: Here are mine ; ' and he pulled out his tin case , and handed them to the court .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 38]: `` The judge said that this was not the way to try people and that Sam must hold his tongue ; so the trial went on , and at first they had it all their own way .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 46]: Then our turn came , and I was called up to prove what had passed , and I stated how the man was with Sam 's wife , and how he , having the harpoon-iron in his hand , had run it through his body .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 55]: Then they compared the certificates , and it was proved that the little Jezebel had married them both ; but she had married Sam first , so he had the most right to her ; but fancying the other man afterwards , she thought she might as well have two strings to her bow .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 41]: So the judge declared that she was Sam 's wife , and that any man , even without the harpoon in his hand , would be justified in killing a man whom he found in bed with his own wife .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 51]: So Sam went scot-free ; but the judge would n't let off Sam 's wife , as she had caused murder by her wicked conduct ; he tried her a ` terwards for _ biggery _ , as they call it , and sent her over the water for life .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 31]: Sam never held up his head a ` terwards ; what with having killed an innocent man , and the ` haviour of his wife , he was always down .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 30]: He went out to the fishery , and a whale cut the boat in two with her tail ; Sam was stunned , and went down like a stone .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 25]: So you see the mischief brought about by this little Jezebel , who must have two husbands , and be damned to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 22]: `` Well , that 's a good yarn , father , '' said Tom , as soon as it was finished .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 11]: `` I was right in saying I would hear it .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 5]: Was n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 44]: `` No , '' replied old Tom , putting out his large hand , and seizing his son by the collar ; `` and now you 've put me in mind of it , I 'll pay you off for old scores . ''
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 18]: `` Lord love you , father , you do n't owe me anything , '' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 18]: `` Yes , I do ; and now I 'll give you a receipt in full . ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 4]: `` O Lord !
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 20]: they 'll be drowned , '' screamed Tom , holding up both his hands with every symptom of terror .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 16]: Old Tom turned short round to look in the direction , letting go his hold .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 10]: Tom made his escape , and burst out a-laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 12]: I laughed also , and so at last did his father .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 24]: I went on shore , and found that old Tom 's report was correct -- the Dominie was at breakfast with Mr Drummond .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 27]: The new usher had charge of the boys , and the governors had allowed him a fortnight 's holiday to visit an old friend at Greenwich .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 24]: To save expense , as well as to indulge his curiosity , the old man had obtained a passage down in the lighter .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 48]: `` Never yet , Jacob , have I put my feet into that which floateth on the watery element , '' observed he to me ; `` nor would I now , but that it saveth money , which thou knowest well is with me not plentiful .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 45]: Many dangers I expect , many perils shall I encounter ; such have I read of in books ; and well might Horace exclaim -- ` _ Ille robur et aes triplex _ , ' with reference to the first man who ventured afloat .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 48]: Still doth Mr Drummond assure me that the lighter is of that strength as to be able to resist the force of the winds and waves ; and , confiding in Providence , I intend to venture , Jacob , ` _ te duce _ . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 37]: `` Nay , sir , '' replied I , laughing at the idea which the Dominie appeared to have formed of the dangers of river navigation , `` old Tom is the _ Dux _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 11]: `` Old Tom ; where have I seen that name ?
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 41]: Now I do recall to mind that I have seen the name painted in large letters upon a cask at the tavern bar of the inn at Brentford ; but what it did intend to signify I did not inquire .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 6]: What connection is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 18]: `` None , '' replied I ; `` but I rather think they are very good friends .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 17]: The tide turns in half-an-hour , sir ; are you ready to go on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 31]: `` Truly am I , and well prepared , having my habiliments in a bundle , my umbrella and my great-coat , as well as my spencer for general wear .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 15]: But where I am to sleep hath not yet been made known to me .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 14]: Peradventure one sleepeth not -- ` _ tanto in periculo _ . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 8]: `` Yes , sir , we do .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 16]: You shall have my berth , and I 'll turn in with young Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 19]: `` Hast thou , then , a young Tom as well as an old Tom on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 18]: `` Yes , sir ; and a dog , also , of the name of Tommy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 21]: `` Well , then , we will embark , and thou shalt make me known to this triad of Thomases .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 12]: ` _ Inde _ Tomos _ dictus locus est _ . '
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 8]: -LRB- _ Cluck , cluck _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 7]: Ovid , I thank thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 3]: CHAPTER ELEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 59]: MUCH LEARNING AFLOAT -- YOUNG TOM IS VERY LIVELY UPON THE DEAD LANGUAGES -- THE DOMINIE , AFTER EXPERIENCING THE WONDERS OF THE MIGHTY DEEP , PREPARES TO REVEL UPON LOBSCOUSE -- THOUGH THE MAN OF LEARNING GETS MANY SONGS AND SOME YARNS FROM OLD TOM , HE LOSES THE BEST PART OF A TALE WITHOUT KNOWING IT .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 60]: The old Dominie 's bundle and other paraphernalia being sent on board , he took farewell of Mr Drummond and his family in so serious a manner , that I was convinced that he considered he was about to enter upon a dangerous adventure , and then I led him down to the wharf where the lighter lay alongside .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 24]: It was with some trepidation that he crossed the plank , and got on board , when he recovered himself and looked round .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 17]: `` My sarvice to you , old gentleman , '' said a voice behind the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 15]: It was that of old Tom , who had just come from the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 10]: The Dominie turned round , and perceived old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 20]: `` This is old Tom , sir , '' said I to the Dominie , who stared with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 6]: `` Art thou , indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 22]: Jacob , thou didst not tell me that he had been curtailed of his fair proportions , and I was surprised .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 6]: Art thou then Dux ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 8]: continued the Dominie , addressing old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 38]: `` Yes , '' interrupted young Tom , who had come from forward , `` he is _ ducks _ , because he waddles on his short stumps ; and I wo n't say who be goose .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 5]: Eh , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 22]: `` Take care you do n't _ buy goose _ , for your imperance , sir , '' cried old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 10]: `` A forward boy , '' exclaimed the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' replied Tom `` I 'm generally forward . ''
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 8]: `` Art thou forward in thy learning ?
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 9]: Canst thou tell me Latin for goose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 13]: `` To be sure , '' replied Tom ; `` Brandy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 4]: `` Brandy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 4]: exclaimed the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 12]: `` Nay , child , it is _ anser _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 10]: `` Then I was right , '' replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 9]: `` You had your _ answer _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 7]: `` The boy is apt . ''
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 5]: _ Cluck cluck _ .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 25]: `` He is apt to be devilish saucy , old gentleman ; but never mind that , there 's no harm in him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 15]: `` This , then , is young Tom , I presume , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 8]: said the Dominie , referring to me .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 28]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied I. `` You have seen old Tom , and young Tom , and you have only to see Tommy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 9]: `` Want to see Tommy , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 8]: `` Here , Tommy , Tommy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 30]: But Tommy , who was rather busy with a bone forward , did not immediately answer to his call , and the Dominie turned round to survey the river .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 40]: The scene was busy , barges and boats passing in every direction , others lying on shore , with waggons taking out the coals and other cargoes , men at work , shouting or laughing with each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 13]: ` _ Populus in fluviis _ , ' as Virgil hath it .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 37]: Grand indeed is the vast river , ` _ Labitur et labetur in omne volubilis aevum _ , ' as the generations of men are swept into eternity , '' said the Dominie , musing aloud .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 34]: But Tommy had now made his appearance , and Tom , in his mischief , had laid hold of the tail of the Dominie 's coat , and shown it to the dog .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 29]: The dog , accustomed to seize a rope when it was shown to him , immediately seized the Dominie 's coat , making three desperate tugs at it .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 48]: The Dominie , who was in one of his reveries , and probably thought it was I who wished to direct his attention elsewhere , each time waved his hand , without turning round , as much as to say , `` I am busy now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 26]: `` Haul and hold , '' cried Tom to the dog , splitting his sides , and the tears running down his cheeks with laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 50]: Tommy made one more desperate tug , carrying away one tail of the Dominie 's coat ; but the Dominie perceived it not , he was still '' _ nubibus _ , '' while the dog galloped forward with the fragment , and Tom chased him to recover it .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 56]: The Dominie continued in his reverie , when old Tom burst out -- `` O , England , dear England , bright gem of the ocean , Thy valleys and fields look fertile and gay , The heart clings to thee with a sacred devotion , And memory adores when in far lands away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 30]: The song gradually called the Dominie to his recollection ; indeed , the strain was so beautiful that it would have vibrated in the ears of a dying man .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 46]: The Dominie gradually turned round , and when old Tom had finished , exclaimed , `` Truly it did delight mine ear , and from such -- and , '' continued the Dominie , looking down upon old Tom -- `` without legs too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 21]: `` Why , old gentleman , I do n't sing with my _ legs _ , '' answered old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 53]: `` Nay , good _ Dux _ , I am not so deficient as not to be aware that a man singeth from the mouth ; yet is thy voice mellifluous , sweet as the honey of Hybla , strong -- '' `` As the Latin for goose , '' finished Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 22]: `` Come , father , old _ Dictionary _ is in the doldrums ; rouse him up with another stave . ''
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 19]: `` I 'll rouse you up with the stave of a cask over your shoulders , Mr Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 12]: What have you done with the old gentleman 's swallow-tail ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 21]: `` Leave me to settle that affair , father : I know how to get out of a scrape . ''
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 24]: `` So you ought , you scamp , considering how many you get into ; but the craft are swinging and heaving up .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 21]: Forward there , Jacob , and sway up the mast ; there 's Tom and Tommy to help you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 25]: The mast was hoisted up , the sail set , and the lighter in the stream before the Dominie was out of his reverie .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 7]: `` Are there whirlpools here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 14]: said the Dominie , talking more to himself than to those about him .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 4]: `` Whirlpools ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 22]: replied young Tom , who was watching and mocking him ; `` yes , that there are , under the bridges .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 17]: I 've watched a dozen _ chips _ go down , one after the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 8]: `` A dozen _ ships _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 15]: exclaimed the Dominie , turning to Tom ; `` and every soul lost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 15]: `` Never saw them afterwards , '' replied Tom , in a mournful voice .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 29]: `` How little did I dream of the dangers of those so near me , '' said the Dominie , turning away , and communing with himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 49]: ` Those who go down to the sea in ships , and occupy their business in great waters ; ' -- ` _ Et vastas aperit Syrtes _ ; ' -- ` These men see the works of the Lord , and his wonders in the deep . '
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 11]: -- ` _ Alternante vorans vasta Charybdis aqua _ . '
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 19]: -- ` For at his word the stormy wind ariseth , which lifteth up the waves thereof . '
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 8]: -- ` _ Surgens a puppi ventus .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 10]: -- Ubi tempestas et caeli mobilis humor _ . '
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 18]: -- ` They are carried up to the heavens , and down again to the deep . '
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 12]: -- ` _ Gurgitibus miris et lactis vertice torrens _ . '
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 12]: -- ` Their soul melteth away because of their troubles . '
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 6]: -- ` _ Stant pavidi .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 10]: Omnibus ignoiae mortis timor , omnibus hostem _ . '
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 17]: -- ` They reel to and fro , and stagger like a drunken man . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 14]: `` So they do , father , do n't they , sometimes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 10]: observed Tom , leering his eye at his father .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 12]: `` That 's all I 've understood of his speech . ''
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 14]: `` They are at their wit 's end , '' continued the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 22]: `` Mind the end of your wit , master Tom , '' answered his father , wroth at the insinuation . ''
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 79]: ` So when they call upon the Lord in their trouble ' -- ` _ Cujus jurare timent et fallere nomen _ ' -- ` He delivereth them out of their distress , for he makest the storm to cease , so that the waves thereof are still ; ' yea , still and smooth as the peaceful water which now floweth rapidly by our anchored vessel -- yet it appeareth to me that the scene hath changed .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 8]: These fields met not mine eyes before .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 11]: ` _ Riparumque toros et prata recentia rivis _ . '
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 9]: Surely we have moved from the wharf ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 31]: -- and the Dominie turned round , and discovered , for the first time , that we were more than a mile from the place at which we had embarked .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 15]: `` Pray , sir , what 's the use of speech , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 17]: interrogated Tom , who had been listening to the whole of the Dominie 's long soliloquy .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 9]: `` Thou asketh a foolish question , boy .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 17]: We are endowed with the power of speech to enable us to communicate our ideas . ''
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 10]: `` That 's exactly what I thought , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 21]: Then pray what 's the use of your talking all that gibberish , that none of us could understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 20]: `` I crave thy pardon , child ; I spoke , I presume , in the dead languages . ''
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 16]: `` If they 're dead , why not let them rest in their graves ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 8]: `` Good ; thou hast wit . ''
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 8]: -LRB- _ Cluck , cluck _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 17]: `` Yet , child , know that it is pleasant to commune with the dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 4]: `` Is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 12]: then we 'll put you on shore at Battersea churchyard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 5]: `` Silence , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 15]: He 's full of his sauce , sir -- you must forgive it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 23]: `` Nay , it pleaseth me to hear him talk ; but it would please me more to hear thee sing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 58]: `` Then here goes , sir , to drown Tom 's impudence : -- `` Glide on my bark , the morning tide Is gently floating by thy side ; Around thy prow the waters bright , In circling rounds of broken light , Are glittering , as if ocean gave Her countless gems unto the wave .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 28]: `` That 's a pretty air , and I first heard it sung by a pretty woman ; but that 's all I know of the song .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 17]: She sang another -- `` I 'd be a butterfly , born in a bower . ''
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 8]: `` You 'd be a butterfly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 15]: said the Dominie , taking old Tom literally , and looking at his person .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 27]: Young Tom roared , `` Yes , sir , he 'd be a butterfly , and I do n't see why he should n't very soon .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 32]: His legs are gone , and his wings are n't come : so he 's a grub now , and that , you know , is the next thing to it .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 15]: What a funny old beggar it is , father -- are n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 17]: `` Tom , Tom , go forward , sir ; we must shoot the bridge . ''
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 4]: `` Shoot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 9]: exclaimed the Dominie ; `` shoot what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 14]: `` You are n't afraid of fire-arms , are ye , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 3]: inquired Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 20]: `` Nay , I said not that I was afraid of fire-arms ; but why should you shoot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 20]: `` We never could get on without it , sir ; we shall have plenty of shooting , by-and-by .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 8]: You do n't know this river . ''
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 24]: `` Indeed , I thought not of such doings ; or that there were other dangers besides that of the deep waters . ''
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 20]: `` Go forward , Tom , and do n't be playing with your betters , '' cried old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 14]: `` Never mind him , sir , he 's only humbugging you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 5]: `` Explain , Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 24]: The language of both old Tom and young Tom are to me as incomprehensible as would be that of the dog Tommy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 12]: `` Or as your Latin is to them , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 7]: `` True , Jacob , true .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 26]: I have no right to complain ; nay , I do not complain , for I am amused , although at times much puzzled . ''
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 31]: We now shot Putney Bridge , and as a wherry passed us , old Tom carolled out -- `` Did you ever hear tell of a jolly young waterman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 21]: `` No , I never did , '' said the Dominie , observing old Tom 's eyes directed towards him .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 47]: Tom , amused by this _ naivete _ on the part of the Dominie , touched him by the sleeve , on the other side , and commenced with his treble -- `` Did you ne'er hear a tale Of a maid in the vale ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 15]: `` Not that I can recollect , my child , '' replied the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 12]: `` Then , where have you been all your life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 20]: `` My life has been employed , my lad , in teaching the young idea how to shoot . ''
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 17]: `` So , you 're an old soldier , after all , and afraid of fire-arms .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 8]: Why do n't you hold yourself up ?
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 18]: I suppose it 's that enormous jib of yours that brings you down by the head . ''
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 19]: `` Tom , Tom , I 'll cut you into pork pieces if you go on that gait .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 16]: Go and get dinner under weigh , you scamp , and leave the gentleman alone .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 6]: Here 's more wind coming .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 29]: `` A wet sheet and a flowing sea , A wind that follows fast , And fills the white and rustling sail , And bends the gallant mast .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 31]: And bends the gallant mast , my boys , While , like the eagle free , Away the good ship flies , and leaves Old England on the lee . ''
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 48]: `` Jacob , '' said the Dominie , `` I have heard by the mouth of Rumour , with her hundred tongues , how careless and indifferent are sailors unto danger ; but I never could have believed that such lightness of heart could have been shown .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 16]: Yon man , although certainly not old in years , yet , what is he ?
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 13]: -- a remnant of a man resting upon unnatural and ill-proportioned support .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 28]: Yon lad , who is yet but a child , appears as blythe and merry as if he were in possession of all the world can afford .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 26]: I have an affection for that bold child , and would fain teach him the rudiments , at least , of the Latin tongue . ''
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 12]: `` I doubt if Tom would ever learn them , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 9]: He hath a will of his own . ''
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 32]: `` It grieveth me to hear thee say so , for he lacketh not talent , but instruction ; and the Dux , he pleaseth me mightily -- a second Palinurus .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 49]: Yet how that a man could venture to embark upon an element , to struggle through the horrors of which must occasionally demand the utmost exertion of every limb , with the want of the two most necessary for his safety , is to me quite incomprehensible . ''
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 10]: `` He can keep his legs , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 18]: `` Nay , Jacob ; how can he _ keep _ what are _ already gone _ ?
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 8]: Even thou speakest strangely upon the water .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 57]: I see the dangers that surround us , Jacob , yet I am calm : I feel that I have not lived a wicked life -- ` _ Integer vitae , scelerisque purus _ , ' as Horace truly saith , may venture , even as I have done , upon the broad expanse of water .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 11]: What is it that the boy is providing for us ?
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 7]: It hath an inviting smell . ''
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 18]: `` Lobscouse , master , '' replied old Tom , `` and not bad lining either . ''
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 15]: `` I recollect no such word -- _ unde derivatur _ , friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 8]: `` What 's that , master ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 4]: inquired old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 30]: `` It 's Latin for lobscouse , depend upon it , father , '' cried Tom , who was stirring up the savoury mess with a large wooden spoon .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 16]: `` He be a _ deadly _ lively old gentleman , with his dead language .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 5]: Dinner 's all ready .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 15]: Are we to let go the anchor , or pipe to dinner first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 9]: `` We may as well anchor , boys .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 20]: We have not a quarter of an hour 's more ebb , and the wind is heading us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 20]: Tom and I went forward , brailed up the mainsail , cleared away , and let go the anchor .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 9]: The lighter swung round rapidly to the stream .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 54]: The Dominie , who had been in a fit of musing , with his eyes cast upon the forests of masts which we had passed below London Bridge , and which were now some way astern of us , of a sudden exclaimed , in a loud voice , '' _ Parce precor !
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 5]: Periculosum est _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 38]: The lighter , swinging short round to her anchor , had surprised the Dominie with the rapid motion of the panorama , and he thought we had fallen in with one of the whirlpools mentioned by Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 8]: `` What has happened , good Dux ?
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 17]: tell me , '' cried the Dominie to old Tom , with alarm in his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 64]: `` Why , master , I 'll tell you after my own fashion , '' replied old Tom , smiling ; and then singing , as he held the Dominie by the button of his spencer -- `` Now to her berth the craft draws nigh , With slacken 'd sail , she feels the tide ; ` Stand clear the cable ! '
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 13]: is the cry -- The anchor 's gone , we safely ride .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 13]: `` And now , master , we 'll bail out the lobscouse .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 29]: We sha 'n' t weigh anchor again until to-morrow morning ; the wind 's right in our teeth , and it will blow fresh , I 'm sartain .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 34]: Look how the scud 's flying ; so now we 'll have a jolly time of it , and you shall have your allowance of grog on board before you turn in . ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 31]: `` I have before heard of that potation , '' replied the Dominie , sitting down on the coaming of the hatchway , `` and fain would taste it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWELVE .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 38]: IS A CHAPTER OF TALES IN A DOUBLE SENSE -- THE DOMINIE , FROM THE NATURAL EFFECTS OF HIS SINGLE-HEARTEDNESS , BEGINS TO SEE DOUBLE -- A NEW DEFINITION OF PHILOSOPHY , WITH AN EPISODE ON JEALOUSY .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 33]: We now took our seats on the deck , round the saucepan , for we did not trouble ourselves with dishes , and the Dominie appeared to enjoy the lobscouse very much .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 102]: In the course of half-an-hour all was over ; that is to say , we had eaten as much as we wished ; and the Newfoundland dog , who , during our repast , lay close by young Tom , flapping the deck with his tail , and sniffing the savoury smell of the compound , had just licked all our plates quite clean , and was now finishing with his head in the saucepan ; while Tom was busy carrying the crockery into the cabin , and bringing out the bottle and tin pannikins , ready for the promised carouse .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 22]: `` There , now , master , there 's a glass o ' grog for you that would float a marline-spike .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 16]: See if that do n't warm the _ cockles _ of your old heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 22]: `` Ay , '' added Tom , `` and set all your _ muscles _ as taut as weather backstays . ''
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 17]: `` Master Tom , with your leave , I 'll mix your grog for you myself .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 10]: Hand me back that bottle , you rascal . ''
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 28]: `` Just as you please , father , '' replied Tom , handing the bottle ; `` but recollect , none of your _ water bewitched _ .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 9]: Only help me as you love me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 15]: Old Tom mixed a pannikin of grog for Tom , and another for himself .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 14]: I hardly need say which was the _ stiffer _ of the two .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 15]: `` Well , father , I suppose you think the grog will run short .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 17]: To be sure , one bottle are n't too much ` mong four of us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 7]: `` One bottle , you scamp !
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 8]: there 's another in the cupboard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 11]: `` Then you must see double already , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 41]: Old Tom , who was startled at this news , and who imagined that Tom must have gained possession of the other bottle , jumped up and made for the cupboard , to ascertain whether what Tom asserted was correct .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 20]: This was what Tom wished ; he immediately changed pannikins of grog with his father , and remained quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 23]: `` There _ is _ another bottle , Tom , '' said his father , coming out and taking his seat again .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 6]: `` I knew there was .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 14]: You young rascal , you do n't know how you frightened me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 10]: And old Tom put the pannikin to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 9]: `` Drowned the miller , by heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 12]: said he , `` What could I have been about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 10]: ejaculated he , adding more spirit to his mixture .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 23]: `` I suppose , upon the strength of another bottle in the locker , you are doubling the strength of your grog .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 35]: Come , father , '' and Tom held out his pannikin , `` do put a little drop in mine -- it 's seven-water grog , and I 'm not on the black-list . ''
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 13]: `` No , no , Tom ; your next shall be stronger .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 12]: Well , master , how do you like your liquor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 17]: `` Verily , '' replied the Dominie , `` it is a pleasant and seducing liquor .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 4]: Lo and behold !
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 10]: I am at the bottom of my utensil . ''
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 12]: `` Stop till I fill it up again , old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 10]: I see you are one of the right sort .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 45]: You know what the song says -- `` A plague on those musty old lubbers , Who tell us to fast and to think , And patient fall in with life 's rubbers , With nothing but _ water _ to _ drink _ !
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 5]: `` Water , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 23]: The only use of water I know is to mix your grog with , and float vessels up and down the world .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 16]: Why was the sea made salt , but to prevent our drinking too much water .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 4]: Water , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 52]: `` A can of good grog , had they swigg 'd it , T'would have set them for pleasure agog , And in spite of the rules Of the schools , The old fools Would have all of them swigg 'd it , And swore there was nothing like grog . ''
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 20]: `` I 'm exactly of your opinion , father , '' said Tom , holding out his empty pannikin .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 28]: `` Always ready for two things , Master Tom -- grog and mischief ; but , however , you shall have one more _ dose _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 10]: `` It hath , then , medicinal virtues ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 4]: inquired the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 19]: `` Ay , that it has , master -- more than all the quacking medicines in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 14]: It cures grief and melancholy , and prevents spirits from getting low . ''
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 33]: `` I doubt that , father , '' cried Tom , holding up the bottle `` for the more grog we drink , the more the _ spirits become low _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 14]: _ Cluck , cluck _ , came from the thorax of the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 18]: `` Verily , friend Tom , it appeareth , among other virtues , to sharpen the wits .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 13]: Proceed , friend Dux , in the medicinal virtues of grog . ''
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 22]: `` Well , master , it cures love when it 's not returned , and adds to it when it is .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 17]: I 've heard say it will cure jealousy ; but that I 've my doubts of .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 22]: Now I think on it , I will tell you a yarn about a jealous match between a couple of fools .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 12]: Jacob , are n't your pannikin empty , my boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' replied I , handing it up to be filled .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 29]: It was empty , for , not being very fond of it myself , Tom , with my permission , had drunk it as well as his own .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 24]: `` There , Jacob , is a good dose for you ; you are n't always craving after it , like Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 16]: `` He is n't troubled with low spirits , as I am , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 12]: `` How long has that been your complaint , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 12]: inquired I. `` Ever since I heard how to cure it .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 10]: Come , father , give us the yarn . ''
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 71]: `` Well , then , you must mind that an old shipmate o ' mine , Ben Leader , had a wife named Poll , a pretty sort of craft in her way -- neat in her rigging , swelling-bows , taking sort of figure-head , and devilish well rounded in the counter ; altogether , she was a very fancy girl , and all the men were after her .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 25]: She 'd a roguish eye , and liked to be stared at , as most pretty women do , because it flatters their vanities .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 38]: Now , although she liked to be noticed so far by the other chaps , yet Ben was the only one she ever wished to be handled by ; it was ` Paws off , Pompey ! '
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 5]: with all the rest .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 65]: Ben Leader was a good-looking , active , smart chap , and could foot it in a reel , or take a bout at single-stick with the very best o ' them ; and she was mortal fond of him , and mortal jealous if he talked to any other woman , for the women liked Ben as much as the men liked she .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 37]: Well , as they returned love for love , so did they return jealousy for jealousy ; and the lads and lasses , seeing that , had a pleasure in making them come to a misunderstanding .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 11]: So every day it became worse and worse between them .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 52]: Now , I always says that it 's a stupid thing to be jealous , _ 'cause _ if there be _ cause _ , there be no _ cause _ for love and if there be no _ cause _ , there be no _ cause _ for jealousy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 22]: `` You 're like a row in a rookery , father -- nothing but _ caws _ , '' interrupted Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 24]: `` Well , I suppose I am ; but that 's what I call chop logic -- are n't it , master ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 18]: `` It was a syllogism , '' replied the Dominie , taking the pannikin from his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 32]: `` I do n't know what that is , nor do I want to know , '' replied old Tom ; `` so I 'll just go on with my story .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 10]: Well , at last they came to downright fighting .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 40]: Ben licks Poll 'cause she talked and laughed with other men , and Poll cries and whines all day 'cause he wo n't sit on her knee , instead of going on board and ` tending to his duty .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 46]: Well , one night , a ` ter work was over , Ben goes on shore to the house where he and Poll used to sleep ; and when he sees the girl in the bar , he says , ` Where is Poll ? '
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 19]: Now , the girl at the bar was a fresh-comer , and answers , ` What girl ? '
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 47]: So Ben describes her , and the bar-girl answers , ` She be just gone to bed with her husband , I suppose ; ' for , you see , there was a woman like her who had gone up to her bed , sure enough .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 37]: When Ben heard that , he gave his trousers one hitch , and calls for a quartern , drinks it off with a sigh , and leaves the house , believing it all to be true .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 36]: A'ter Ben was gone , Poll makes her appearance , and when she finds Ben was n't in the tap , says , ` Young woman , did a man go upstairs just now ? '
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 27]: ` Yes , ' replied the bar-girl , ` with his wife , I suppose ; they be turned in this quarter of an hour . '
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 42]: When she almost turned mad with rage , and then as white as a sheet , and then she burst into tears , and runs out of the house , crying out , ` Poor misfortunate creature that I am ! '
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 20]: knocking everything down undersized , and running into the arms of every man who came athwart her hawse . ''
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 26]: `` I understood him , but just now , that she was running on foot ; yet doth he talk about her _ horse _ .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 5]: Expound , Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 12]: `` It was a nautical figure of speech , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 35]: `` Exactly , '' rejoined Tom ; `` it meant her figure-head , old gentleman ; but my yarn wo n't cut a figure if I 'm brought up all standing in this way .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 18]: Suppose , master , you hear the story first , and understand it a ` terwards ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 15]: `` I will endeavour to comprehend by the context , '' replied the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 18]: `` That is , I suppose , that you 'll allow me to stick to my text .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 10]: Well , then , here 's coil away again .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 65]: Ben , you see , what with his jealousy and what with a whole quartern at a draught , became _ somehow nohow _ , and he walked down to the jetty with the intention of getting rid of himself , and his wife and all his trouble by giving his soul back to his Creator , and his body to the fishes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 9]: `` Bad philosophy , '' quoth the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 13]: `` I agree with you , master , '' replied old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 11]: `` Pray what sort of a thing is philosophy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 3]: inquired Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 32]: `` Philosophy , '' replied old Tom , `` is either hanging , drowning , shooting yourself , or , in short , getting out of the world without help . ''
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 18]: `` Nay , '' replied the Dominie , `` that is _ felo de se _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 26]: `` Well , I pronounce it quicker than you , master ; but it 's one and the same thing : but to go on .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 56]: While Ben was standing on the jetty , thinking whether he should take one more quid of ` baccy afore he dived , who should come down but Poll , with her hair all adrift , streaming and coach-whipping astern of her , with the same intention as Ben -- to commit _ philo-zoffy _ .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 60]: Ben , who was standing at the edge of the jetty , his eyes fixed upon the water , as it eddied among the piles , looking as dismal as if he had swallowed a hearse and six , with the funeral feathers hanging out of his mouth -- '' `` A bold comparison , '' murmured the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 33]: `` Never sees her ; and she was so busy with herself , that , although close to him , she never sees he -- always remembering that the night was dark .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 17]: So Poll turned her eyes up , for all the world like a dying jackdaw . ''
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 23]: `` Tell me , friend Dux , '' interrupted the Dominie , `` doth a jackdaw die in any peculiar way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 17]: `` Yes , '' replied young Tom ; `` he always dies black , master . ''
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 9]: `` Then doth he die as he liveth .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 8]: -LRB- _ Cluck , cluck _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 6]: Proceed , good Dux . ''
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 26]: `` And do n't you break the thread of my yarn any more , master , if you wish to hear the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 8]: So Poll begins to bludder about Ben .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 35]: ` O Ben , Ben , ' cried she ; ` cruel , cruel man ; for to come -- for to go ; -- for to go -- for to come ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 6]: ` Who 's there ? '
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 4]: shouted Ben . ''
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 14]: ` For to come -- for to go , ' cried Poll . ''
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 5]: ` Ship ahoy ! '
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 6]: hailed Ben , again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 25]: ` For to go -- for to come , ' blubbered Poll ; and then she could n't bring out anything more for sobbing .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 29]: With that , Ben , who thought he knew the voice , walks up to her , and says , ` Be that you , Poll ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 8]: ` Be that you , Ben ? '
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 16]: replied Poll , taking her hands from her face , and looking at him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 13]: ` I thought you were in bed with -- with -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 3]: Poll ! '
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 4]: said Ben . ''
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 12]: ` And I thought you were in bed with -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 3]: Ben ! '
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 4]: replied Poll . ''
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 10]: ` But I was n't , Poll ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 11]: ` Nor more was n't I , Ben . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 11]: ` And what brought you here , Poll ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 9]: ` I wanted for to die , Ben .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 10]: And what brought you here , Ben ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 18]: ` I did n't want for to live , Poll , when I thought you false . '
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 28]: `` Then Polly might have answered in the words of the old song , master ; but her poor heart was too full , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 25]: And Tom sang -- `` Your Polly has never been false , she declares , Since last time we parted at Wapping Old Stairs .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 96]: `` Howsomever , in the next minute they were both hugging and kissing , sobbing , shivering and shaking in each other 's arms ; and as soon as they had settled themselves a little , back they went , arm-in-arm , to the house , and had a good stiff glass to prevent their taking the rheumatism , went to bed , and were cured of their jealously ever a ` terwards -- which in my opinion , was a much better _ philo-zoffy _ than the one they had both been bound on .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 23]: There , I 've wound it all off at last , master , and now we 'll fill up our pannikins . ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 33]: `` Before I consent , friend Dux , pr ` ythee inform me how much of this pleasant liquor may be taken without inebriating , _ vulgo _ , getting tipsy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 23]: `` Father can drink enough to float a jolly-boat , master , '' replied Tom ; `` so you need n't fear .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 13]: I 'll drink pan for pan with you all night long . ''
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 14]: `` Indeed you wo n't , mister Tom , '' replied the father .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 8]: `` But I will , master . ''
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 27]: I perceived that the liquor had already had some effect upon my worthy pedagogue , and was not willing that he should be persuaded into excess .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 26]: I therefore pulled him by the coat as a hint ; but he was again deep in thought , and he did not heed me .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 19]: Tired of sitting so long , I got up , and walked forward to look at the cable .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 19]: `` Strange , '' muttered the Dominie , `` that Jacob should thus pull me by the garment .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 6]: What could he mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 9]: `` Did he pull you , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 3]: inquired Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 13]: `` Yes , many times ; and then he walked away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 43]: `` It appears that you have been pulled too much , sir , '' replied Tom , appearing to pick up the tail of his coat , which had been torn off by the dog , and handing it to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 3]: _ Eheu !
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 10]: Jacobe -- fili dilectissime -- quid fecisti _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 18]: cried the Dominie , holding up the fragment of his coat with a look of despair . ''
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 41]: ` A long pull , a strong pull , and a pull altogether , ' '' sang out old Tom : and then looking at Tom , `` Now , ai n't you a pretty rascal , master Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 31]: `` It is done , '' exclaimed the Dominie , with a sigh , putting the fragment into the remaining pocket ; `` and it can not be undone . ''
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 20]: `` Now , I think it is undone , and can be done , master , '' replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 31]: `` A needle and thread will soon join the pieces of your old coat again -- in _ holy _ matrimony , I may safely say -- '' `` True .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 8]: -LRB- _ Cluck , cluck _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 49]: My housekeeper will restore it ; yet will she be wroth , ` _ Feminae curaeque iraeque _ ; ' but let us think no more about it , '' cried the Dominie , drinking deeply from his pannikin , and each minute verging fast to intoxication . ''
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 14]: ` _ Nunc est bibendum , nunc pede libero pulsanda tellus _ . '
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 24]: I feel as if I were lifted up , and could dance , yea , and could exalt my voice and sing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 9]: `` Could you , my jolly old master ?
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 35]: then we will both dance and sing -- `` Come , let us dance and sing , While all Barbadoes bells shall ring , Mars scrapes the fiddle string While Venus plays the lute .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 12]: Hymen gay , trips away , Jocund at the wedding day .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 15]: `` Now for chorus -- `` Come , let us dance and sing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 49]: THE `` FUN GROWS FAST AND FURIOUS '' -- THE PEDAGOGUE DOES NOT SCAN CORRECTLY , AND HIS FEET BECOME VERY UNEQUAL -- AN ALLEGORICAL COMPLIMENT ALMOST WORKED UP INTO A LITERAL QUARREL -- AT LENGTH THE MIGHTY ARE LAID LOW , AND THE DOMINIE HURTS HIS NOSE .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 59]: I heard Tom 's treble , and a creaking noise , which I recognised to proceed from the Dominie , who had joined the chorus ; and I went aft , if possible to prevent further excess ; but I found that the grog had mounted into the Dominie 's head , and all my hints were disregarded .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 61]: Tom was despatched for the other bottle , and the Dominie 's pannikin was replenished , old Tom roaring out -- `` Come , sling the flowing bowl ; Fond hopes arise , The girls we prize Shall bless each jovial soul ; The can , boys , bring , We 'll dance and sing , While foaming billows roll .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 17]: `` Now for the chorus again -- `` Come , sling the flowing bowl , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 10]: `` Jacob , why do n't you join ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 10]: The chorus was given by the whole of us .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 20]: The Dominie 's voice was even louder , though not quite so musical , as old Tom 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 5]: _ Evoe _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 8]: cried the Dominie ; '' _ evoe !
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 4]: cantemus _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 35]: _ Amo , amas _ -- I loved a lass , For she was tall and slender ; _ Amas , amat _ -- she laid me flat , Though of the feminine gender .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 47]: `` Truly do I not forget the songs of my youth , and of my hilarious days : yet doth the potent spirit work upon me like the god in the Cumean sybil ; and I shall soon prophecy that which shall come to pass . ''
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 17]: `` So can I , '' said Tom , giving me a nudge , and laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 22]: `` Do thine office of Ganymede , and fill up the pannikin ; put not in too much of the element .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 10]: Once more exalt thy voice , good Dux . ''
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 57]: `` Always ready , master , '' cried Tom , who sang out again in praise of his favourite liquor -- `` Smiling grog is the sailor 's best hope , his sheet anchor , His compass , his cable , his log , That gives him a heart which life 's cares can not canker .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 20]: Though dangers around him , Unite to confound him , He braves them , and tips off his grog .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 29]: 'T is grog , only grog , Is his rudder , his compass , his cable , his log , The sailor 's sheet anchor is grog . ''
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 33]: `` Verily , thou art an Apollo -- or , rather , referring to thy want of legs , half an Apollo -- that is , a _ demi _ - god .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 8]: -LRB- _ Cluck , cluck _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 9]: Sweet is thy lyre , friend Dux . ''
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 15]: `` Fair words , master ; I 'm no liar , '' cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 17]: `` Clap a stopper on your tongue , or you 'll get into disgrace . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 29]: _ Ubi lapsus quid feci _ , '' said the Dominie ; `` I spoke of thy musical tongue ; and , furthermore , I spoke alle-gori-cal-ly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 58]: `` I know a man lies with his tongue as well as you do , old chap ; but as for telling a _ hell of a _ -LRB- something -RRB- _ lie _ , as you states , I say I never did , '' rejoined old Tom , who was getting cross in his cups .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 54]: I now interfered , as there was every appearance of a fray ; and in spite of young Tom , who wished , as he termed it , to _ kick up a shindy _ , prevailed upon them to make friends , which they did , shaking hands for nearly five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 23]: When this was ended , I again entreated the Dominie not to drink any more , but to go to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 30]: _ Amice , Jacobe _ , '' replied the Dominie ; `` the liquor hath mounted into thy brain , and thou wouldst rebuke thy master and thy preceptor .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 15]: Betake thee to thy couch , and sleep off the effects of thy drink .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 22]: Verily , Jacob , thou art _ plenus Veteris Bacchi _ ; or , in plain English , thou art drunk .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 6]: Canst thou conjugate , Jacob ?
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 4]: I fear not .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 6]: Canst thou decline , Jacob ?
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 4]: I fear not .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 6]: Canst thou scan , Jacob ?
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 4]: I fear not .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 21]: Nay , Jacob , methinks that thou art unsteady in thy gait , and not over clear in thy vision .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 6]: Canst thou hear , Jacob ?
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 21]: if so , I will give thee an oration against inebriety , with which thou mayest down on thy pillow .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 11]: Wilt thou have it in Latin or in Greek ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 10]: `` O , damn your Greek and Latin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 10]: cried old Tom ; `` keep that for to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 16]: Sing us a song , my old hearty ; or shall I sing you one ?
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 42]: Here goes -- `` For while the grog goes round , All sense of danger 's drown 'd , We despise it to a man ; We sing a little -- '' `` Sing a little , '' bawled the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 17]: `` And laugh a little -- '' `` Laugh a little , '' chorused young Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 17]: `` And work a little -- '' `` Work a little , '' cried the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 19]: `` And swear a little -- '' `` Swear _ not _ a little , '' echoed Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 17]: `` And fiddle a little -- '' `` Fiddle a little , '' hiccuped the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 18]: `` And foot it a little -- '' `` Foot it a little , '' repeated Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 33]: `` And swig the flowing can , And fiddle a little , And foot it a little , And swig the flowing can -- '' roared old Tom , emptying his pannikin .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 16]: `` And swig the flowing can -- '' followed the Dominie , tossing off his .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 17]: `` And swig the flowing can -- '' cried young Tom turning up his pannikin empty .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 3]: `` Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 7]: that 's what I calls glorious .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 15]: Let 's have it over again , and then we 'll have another dose .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 8]: Come , now , all together . ''
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 110]: Again was the song repeated ; and when they came to `` foot it a little , '' old Tom jumped on his stumps , seizing hold of the Dominie , who immediately rose , and the three danced round and round for a minute or two , singing the song and chorus , till old Tom , who was very far gone , tripped against the coamings of the hatchway , pitching his head into the Dominie 's stomach , who fell backwards , clinging to young Tom 's hand ; so that they all rolled on the deck together -- my worthy preceptor underneath the other two .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 26]: `` Foot it _ rather too much _ that time , father , '' said young Tom , getting up the first , and laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 23]: `` Come , Jacob , let 's put father on his pins again ; he ca n't rise without a purchase . ''
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 7]: With some difficulty , we succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 59]: As soon as he was on his legs again , old Tom put a hand upon each of our shoulders , and commenced , with a drunken leer -- `` What though his timbers they are gone , And he 's a slave to tipple , No better sailor e'er was born Than Tom , the jovial cripple .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 15]: `` Thanky , my boys , thanky ; now rouse up the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 10]: I suspect we knocked the wind out of him .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 11]: Hollo , there , are you hard and fast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 30]: `` The bricks are hard , and verily my senses are fast departing , '' quoth the Dominie , rousing himself , and sitting up , staring around him .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 11]: `` Senses going , do you say , master ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 4]: cried old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 13]: `` Do n't throw them overboard till we have made a finish .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 14]: One more pannikin apiece , one more song , and then to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 8]: Tom , where 's the bottle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 24]: `` Drink no more , sir , I beg ; you 'll be ill to-morrow , '' said I to the Dominie . ''

Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 30]: _ Propria quae maribus _ had a little dog , _ Quae genus _ was his name -- `` My memory faileth me -- what was the tune ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 20]: `` That tune was the one the old cow died of , I 'm sure , '' replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 11]: `` Come , old Nosey , strike up again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 34]: `` Nosey , from _ nasus _ -- truly , it is a fair epithet ; and it remindeth me that my nose -- suffered in the fall which I received just now .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 65]: Yet I can not sing -- having no words -- '' `` Nor tune , either , master , '' replied old Tom ; `` so here goes for you -- `` Young Susan had lovers , so many that she Hardly knew upon which to decide ; They all spoke sincerely , and promised to be All worthy of such a sweet bride .

Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 6]: Let me see -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 77]: `` Now William grew jealous , and so went away ; Harry got tired of wooing ; And Tom having teased her to fix on the day , Received but a frown for so doing ; So , ` mongst all her lovers , quite left in the lurch , She pined every night on her pillow ; And meeting one day a pair going to church , Turned away , and died under a willow .

Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 47]: Tom then struck up , the Dominie see-sawing as he sat , and getting very sleepy -- `` Luck in life , or good or bad , Ne'er could make me melancholy ; Seldom rich , yet never sad , Sometimes poor , yet always jolly .

Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 10]: `` Now for chorus , father -- `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 7]: I could never cry for laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 23]: `` That 's all I know ; and that 's enough , for it wo n't wake up the old gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 4]: But it did .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 13]: `` Ha , ha , ha -- ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 25]: I could never die for laughing , '' bawled out the Dominie , feeling for his pannikin ; but this was his last effort .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 5]: He stared round him .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 18]: `` Verily , verily , we are in a whirlpool -- how everything turneth round and round !
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 3]: Who cares ?
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 20]: Am I not an ancient mariner -- ` _ Qui videt mare turgidum -- et infames scopulos _ . '
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 13]: Friend Dux , listen to me -- _ favet linguis _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 24]: `` Well , '' hiccuped old Tom , `` so I will -- but speak -- plain English -- as I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 16]: `` That I 'll be hanged if he does , '' said Tom to me .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 28]: `` In half an hour more I shall understand old Nosey 's Latin just as well as his -- plain English , as he calls it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 47]: `` I will discuss in any language -- that is -- in any tongue -- be it in the Greek or the Latin -- nay , even -- -LRB- hiccups -RRB- -- friend Dux -- hast thou not partaken too freely -- of -- dear me !
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 39]: _ Quo me , Bacche , rapis tui -- plenum _ -- truly I shall be tipsy -- and will but finish my pattypan -- _ dulce periculum est _ -- Jacob -- can there be two Jacobs ?
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 6]: -- and two old Toms ?
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 25]: -- nay -- _ mirabile dictu _ -- there are two young Toms , and two dog Tommies -- each with -- two tails .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 16]: _ Bacche , parce -- precor -- precor _ -- Jacob , where art thou ?
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 22]: -- _ Ego sum tu es _ -- thou art -- _ sumus _ , we are -- where am I ?
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 23]: _ Procumbit humi bos _ -- for Bos -- read Dobbs -- _ amo , amas _ -- I loved a lass .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 30]: _ Tityre , tu patulae sub teg-mine _ -- nay -- I quote wrong -- then must I be -- I do believe that -- I 'm drunk . ''
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 26]: `` And I 'm cock sure of it , '' cried Tom , laughing , as the Dominie fell back in a state of insensibility .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 56]: `` And I 'm cock sure of it , '' said old Tom , rolling himself along the deck to the cabin hatch `` that I 've as much -- as I can stagger -- under , at all events -- so I 'll sing myself to sleep -- 'cause why -- I 'm happy .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 18]: Jacob -- mind you keep all the watches to-night -- and Tom may keep the rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 48]: Old Tom then sat up , leaning his back against the cabin hatch , and commenced one of those doleful ditties which are sometimes heard on the forecastle of a man-of-war ; he had one or two of the songs that he always reserved for such occasions .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 20]: While Tom and I dragged the Dominie to bed , old Tom drawled out his ditty -- `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 41]: we sailed to Virgi-ni-a , and thence to Fy-al , Where we water 'd our shipping , and so then weigh-ed all , Full in view , on the seas -- boys -- seven sail we did es-py , O !
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 9]: we man-ned our capstern , and weighed spee-di-ly .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 28]: `` That 's right , my boys , haul and hold -- stow the old Dictionary away -- for he ca n't command the parts of speech .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 20]: `` The very next morning -- the engagement proved -- hot , And brave Admiral Benbow received a chain-shot .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 30]: O when he was wounded to his merry men -- he -- did -- say , Take me up in your arms , boys , and car-ry me a-way .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 28]: `` Now , boys , come and help me -- Tom -- none of your foolery -- for your poor old father is -- drunk -- . ''
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 14]: We assisted old Tom into the other `` bed-place '' in the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 84]: `` Thanky , lads -- one little bit more , and then I 'm done -- as the auctioneer says -- going -- going -- `` O the guns they did rattle , and the bul-lets -- did -- fly , When brave Benbow -- for help loud -- did cry , Carry me down to the cock-pit -- there is ease for my smarts , If my merry men should see me -- ` twill sure -- break -- their -- hearts .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 16]: `` Going , -- old swan-hopper -- as I am -- going -- gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 8]: Tom and I were left on deck .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 14]: `` Now , Jacob , if you have a mind to turn in .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 13]: I 'm not sleepy -- you shall keep the morning watch . ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 11]: `` No , Tom , you 'd better sleep first .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 8]: I 'll call you at four o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 19]: We ca n't weigh till tide serves ; and I shall have plenty of sleep before that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 36]: Tom went to bed , and I walked the deck till the morning , thinking over the events of the day , and wondering what the Dominie would say when he came to his senses .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 50]: At four o'clock , as agreed , I roused Tom out , and turned into his bed , and was soon as fast asleep as old Tom and the Dominie , whose responsive snores had rung in my ears during the whole time that I had walked the deck .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOURTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 48]: COLD WATER AND REPENTANCE -- THE TWO TOMS ALMOST MORAL , AND MYSELF FULL OF WISE REFLECTIONS -- THE CHAPTER , BEING FULL OF GRAVE SAWS , IS LUCKILY VERY SHORT ; AND THOUGH A VERY SENSIBLE ONE , I WOULD NOT ADVISE IT TO BE SKIPPED .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 22]: About half-past eight the next morning , I was called up by Tom to assist in getting the lighter under weigh .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 42]: When on deck I found old Tom as fresh as if he had not drunk a drop the night before , very busily stumping about the windlass , with which we hove up first the anchor , and then the mast .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 12]: `` Well , Jacob , my boy , had sleep enough ?
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 41]: Not too much , I dare say ; but a bout like last night do n't come often , Jacob -- only once in a way ; now , and then I do believe it 's good for my health .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 35]: It 's a great comfort to me , my lad , to have you on board with me , because as you never drinks , I may now indulge a _ little _ oftener .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 36]: As for Tom , I ca n't trust him -- too much like his father -- had nobody to trust to for the look-out , except the dog Tommy , till you came with us .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 40]: I can trust Tommy as far as keeping off the river sharks ; he 'll never let them take a rope-yarn off the deck , night or day ; but a dog 's but a dog , after all .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 23]: Now we 're brought to ; so clap on , my boy , and let 's heave up with a will . ''
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 10]: `` How 's the old gentleman , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 15]: said Tom , as we paused a moment from our labour at the windlass .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 12]: he 's got a good deal more to sleep off yet .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 16]: There he lies , flat on his back , blowing as hard as a grampus .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 9]: Better leave him as long as we can .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 12]: We 'll rouse him as soon as we turn Greenwich reach .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 14]: Tom , did n't you think his nose loomed devilish large yesterday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 16]: `` Never seed such a devil of a cutwater in my life , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 25]: `` Well , then , you 'll see a larger when he gets up , for it 's swelled bigger than the brandy bottle .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 4]: Heave and haul !
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 24]: Now bring to the fall , and up with the mast , boys , while I goes aft and takes the helm . ''
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 5]: Old Tom went aft .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 44]: During the night the wind had veered to the north , and the frost had set in sharp , the rime covered the deck of the barge , and here and there floating ice was to be seen coming down with the tide .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 33]: The banks of the river and fields adjacent were white with hoar frost , and would have presented but a cheerless aspect , had not the sun shone out clear and bright .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 18]: Tom went aft to light the fire , while I coiled away and made all snug forward .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 10]: Old Tom as usual carolled forth -- `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 58]: for a soft and gentle wind , I heard a fair one cry But give to me the roaring breeze , And white waves beating high , And white waves beating high , my boys , The good ship tight and free , The world of waters is our own , And merry men are we . ''
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 15]: `` A nice morning this for cooling a hot head , that 's sartain .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 52]: Tommy , you rascal , you 're like a court lady , with her velvet _ gownd _ , covered all over with diamonds , '' continued old Tom , looking at the Newfoundland dog , whose glossy black hair was besprinkled with little icicles , which glittered in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 22]: `` You and Jacob were the only sensible ones of the party last night , for you both were sober . ''
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 7]: `` So was I , father .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 19]: I was as sober as a judge , '' observed Tom , who was blowing up the fire .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 42]: `` May be , Tom , as a judge a ` ter dinner ; but a judge on the bench be one thing , and a judge over a bottle be another , and not bad judges in that way either .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 20]: At all events , if you war n't _ sewed up _ , it was n't your fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 20]: `` And I suppose , '' replied Tom , `` it was only your misfortune that you were . ''
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 51]: `` No , I do n't say that ; but still , when I look at the dog , who 's but a beast by nature , and thinks of myself , who was n't meant to be a beast , why , I blushes , that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 14]: `` Jacob , look at father -- now , does he blush ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 16]: `` I ca n't say that I perceive it , '' replied I , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 19]: `` Well , then , if I do n't it 's the fault of my having no legs .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 26]: I 'm sure when they were knocked off I lost half the blood in my body , and that 's the reason , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 20]: At all events , I meant to blush , so we 'll take the will for the deed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 14]: `` But do you mean to keep sober in future , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 15]: `` Never do you mind that -- mind your own business , Mr Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 34]: At all events , I sha 'n' t get tipsy till next time , and that 's all I can say with safety , 'cause , d'ye see , I knows my failing .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 18]: Jacob , did you ever see that old gentleman sail too close to the wind before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 19]: `` I never did -- I do not think that he was ever tipsy before last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 13]: `` Then I pities him -- his headache , and his repentance .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 17]: Moreover , there be his nose and the swallow-tail of his coat to make him unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 11]: We shall be down abreast of the Hospital in half-an-hour .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 11]: Suppose you go and give him a shake , Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 33]: Not you , Tom ; I wo n't trust you -- you 'll be doing him a mischief ; you have n't got no fellow-feeling , not even for dumb brutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 20]: `` I 'll thank you not to take away my character that way , father , '' replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 16]: `` Did n't I put you to bed last night when you were speechless ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 9]: `` Suppose you did -- what then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 14]: `` Why , then , I had a feeling for a dumb brute .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 31]: I only say that , father , for the joke of it , you know , '' continued Tom , going up to his father and patting his rough cheek .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 39]: `` I know that , my boy ; you never were unkind , that 's sartain ; but you must have your joke -- `` Merry thoughts are link 'd with laughter , Why should we bury them ?
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 13]: Sighs and tears may come hereafter , No need to hurry them .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 30]: They who through a spying-glass , View the minutes as they pass , Make the sun a gloomy mass , But the fault 's their own , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 12]: In the meantime I was vainly attempting to rouse the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 25]: After many fruitless attempts , I put a large quantity off snuff on his upper lip , and then blew it up his nose .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 5]: But , merciful powers !
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 20]: what a nose it had become -- larger than the largest pear that I ever saw in my life .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 45]: The whole weight of old Tom had fallen on it , and instead of being crushed by the blow , it appeared as if , on the contrary , it had swelled up , indignant at the injury and affront which it had received .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 29]: The skin was as tight as the parchment of a drum , and shining as if it had been oiled , while the colour was a bright purple .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 12]: Verily , it was the Dominie 's nose in a rage .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 13]: The snuff had the effect of partially awakening him from his lethargy .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 11]: `` Six o'clock -- did you say , Mrs Bately ?
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 10]: Are the boys washed -- and in the schoolroom ?
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 13]: I will rise speedily -- yet I am overcome with much heaviness .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 13]: _ Delapsus somnus _ ab -- '' and the Dominie snored again .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 9]: I renewed my attempts , and gradually succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 33]: The Dominie opened his eyes , stared at the deck and carlines above him , then at the cupboard by his side ; lastly , he looked at and recognised me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 6]: _ Eheu , Jacobe _ !
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 5]: -- where am I ?
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 10]: And what is that which presses upon my brain ?
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 15]: What is it so loadeth my cerebellum , even as if it were lead ?
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 7]: My memory -- where is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 8]: Let me recall my scattered senses . ''
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 9]: Here the Dominie was silent for some time .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 4]: `` Ah me !
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 49]: yea , and verily , I do recollect -- with pain of head and more pain of heart -- that which I would fain forget , which is , that I did forget myself ; and indeed have forgotten all that passed the latter portion of the night .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 30]: Friend Dux hath proved no friend , but hath led me into the wrong path : and as or the potation called _ Grog -- Eheu , Jacobe _ !
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 24]: how have I fallen -- fallen in my own opinion -- fallen in thine -- how can I look thee in the face !
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 4]: O , Jacob !
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 17]: what must thou think of him who hath hitherto been thy preceptor and thy guide ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 15]: Here the Dominie fell back on the pillow , and turned away his head .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 39]: `` It is not your fault , sir , '' replied I , to comfort him ; `` you were not aware of what you were drinking -- you did not know that the liquor was so strong .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 6]: Old Tom deceived you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 17]: `` Nay , Jacob , I can not lay that flattering unction to my wounded heart .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 54]: I ought to have known , nay , now I recall to mind , that thou wouldst have warned me -- even to the pulling off of the tail of my coat -- yet I heeded thee not , and I am humbled -- even I , the master over seventy boys ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 24]: `` Nay , sir , it was not I who pulled off the tail of your coat ; it was the dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 38]: `` Jacob , I have heard of the wonderful sagacity of the canine species , yet could not I ever have believed that a dumb brute would have perceived my folly , and warned me from intoxication .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 5]: _ Mirabile dictu _ !
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 37]: Tell me , Jacob , thou who hast profited by these lessons which thy master could give -- although he could not follow up his precept by example -- tell me , what did take place ?
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 11]: Let me know the full extent of my backsliding . ''
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 15]: `` You fell asleep , sir , and we put you to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 10]: `` Who did me that office , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 24]: `` Young Tom and I , sir ; as for old Tom , he was not in a state to help anybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 22]: `` I am humbled , Jacob -- '' `` Nonsense , old gentleman ; why make a fuss about nothing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 14]: said old Tom , who , overhearing our conversation came into the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 20]: `` You had a _ drop _ too much , that 's all , and what o ' that ?
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 9]: It 's a poor heart that never rejoiceth .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 25]: Rouse a bit , wash your face with old Thames water , and in half-an-hour you 'll be as fresh as a daisy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 6]: `` My head acheth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 29]: exclaimed the Dominie , `` even as if there were a ball of lead rolling from one temple to the other ; but my punishment is just . ''
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 35]: `` That is the punishment of making too free with the bottle , for sartain ; but if it is an offence , then it carries its own punishment and that 's quite sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 23]: Every man knows that when the heart 's over light at night , that the head 's over heavy in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 10]: I have known and proved it a thousand times .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 5]: Well , what then ?
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 18]: I puts the good against the bad , and I takes my punishment like a man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 26]: `` Friend Dux , for so I will still call thee , thou lookest not at the offence in a moral point of vision . ''
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 6]: `` What 's moral ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 4]: replied old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 11]: `` I would point out that intoxication is sinful . ''
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 4]: `` Intoxication sinful !
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 13]: I suppose that means that it 's a sin to get drunk .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 54]: Now , master , it 's my opinion that as God Almighty has given us good liquor , it was for no other purpose than to drink it ; and therefore it would be ungrateful to him , and a sin , not to get drunk -- that is , with discretion . ''
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 14]: `` How canst thou reconcile getting drunk with discretion , good Dux ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 53]: `` I mean , master , when there 's work to be done , the work should be done ; but when there 's plenty of time , and everything is safe , and all ready for a start the next morning , I can see no possible objection to a jollification .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 28]: Come , master , rouse out ; the lighter 's abreast of the Hospital almost by this time , and we must put you on shore . ''
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 21]: The Dominie , whose clothes were all on , turned out of his bed-place and went with us on deck .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 24]: Young Tom , who was at the helm , as soon as we made our appearance , wished him a good-morning very respectfully .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 24]: Indeed , I always observed that Tom , with all his impudence and waggery , had a great deal of consideration and kindness .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 21]: He had overheard the Dominie 's conversation with me , and would not further wound his feelings with a jest .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 33]: Old Tom resumed his place at the helm , while his son prepared the breakfast , and I drew a bucket of water for the Dominie to wash his face and hands .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 47]: Of his nose not a word was said ; and the Dominie made no remarks to me on the subject , although I am persuaded it must have been very painful , from the comfort he appeared to derive in bathing it with the freezing water .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 26]: A bowl of tea was a great solace to him , and he had hardly finished it when the lighter was abreast the Hospital stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 10]: Tom jumped into the boat and hauled it alongside .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 37]: I took the other oar , and the Dominie , shaking hands with old Tom , said , `` Thou didst mean kindly , and therefore I wish thee a kind farewell , good Dux . ''
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 25]: `` God be with you , master , '' replied old Tom ; `` shall we call for you as we come back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 23]: `` Nay , nay , '' replied the Dominie , `` the travelling by land is more expensive , but less dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 17]: I thank thee for thy songs , and -- for all thy kindness , good Dux .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 10]: Are my paraphernalia in the boat , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 6]: I replied in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 12]: The Dominie stepped in , and we pulled him on shore .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 40]: He landed , took his bundle and umbrella under his arm , shook hands with Tom and then with me , without speaking , and I perceived the tears start in his eyes as he turned and walked away .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 25]: `` Well , now , '' said Tom , looking after the Dominie , `` I wish I had been drunk instead of he .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 13]: He does so take it to heart , poor old gentleman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 21]: `` He has lost his self-esteem , Tom , '' replied I. `` It should be a warning to you .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 9]: Come , get your oar to pass . ''
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 13]: `` Well , some people he fashioned one way and some another .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 30]: I 've been tipsy more than once , and I never lost anything but my reason , and that came back as soon as the grog left my head .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 14]: I ca n't understand that fretting about having had a glass too much .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 10]: I only frets when I ca n't get enough .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 34]: Well , of all the noses I ever saw , his bests them by chalks ; I did so want to laugh at it , but I knew it would pain him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 23]: `` It is very kind of you , Tom , to hold your tongue , and I thank you very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 27]: `` And yet that old dad of mine swears I 've got no fellow-feeling , which I consider a very undutiful thing for him to say .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 17]: What 's the reason , Jacob , that sons be always cleverer than their fathers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 13]: `` I did n't know that was the case , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 19]: `` But it is so _ now _ , if it was n't in _ olden time _ .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 29]: The proverb says , ` Young people _ think _ old people to be fools , but old people _ know _ young people to be fools . '
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 35]: We must alter that , for I says , ` Old people _ think _ young people to be fools , but young people _ know _ old people to be fools . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 18]: `` Have it your own way , Tom , that will do , rowed of all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 25]: We tossed in our oars , made the boat fast , and gained the deck , where old Tom still remained at the helm .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 70]: `` Well , '' said he , `` Jacob , I never thought I should be glad to see the old gentleman clear of the lighter , but I was -- devilish glad ; he was like a load on my conscience this morning ; he was trusted to my charge by Mr Drummond , and I had no right to persuade him to make a fool of himself .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 43]: But , however , what 's done ca n't be helped , as you say sometimes ; and it 's no use crying ; still it was a pity , for he be , for all the world , like a child .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 25]: There 's a fancy kind of lass in that wherry , crossing _ our _ bows ; look at the streamers from her top-gallant .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 46]: `` Come o'er the sea , Maiden , to me , Mine through sunshine , storm , and snows , Seasons may roll , But the true soul Burns the same wherever it goes Then come o'er the sea , Maiden , with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 12]: `` See you hanged first , you underpinned old hulk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 15]: replied the female in the boat , which was then close under our bows .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 17]: `` Well , that be civil , for certain , '' said old Tom , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIFTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 63]: I AM UNSHIPPED FOR A SHORT TIME , IN ORDER TO RECORD SHIPMENTS AND ENGROSS INVOICES -- FORM A NEW ACQUAINTANCE , WHAT IS CALLED IN THE WORLD `` A WARM MAN , '' THOUGH HE PASSED THE BEST PART OF HIS LIFE AMONG ICEBERGS , AND ONE WHOLE NIGHT WITHIN THE RIBS OF DEATH -- HIS WIFE WORKS HARD AT GENTILITY .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 27]: We arrived at Sheerness the next morning , landed the bricks , which were for the Government buildings , and returned in ballast to the wharf .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 45]: My first inquiry was for the Dominie ; but he had not yet returned ; and Mr Drummond further informed me that he had been obliged to send away his under-clerk and wished me to simply take his place until he could procure another .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 25]: The lighter therefore took in her cargo , and sailed without me , which was of consequence , as my apprenticeship still went on .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 18]: I now lived with Mr Drummond as one of his own family , and wanted for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 37]: His continual kindness to me made me strive all I could to please him by diligence and attention , and I soon became very expert at accounts , and , as he said , very useful .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 19]: The advantages to me , I hardly need observe were considerable , and I gained information every day .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 47]: Still , although I was glad to be of any use to Mr Drummond , the confinement at the desk was irksome , and I anxiously looked for the arrival of the new clerk to take my place and leave me free to join the lighter .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 39]: Mr Drummond did not appear to me to be in any hurry ; indeed , I believe that he would have retained me altogether , had he not perceived that I still wished to be on the river .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 52]: `` At all events , Jacob , I shall keep you here until you are master of your work ; it will be useful to you hereafter , '' he said to me one day ; `` and you do not gain much by sailing up and down the river . ''
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 44]: This was true ; and I also derived much advantage from the evenings spent with Mrs Drummond , who was a very sensible good woman , and would make me read aloud to her and little Sarah as they sat at their needle .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 35]: I had no idea , until I was employed posting up the book , that Mr Drummond 's concern was so extensive , or that there was so much capital employed in the business .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 10]: The Dominie returned a few days after my arrival .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 27]: When we met his nose had resumed its former appearance , and he never brought up the subject of the evening on board of the lighter .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 38]: I saw him frequently , mostly on Sundays after I had been to church with the family ; and half-an-hour , at least , was certain to be dedicated to our reading together one of the classics .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 24]: As I was on shore several months , I became acquainted with many families , one or two of which were worth noticing .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 41]: Among the foremost was Captain Turnbull , at least such was his appellation until within the last two months previous to my making his acquaintance , when Mr Turnbull sent out his cards , _ George Turnbull , Esquire _ .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 92]: The history of Captain Turnbull was as follows : -- He had , with his twin brother , been hung up at the knocker , and afterwards had been educated at the Foundling Hospital ; they had both been apprenticed to the sea ; grown up thorough-bred , capital , seamen in the Greenland fishery ; rose to be mates then captains ; had been very successful , owned part , then the whole of the ship , afterwards two or three ships ; and had wound up with handsome fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 63]: Captain Turnbull was a married man without a family ; his wife , fine in person , vulgar in speech , a would-be fashionable lady , against which fashion Captain T had for years pleaded poverty ; but his brother , who had remained a bachelor , died , leaving him forty thousand pounds -- a fact which could not be concealed .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 60]: Captain Turnbull had not allowed his wife to be aware of the extent of his own fortune , more from a wish to live quietly and happily than from any motive of parsimony , for he was liberal to excess ; but now he had no further excuse to plead , and Mrs Turnbull insisted upon _ fashion _ .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 59]: The house they had lived in was given up , and a marine villa on the borders of the Thames to a certain degree met the views of both parties ; Mrs Turnbull anticipating dinners and fetes , and the captain content to watch what was going on in the river , and amuse himself in a wherry .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 37]: They had long been acquaintances of Mr and Mrs Drummond ; and Captain Turnbull 's character was such as always to command the respect of Mr Drummond , as he was an honest , friendly man .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 23]: Mrs Turnbull had now set up her carriage , and she was , in her own opinion , a very great personage .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 24]: She would have cut all her former acquaintance ; but on that point the captain was inflexible , particularly as regarded the Drummonds .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 32]: As far as they were concerned , Mrs Turnbull gave way , Mrs Drummond being a lady-like woman , and Mr Drummond universally respected as a man of talent and information .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 22]: Captain , or rather , Mr Turnbull , was a constant visitor at our house , and very partial to me .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 30]: He used to scold Mr Drummond for keeping me so close to my desk , and would often persuade him to give me a couple of hours ' run .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 31]: When this was obtained , he would call a waterman , throw him a crown , and tell him to get out of his wherry as fast as he could .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 39]: We then embarked , and amused ourselves pulling up and down the river , while Mrs Turnbull , dressed in the extremity of the fashion , rode out in the carriage and left her cards in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 26]: One day Mr Turnbull called upon the Drummonds , and asked them to dine with him on the following Saturday ; they accepted the invitation .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 66]: `` By-the-by , '' said he , `` I got what my wife calls a _ remind _ in my pocket ; '' and he pulled out of his coat-pocket a large card , `` with Mr and Mrs Turnbull 's compliments , '' etcetera , which card he had doubled in two by his sitting down upon it , shortly after he came in .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 18]: Mr Turnbull straightened it again as well as he could , and laid it on the table .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 14]: `` And Jacob , '' said he , `` you 'll come too .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 20]: You do n't want a remind ; but if you do , my wife will send you one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 15]: I replied , `` that I wanted no remind for a good dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 83]: `` No , I dare say not , my boy ; but recollect that you come an hour or two before the dinner-hour , to help me ; there 's so much fuss with one thing or another , that I 'm left in the lurch ; and as for trusting the keys of the spirit-room to that long-togged rascal of a butler , I 'll see him harpoon 'd first ; so do you come and help me , Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 29]: This having been promised , he asked Mr Drummond to lend me for an hour or so , as he wished to take a row up the river .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 15]: This was also consented to ; we embarked and pulled away for Kew Bridge .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 46]: Mr Turnbull was as good a hand at a yarn as old Tom , and many were the adventures he narrated to me of what had taken place during the vicissitudes of his life , more especially when he was employed in the Greenland fishery .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 33]: He related an accident that morning , which particularly bore upon the marvellous , although I do not believe that he was at all guilty of indulging in a traveller 's licence .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 29]: `` Jacob , '' said he , `` I recollect once when I was very near eaten alive by foxes , and that in a very singular manner .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 9]: I was then mate of a Greenland ship .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 18]: We had been on the fishing ground for three months , and had twelve fish on board .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 33]: Finding we were doing well , we fixed our ice-anchors upon a very large iceberg , drifting up and down with it , and taking fish as we fell in with them .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 73]: One morning we had just cast loose the carcass of a fish which we had cut up , when the man in the crow 's nest , on the look-out for another ` fall , ' cried out that a large polar bear and her cub were swimming over to the iceberg , against the side of which , and about half-a-mile from us , the carcass of a whale was beating .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 39]: As we had nothing to do , seven of us immediately started in chase we had intended to have gone after the foxes , which had gathered there also in hundreds , to prey upon the dead whale .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 49]: It was then quite calm : we soon came up with the bear , who at first was for making off ; but as the cub could not get on over the rough ice as well as the old one , she at last turned round to bay .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 31]: We shot the cub to make sure of her , and it did make sure of the dam not leaving us till either she or we perished in the conflict .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 27]: I never shall forget her moaning over the cub , as it lay bleeding on the ice , while we fired bullet after bullet into her .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 34]: At last she turned round , gave a roar and a gnashing snarl , which you might have heard a mile , and , with her eyes flashing fire , darted upon us .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 67]: We received her in a body , all close together , with our lances to her breast ; but she was so large and strong , that she beat us all back , and two of us fell ; fortunately the others held their ground , and as she was then on end , three bullets were put into her chest , which brought her down .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 11]: I never saw so large a beast in my life .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 31]: I do n't wish to make her out larger than she really was , but I have seen many a bullock at Smithfield which would not weigh two-thirds of her .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 34]: After that , we had some trouble in despatching her ; and while we were so employed , the wind blew up in gusts from the northward , and the snow fell heavy .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 101]: The men were for returning to the ship immediately , which certainly was the wisest thing for us all to do ; but I thought that the snowstorm would blow over in a short time , and not wishing to lose so fine a skin , resolved to remain and flay the beast ; for I knew that if left there a few hours , as the foxes could not get hold of the carcass of the whale , which had not grounded , they would soon finish the bear and the cub , and the skins be worth nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 51]: Well , the other men went back to the ship , and as it was , the snow-storm came on so thick that they lost their way , and would never have found her , if it was not that the bell was kept tolling for a guide to them .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 71]: I soon found that I had done a very foolish thing ; instead of the storm blowing over , the snow came down thicker and thicker ; and before I had taken a quarter of the skin off , I was becoming cold and numbed , and then I was unable to regain the ship , and with every prospect of being frozen to death before the storm was over .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 11]: At last , I knew what was my only chance .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 17]: I had flayed all the belly of the bear , but had not cut her open .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 48]: I ripped her up , tore out all her inside , and then contrived to get into her body , where I lay , and , having closed up the entrance hole , was warm and comfortable , for the animal heat had not yet been extinguished .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 41]: This manoeuvre , no doubt , saved my life : and I have heard that the French soldiers did the same in their unfortunate Russian campaign , killing their horses and getting inside to protect themselves from the dreadful weather .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 39]: Well , Jacob , I had not lain more than half-an-hour , when I knew by sundry jerks and tugs at my newly invented hurricane-house that the foxes were busy -- and so they were sure , enough .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 63]: There must have been hundreds of them , for they were at work in all directions , and some pushed their sharp noses into the opening where I had crept in ; but I contrived to get out my knife and saw their noses across whenever they touched me , otherwise I should have been eaten up in a very short time .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 32]: There were so many of them , and they were so ravenous , that they soon got through the bear 's thick skin , and were tearing away at the flesh .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 29]: Now I was not so much afraid of their eating me , as I thought that if I jumped up and discovered myself they would have all fled .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 63]: No saying , though ; two or three hundred ravenous devils take courage when together ; but I was afraid that they would devour my covering from the weather , and then I should perish with the cold ; and I was also afraid of having pieces nipped out of me , which would of course oblige me to quit my retreat .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 40]: At last daylight was made through the upper part of the carcass , and I was only protected by the ribs of the animal , between which every now and then their noses dived and nipped my sealskin jacket .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 36]: I was just thinking of shouting to frighten them away , when I heard the report of half-a-dozen muskets , and some of the bullets struck the carcass , but fortunately did not hit me .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 19]: I immediately halloed as loud as I could , and the men , hearing me , ceased firing .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 17]: They had fired at the foxes , little thinking that I was inside of the bear .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 23]: I crawled out ; the storm was over , and the men of the ship had come back to look for me .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 39]: My brother , who was also a mate on board of the vessel , who had not been with the first party , had joined them in the search , but with little hopes of finding me alive .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 21]: He hugged me in his arms , covered as I was with blood , as soon as he saw me .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 16]: He 's dead now , poor fellow -- That 's the story , Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 31]: `` Thank you , sir , '' replied I ; but perceiving that the memory of his brother affected him , I did not speak again for a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 18]: We then resumed our conversation , and pulling back with the tide , landed at the wharf .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 22]: On the day of the dinner party I went up to Mr Turnbull 's at three o'clock as he had proposed .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 91]: I found the house in a bustle ; Mr and Mrs Turnbull , with the butler and footman , in the dining-room , debating as to the propriety of _ this _ and _ that _ being placed _ here _ and _ there _ , both servants giving their opinion , and arguing on a footing of equality , contradicting and insisting , Mr Turnbull occasionally throwing in a word , and each time snubbed by his wife , although the servants dare not take any liberty with him .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 16]: `` Do , pray , Mr Turnbull , leave _ h_us to settle these matters .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 11]: Get _ h_up your wine ; that is your department .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 12]: Leave the room , Mr Turnbull , _ h_if you please .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 15]: Mortimer and I know what we are about , without your _ h_interference . ''
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 27]: by the Lord , I do n't wish to interfere ; but I wish you and your servants not to be squabbling , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 35]: If they gave me half the _ cheek _ -- '' `` Do , pray , Mr Turnbull , leave the room , and allow me to regulate my own _ ` ouse_hold . ''
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 23]: `` Come , Jacob , we 'll go down into the cellar , '' said Mr Turnbull ; and accordingly we went .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 19]: I assisted Mr Turnbull in his department as much as I could , but he grumbled very much .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 15]: `` I ca n't bear all this nonsense , all this finery and foolery .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 11]: Everything comes up cold , everything is out of reach .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 31]: The table 's so long , and so covered with uneatables , that my wife is hardly within hail and , by jingo , with her the servants are masters .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 30]: Not with me , at all events ; for if they spoke to me as they do to Mrs Turnbull , I would kick them out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 11]: However , Jacob , there 's no help for it .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 31]: All one asks for is quiet ; and I must put up with all this sometimes , or I should have no quiet from one year 's end to another .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 74]: When a woman will have her way , there 's no stopping her : you know the old verse -- `` A man 's a fool who strives by force or skill To stem the torrent of a woman 's will ; For if she will , she will , you may depend o n't , And if she wo n't , she wo n't -- and there 's an end o n't .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 21]: `` Now let 's go up into my room , and we will chat while I wash my hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 28]: As soon as Mr Turnbull was dressed , we went down into the drawing-room , which was crowded with tables loaded with every variety of ornamental articles .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 10]: `` Now this is what my wife calls fashionable .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 23]: One might as well be steering through an ice-floe as try to come to an anchor here without running foul of something .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 47]: It 's _ hard-a-port _ or _ hard-a-starboard _ every minute ; and if your coat-tail _ jibes _ , away goes something , and whatever it is that smashes , Mrs T always swears it was the _ most valuable _ thing in the room .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 9]: I 'm like a bull in a china-shop .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 16]: One comfort is , that I never come in here except when there 's company .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 10]: Indeed , I 'm not allowed , thank God .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 40]: Sit on a chair , Jacob , one of those spider-like French things , for my wife wo n't allow _ blacks _ , as she calls them , to come to an anchor upon her sky-blue silk sofas .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 14]: How stupid to have furniture that one 's not to make use of !
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 16]: Give me comfort but it appears that 's not to be bought for money . ''
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIXTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 20]: HIGH LIFE ABOVE STAIRS , A LITTLE BELOW THE MARK -- FASHION FRENCH , VIRTUE , AND ALL THAT .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 18]: Six o'clock was now near at hand , and Mrs Turnbull entered the drawing-room in full dress .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 25]: She certainly was a very handsome woman , and had every appearance of being fashionable ; but it was her language which exposed her .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 6]: She was like the peacock .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 19]: As long as she was silent you could but admire the plumage , but her voice spoilt all .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 50]: `` Now , Mr Turnbull , '' said she , `` I wish to _ h_explain to you that there are certain _ h_improprieties in your behaviour which I can not put _ h_up with , particularly that _ h_of talking about when you were before the mast . ''
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 15]: `` Well , my dear , is that anything to be ashamed of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 21]: `` Yes , Mr Turnbull , that _ h_is -- one _ h_always sinks them ere particulars in fashionable society .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 29]: To wirtuperate in company a 'n' t pleasant , and _ H_i 've thought of a plan which may _ h_act as an _ h_impediment to your vulgarity .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 47]: Recollect , Mr T , when_h_ever I say that _ H_i 've an ` eadache , it 's to be a sign for you to ` old your tongue ; and , Mr T , _ h_oblige me by wearing kid gloves all the evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 8]: at dinner time , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 21]: `` Yes , Mr T , at dinner time ; your ` ands are not fit to be touched . ''
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 11]: `` Well , I recollect when you thought otherwise . ''
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 6]: `` When , Mr T ?
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 10]: ` ave I not often told you so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 27]: `` Yes , lately ; but I referred to the time when one Poll Bacon of Wapping took my hand for better or for worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 11]: `` Really , Mr T , you quite shock me .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 16]: My name was Mary , and the Bacons are a good old _ H_inglish name .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 16]: You ` ave their _ h_arms quartered on the carriage in right o ' me .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 10]: That 's something , I can tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 15]: `` Something I had to pay for pretty smartly , at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 26]: `` The payment , Mr T , was on account of granting _ h_arms to you , who never _ ` ad _ any . ''
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 7]: `` And never wished for them .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 9]: What do I care for such stuff ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 32]: `` And when you did choose , Mr Turnbull , you might have consulted me , instead of making yourself the laughing-stock of Sir George Naylor and all the ` eralds .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 28]: Who but a madman would have chosen three harpoons _ saluims _ , and three barrels _ couchants _ , with a spouting whale for a crest ?
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 38]: Just to point out to everybody what should _ h_ever be buried in _ h_oblivion ; and then your beastly motto -- which I _ would have _ changed -- _ ` Blubber for ever _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 3]: Blubber indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 14]: _ h_enough to make _ h_any one _ blubber _ for ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 27]: `` Well , the heralds told me they were just what I ought to have chosen , and very apposite , as they termed it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 10]: `` They took your money and laughed at you .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 27]: Two pair of griffins , a lion , half-a-dozen leopards , and a hand with a dagger , would n't ` ave cost a farthing more .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 14]: But what can you _ h_expect from an _ ` og _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 21]: `` But if I was _ cured _ , I should be what you _ were -- Bacon _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 13]: `` I wo n't _ demean _ myself , Mr Turnbull . ''
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 17]: `` That 's right , my dear , do n't ; there 's no curing you .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 11]: Recollect the motto you chose in preference to mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 28]: `` Well , and a very proper one -- ` _ Too much familiarity breeds contempt _ ' -- is it not so , Master Faithful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 15]: `` Yes , madam , it was one of our copies at school . ''
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 17]: `` I beg your pardon , sir , it was my _ h_own _ h_invention . ''
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 14]: Rap , tap , rap , tap , tap , tap , tap .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 15]: `` Mr and Mrs Peters , of Petercumb Hall , '' announced the butler .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 33]: Enter Mrs Peters first , a very diminutive lady , and followed by Mr Peters , six feet four inches without his shoes , deduct for stooping and curved shoulders seven inches .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 27]: Mr Peters had retired from the Stock Exchange with a competence , bought a place , named it Petercumb Hall , and set up his carriage .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 11]: Another knock , and Mr and Mrs Drummond were announced .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 11]: Compliments exchanged , and a pastile lighted by Mrs Turnbull .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 18]: `` Well , Drummond , '' said Mr Turnbull , `` what are coals worth now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 15]: `` Mr Turnbull , I 've got such an _ ` eadache _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 21]: This was of course a matter of condolence from all present , and a stopper upon Mr Turnbull 's tongue .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 8]: Another sounding rap , and a pause .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 10]: `` Monsieur and Madame de Tagliabue coming up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 7]: Enter Monsieur and Madame de Tagliabue .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 23]: The former , a dapper little Frenchman , with a neat pair of legs , and stomach as round as a pea .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 36]: Madame sailing in like an outward-bound East Indiaman , with studding sails below and aloft ; so large in her dimensions , that her husband might be compared to the pilot-boat plying about her stern .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 9]: `` Charmee de vous voir , Madame Tom-bulle .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 12]: Vous vous portez bien ; n'est - ce pas ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 50]: _ Ve _ , '' replied Mrs Turnbull , who thus exhausted her knowledge of the French language while the Monsieur tried in vain , first on one side , and then on the other , to get from under the lee of his wife and make his bow .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 20]: This was not accomplished until the lady had taken possession of a sofa , which she filled most comfortably .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 24]: Who these people were , and how they lived , I never could find out : they came in a fly from Brentford .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 3]: Another announcement .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 11]: `` My Lord Babbleton and Mr Smith coming up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 12]: `` Mr T , pray go down and receive his lordship .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 33]: -LRB- There are two wax candles for you to light on the hall table , and you must walk up with them before his lordship , '' said the lady aside . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 22]: `` I 'll be hanged if I do , '' replied Mr Turnbull ; `` let the servants light him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 14]: `` O , Mr T , I 've such an ` eadache ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 15]: `` So you may have , '' replied Mr T , sitting down doggedly .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 36]: In the meantime Mr Smith entered , leading Lord Babbleton , a boy of twelve or thirteen years old , shy , awkward , red-haired , and ugly , to whom Mr Smith was tutor .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 50]: Mrs T had found out Mr Smith , who was residing near Brentford with his charge , and made his acquaintance on purpose to have a lord on her visiting list , and , to her delight , the leader had not forgotten to bring his bear with him .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 28]: Mrs Turnbull sprang to the door to receive them , making a prepared courtesy to the aristocratical cub , and then shaking him respectfully by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 10]: `` Wo n't your lordship walk to the fire ?
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 6]: Is n't your lordship cold ?
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 14]: I hope your lordship 's sty is better in your lordship 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 32]: Allow me to introduce to your lordship 's notice Mr and Mrs Peters -- Madame and Mounsheer Tagleebue -- Mr and Mrs Drummond , the Right Honourable Lord Viscount Babbleton . ''
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 16]: As for Mr Turnbull and myself , we were left out as unworthy of introduction .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 11]: `` We are ready for dinner , Mr Turnbull . ''
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 16]: `` Snobbs , get dinner dressed up , '' said Mr T to the butler .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 14]: `` O , Mr T , I 've such an ` eadache . ''
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 60]: This last headache was produced by Mr T forgetting himself , and calling the butler by his real name , which was Snobbs ; but Mrs Turnbull had resolved that it should be changed to _ Mortimer _ -- or rather , to Mr Mortimer , as the household were directed to call him , on pain of expulsion .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 4]: Dinner was announced .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 32]: Madame Tagliabue , upon what pretence I know not , was considered the first lady in the room , and Lord Babbleton was requested by Mrs Turnbull to hand her down .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 14]: Madame rose , took his lordship 's hand , and led him away .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 39]: Before they were out of the room , his lordship had disappeared among the ample folds of Madame 's gown , and was seen no more until she pulled him out , on their arrival at the dinner-table .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 32]: At last we were all arranged according to Mrs Turnbull 's wishes , although there were several chops and changes about , until the order of precedence could be correctly observed .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 69]: A French cook had been sent for by Mrs Turnbull ; and not being mistress of the language , she had a card with the names of the dishes to refresh her memory , Mr Mortimer having informed her that such was always the custom among great people , who , not ordering their own dinners , of course they could not tell what there was to eat .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 12]: `` Mrs Turnbull , what soup have you there ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 8]: _ Consummy _ soup , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 21]: Will your lordship _ make use _ of that or of this here , which is _ o'juss _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 20]: His lordship stared , made no answer ; looked foolish ; and Mr Mortimer placed some soup before him .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 28]: `` Lord Babbleton takes soup , '' said Mr Smith , pompously ; and the little right honourable supped soup , much to Mrs Turnbull 's satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 7]: `` Madame , do you soup ?
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 6]: or do you fish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 11]: `` Merci , no soup -- _ poisson _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 31]: `` Do n't be afraid , madame ; we 've a French cook : you wo n't be _ poisoned _ here , '' replied Mrs Turnbull , rather annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 18]: `` Comment , my chere madame , I meant to say dat I prefer de cod . ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 9]: `` Mr T , some soup for Madame .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 11]: John , a _ clean _ plate for Lord Babbleton .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 14]: What will your lordship condescend to _ make use _ of now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 18]: -LRB- Mrs Turnbull thought the phrase , _ make use _ , excessively refined and elegant . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 36]: `` Ah , madame , votre cuisine est superbe , '' exclaimed Monsieur Tagliabue , tucking the corner of his napkin into his button-hole , and making preparations for well filling his little rotundity . ''
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 9]: _ Ve _ , '' replied Mrs Turnbull .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 13]: `` Mrs Peters , will you try the dish next Mr Turnbull ?
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 15]: -LRB- _ looking at her card _ -RRB- -- '' _ Agno roty _ .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 6]: Will you , my lord ?
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 19]: If your lordship has not yet got into your French -- it means roast quarter of lamb . ''
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 17]: `` His lordship is very partial to lamb , '' said Mr Smith , with emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 16]: `` Mr Turnbull , some lamb for Lord Babbleton , and for Mr Peters . ''
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 6]: `` Directly , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 18]: -- Well , Jacob , you see , when I was first mate -- '' `` Dear !
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 10]: Mr Turnbull -- I 've such an ` eadache .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 8]: Do , pray , cut the lamb .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 6]: -LRB- _ Aside _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 21]: Mr Mortimer , do go and whisper to Mr Turnbull that I beg he will put on his gloves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 9]: `` Mrs Peters , you 're doing nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 19]: Mr Mortimer , ` and round the side dishes , and let John serve out the champagne . ''
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 15]: `` Mrs Peters , there 's a _ wolley went o ' weaters _ .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 7]: Will you make use of some ?
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 11]: Mrs Drummond , will you try the dish coming round ?
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 12]: It is -- let me see -- _ chew farsy _ .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 16]: My Lord Babbleton , I ` ope the lamb 's _ to your liking _ ?
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 11]: Monshere Tagliabue -- William , give Monshere a clean plate .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 7]: What will you take next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 11]: `` Vraiment , madame , tout est excellent , superbe !
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 19]: Je voudrais embrasser votre cuisinier -- c'est un artiste comme il n ' y a pas ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 9]: _ Ve _ , '' replied Mrs Turnbull .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 18]: The first course was removed ; and the second , after some delay , made its appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 15]: In the interim , Mr Mortimer handed round one or two varieties of wine .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 14]: `` Drummond , will you take a glass of wine with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 4]: said Mr Turnbull .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 8]: `` I hate your sour French wines .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 5]: Will you take Madeira ?
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 44]: I was on shore at Madeira once for a few hours , when I was before the mast , in the -- '' `` Mr Turnbull , I 've such an ` eadache , '' cried his lady , in an angry tone .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 11]: `` My lord , will you take some of this ?
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 18]: -- it is _ ding dong o ' turf _ -- a turkey , my lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 15]: `` His lordship is fond of turkey , '' said Mr Smith , dictatorially .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 31]: Monsieur Tagliabue , who sat on the other side of Mrs T , found that the turkey was in request -- it was some time before he could help himself .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 5]: `` C'est superbe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 10]: said Monsieur , thrusting a truffle into his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 13]: `` Apparemment , madame , n'aime pas la cuisine Anglaise ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 9]: _ Ve _ , '' replied Mrs Turnbull .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 12]: `` Madame , what will you be _ h_assisted to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 12]: continued Mrs T. `` Tout de bon , madame . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 14]: _ Ve _ ; what are those by you , Mr Peters ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 6]: inquired the lady in continuation .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 17]: `` I really can not exactly say ; but they are fritters of some sort . ''
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 7]: `` Let me see -- hoh !
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 4]: bidet du poms .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 13]: Madame , will you eat some _ bidet du poms _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 18]: `` Comment , madame , je ne vous comprends pas -- '' '' _ Ve _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 20]: `` Monsieur Tagliabue , expliquez donc ; '' said the foreign lady , red as a quarter of beef .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 12]: `` Permettez , '' said Monsieur , looking at the card .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 15]: `` Ah , c'est impossible , ma chere , '' continued he , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 16]: `` Madame Turnbull se trompait ; elle voudrait dire _ Beignets de pommes _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 14]: `` Vous trouvez notre langue fort difficile , n'est - ce pas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 44]: continued madame , who recovered her good humour , and smiled graciously at Mrs T. '' _ Ve _ , '' replied Mrs Turnbull , who perceived that she had made some mistake , and was anxiously awaiting the issue of the dialogue .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 22]: It had , however , the effect of checking Mrs T , who said little more during the dinner and dessert .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 36]: At last the ladies rose from the dessert , and left the gentlemen at the table ; but we were not permitted to remain long before coffee was announced , and we went up stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 17]: A variety of French liqueurs were handed about , and praised by most of the company .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 16]: Mr Turnbull , however , ordered a glass of brandy as a _ settler _ .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 11]: Mr Turnbull , I 've such an ` eadache ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 8]: After that the party became very dull .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 8]: Lord Babbleton fell asleep on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 19]: Mr Peters walked round the room , admiring the pictures , and asking the names of the masters .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 20]: `` I really quite forget ; but , Mr Drummond , you are a judge of paintings I hear .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 10]: Who do you think this is painted by ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 11]: said the lady , pointing to a very inferior performance .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 20]: `` I am not quite sure ; but I think it is Van -- Van _ Daub _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 29]: `` I should think so too , '' replied Mr Drummond , drily ; `` we have a great many pictures in England by the same hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 31]: The French gentleman proposed _ ecarte _ , but no one knew how to play it except his wife ; who sat down with him to pass away the time .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 80]: The ladies sauntered about the room , looking at the contents of the tables , Mrs Peters occasionally talking of Petercumb Hall ; Mr Smith played at patience in one corner ; while Mr Turnbull and Mr Drummond sat in another in close conversation ; and the lady of the house divided her attentions , running from one to the other , and requesting them not to talk so loud as to awake the Right Honourable Lord Viscount Babbleton .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 28]: At last the vehicles were announced , and the fashionable party broke up , much to the satisfaction of everybody , and to none more than myself .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 43]: I ought to observe that all the peculiar absurdities I have narrated did not strike me so much at the time ; but it was an event to me to dine out , and the scene was well impressed upon my memory .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 32]: After what occurred to me in my after life , and when I became better able to judge of fashionable pretensions , the whole was vividly brought back to my recollection .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 54]: THE TOMKINSES ' FETE CHAMPETRE AND FETE DANSANTE -- LIGHTS AMONG THE GOOSEBERRY-BUSHES -- ALL WENT OFF WELL , EXCEPTING THE LIGHTS , THEY WENT OUT -- A WINDING UP THAT HAD NEARLY PROVED A CATASTROPHE -- OLD TOM PROVES THAT DANGER MAKES FRIENDS BY A YARN , YOUNG TOM BY A FACT .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 44]: I remained with Mr Drummond about eight months , when at last the new clerk made his appearance -- a little fat fellow , about twenty , with a face as round as a full moon , thick lips , and red cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 41]: During this time I frequently had the pleasure of meeting with old and young Tom , who appeared very anxious that I should rejoin them ; and I must say that I was equally willing to return to the lighter .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 76]: Still Mr Drummond put his veto on it , and Mrs Drummond was also constantly pointing out the very desirable situation I might have on shore as a clerk in the office ; but I could not bear it -- seated nearly the whole day -- perched up on a high stool -- turning over Debtors , contra Creditors , and only occasionally interrupted by the head clerk , with his attempt to make rhymes .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 15]: The new clerk came , I expected my release , but I was disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 28]: Mr Drummond discovered him to be so awkward , and the head clerk declared that the time was so busy , that he could not spare me .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 57]: This was true ; Mr Drummond had just come to a final arrangement , which had been some time pending , by which he purchased a wharf and large warehouses , with a house adjoining , in Lower Thames Street -- a very large concern , for which he had paid a considerable sum of money .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 63]: What with the valuations , winding up of the Brentford concern on the old account , etcetera , there was much to do , and I toiled at the desk until the removal took place ; and when the family were removed , I was still detained , as there was no warehouseman to superintend the unloading and hoisting up of goods .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 48]: Mr Tomkins , the head clerk , who had been many years a faithful servant to Mr Drummond , was admitted a partner , and had charge of the Brentford wharf , a species of promotion which he and his wife resolved to celebrate with a party .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 28]: After a long debate , it was resolved that they should give a ball , and Mrs Tomkins exerted all her taste and ingenuity on the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 40]: My friend Tomkins lived at a short distance from the premises , in a small house , surrounded with half an acre of garden , chiefly filled with gooseberry-bushes , and perambulated by means of four straight gravel walks .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 25]: Mr and Mrs Drummond were invited , and accepted the invitation , which was considered by the Tomkinses as a great mark of condescension .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 84]: As a specimen of Mr Tomkins 's poetical talents , I shall give his invitation to Mr Drummond , written in the very best German text : -- `` Mr and Mrs T -- Sincerely hope to see Mr and Mrs Drum - Mond , to a very hum - Ble party that they in - Tend to ask their kin To , on the Saturday Of the week ensuing : When fiddles they will play , And other things be doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 6]: _ Belle Vue House _ .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 28]: To which _ jeu d'esprit _ Mr Drummond answered with a pencil on a card -- `` Mr and Mrs Drum - Mond intend to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 20]: `` Here , give Tomkins that , Jacob ; it will please him better than any formal acceptation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 18]: Mr and Mrs Turnbull were also asked ; the former accepted , but the latter indignantly refused .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 60]: When I arrived with Mr and Mrs Drummond many of the company were there ; the garden was what they called illuminated , that is , every gooseberry-bush had one variegated lamp suspended above the centre ; and , as Mr Tomkins told me afterwards , the lamps were red and yellow , according to the fruit they bore .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 32]: It was a cold , frosty , clear night , and the lamps twinkled as brightly among the bare boughs of the gooseberry trees as the stars did in the heavens .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 11]: The company in general were quite charmed with the novelty .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 32]: `` Quite a _ minor Wauxhall _ , '' cried one lady , whose exuberance of fat kept her warm enough to allow her to stare about in the open air .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 19]: The entrance porch had a dozen little lamps , backed with laurel twigs , and looked very imposing .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 37]: Mrs Tomkins received her company upon the steps outside , that she might have the pleasure of hearing their praises of her external arrangements ; still it was freezing , and she shivered not a little .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 34]: The drawing-room , fourteen feet by ten , was fitted up as a ballroom , with two fiddlers and a fifer sitting in a corner and a country-dance was performing when we arrived .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 57]: Over the mantle-piece was a square of laurel twigs , inclosing as a frame this couplet from the poetical brain of the master of the house , cut out in red paper , and bespangled with blue and yellow tinsel -- `` Here we are to dance so gay , While the fiddlers play away . ''
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 23]: Other appropriate distichs , which I have now forgotten , were framed in the same way on each of the other compartments .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 10]: But the dining-room was the _ chef d'oeuvre _ .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 32]: It was formed into a bower , with evergreens , and on the evergreen boughs were stuck real apples and oranges in all directions , so that you could help yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 13]: `` Vell , I do declare , this is a paradise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 9]: exclaimed the fat lady who entered with me .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 37]: `` In all but one thing , ma'am , '' replied Mr Turnbull , who , with his coat off , was squeezing lemons for the punch -- `` there 's no _ forbidden _ fruit .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 6]: You may help yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 50]: The bon-mot was repeated by Mr Tomkins to the end of his existence , not only for its own sake , but because it gave him an opportunity of entering into a detail of the whole _ fete _ -- the first he had ever given in his life .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 39]: `` Ah , Jacob , my boy , glad to see you -- come and help here -- they 'll soon be thirsty , I 'll warrant , '' said Mr Turnbull , who was in his glory .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 92]: The company , although not so very select , were very happy ; they danced , drank punch , laughed , and danced again ; and it was not till a late hour , long after Mr and Mrs Drummond had gone home , that I quitted the `` festive scene ; '' Mr Turnbull , who walked away with me , declaring that it was worth a dozen of his party , although they had not such grand people as Mrs Tagliabue , or the Right Honourable Lord Viscount Babbleton .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 102]: I thought so too ; every one was happy , and every one at their ease ; and I do believe they would have stayed much longer , but the musicians took so much punch that one fiddler broke his fiddle , the other broke his head in going down the steps into the garden , and the fifer swore he could blow no longer ; so , as there was an end to the music , clogs , pattens , and lanterns were called for , the shawls were brought out of the kitchen , and every one went away .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 8]: Nothing could _ go off better _ .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 31]: Mrs Tomkins had a cold and rheumatism the next day ; but that was not surprising , a _ minor Wauxhall _ not being seasonable in the month of December .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 19]: A week after this party we removed to Thames Street , and I performed the duty of warehouseman .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 18]: Our quantity of lighters was now much increased , and employed in carrying dry goods , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 75]: One morning old Tom came under the crane to discharge his lighter , and wishing to see me , when the fall had been overhauled down to heave up the casks with which the lighter was laden , instead of hooking on a cask , held on by his hands , crying , `` Hoist away , '' intending to be hoisting himself up to the door of the warehouse where I was presiding .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 93]: Now , there was nothing unusual in this whim of old Tom 's , but still he ran a very narrow chance , in consequence of an extra whim of young Tom 's , who , as soon as his father was suspended in the air , caught hold of his two wooden stumps , to be hoisted up also ; and as he caught hold of them , standing on tiptoe , they both swung clear of the lighter , which could not approach to within five feet of the buildings .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 16]: The crane was on the third story of the warehouse , and very high up .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 16]: `` Tom , Tom , you rascal , what the devil are you about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 19]: cried the old man , when he felt the weight of his son 's body hanging to him .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 20]: `` Going up along with you , father -- hope we shall go to heaven the same way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 21]: `` More likely to go to the devil together , you little fool ; I never can bear your weight .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 8]: Hoist away , there , quick . ''
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 60]: Hearing the voices , I looked out of the door , and perceiving their situation , ordered the men to hoist as fast as they could , before old Tom 's strength should be exhausted ; but it was a compound moving crane , and we could not hoist very fast , although we could hoist very great weights .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 20]: At last , as they were wound up higher and higher , old Tom 's strength was going fast .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 11]: `` O Tom , Tom , what must be done ?
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 23]: I ca n't -- I ca n't hold on but a little longer , and we shall be both dashed to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 5]: My poor boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 26]: `` Well , then , I 'll let go , father ; it was all my folly , and I 'll be the sufferer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 5]: `` Let go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 26]: cried old Tom ; `` no , no , Tom -- do n't let go , my boy ; I 'll try a little longer .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 15]: Do n't let go , my dear boy -- do n't let go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 14]: `` Well , father , how much longer can you hold on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 16]: `` A little -- very little longer , '' replied the old man , struggling .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 125]: `` Well , hold fast now , '' cried young Tom , who , raising his head above his arms , with great exertion shifted one of his hands to his father 's thigh , then the other ; raising himself as before , he then caught at the seat of his father 's trousers with his teeth ; old Tom groaned , for his son had taken hold of more than the garments ; he then shifted his hands round his father 's body -- from thence he gained the collar of his jacket -- from the collar he climbed on his father 's shoulders , from thence he seized hold of the fall above , and relieved his father of the weight .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 11]: `` Now , father , are you all right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 13]: cried Tom , panting as he clung to the fall above him .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 22]: `` I ca n't hold on ten seconds more , Tom -- no longer -- my clutch is going now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 22]: `` Hang on by your eyelids , father , if you love me , '' cried young Tom , in agony .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 65]: It was indeed an awful moment ; they were now at least sixty feet above the lighter , suspended in the air ; the men whirled round the wheel , and I had at last the pleasure of hauling them both in on the floor of the warehouse ; the old man so exhausted that he could not speak for more than a minute .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 13]: Young Tom , as soon as all was safe , laughed immoderately .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 5]: Old Tom sat upright .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 21]: `` It might have been no laughing matter , Mr Tom , '' said he , looking at his son .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 15]: `` What 's done ca n't be helped , father , as Jacob says .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 11]: After all , you 're more frightened than hurt . ''
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 41]: `` I do n't know that , you young scamp , '' replied the old man , putting his hand behind him , and rubbing softly ; `` you 've bit a piece clean out of my _ starn _ .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 12]: Now , let this be a warning to you , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 30]: Jacob , my boy , could n't you say that I 've met with an _ accident _ , and get a drop of something from Mr Drummond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 45]: I thought , after his last observation , I might honestly say that he had met with an accident , and I soon returned with a glass of brandy , which old Tom was drinking off when his son interrupted him for a share .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 12]: `` You know , father , I shared the danger . ''
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 47]: `` Yes , Tom , I know you did , '' replied the father ; `` but this was sent to me on account of my _ accident _ , and as I had that all to myself , I shall have all this too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 29]: `` But , father , you ought to give me a drop , if it were only to _ take the taste out of my mouth _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 18]: `` Your own flesh and blood , Tom , '' replied his father , emptying his glass .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 37]: `` Well , I always heard it was quite unnatural not to like your own flesh and blood , '' replied Tom ; `` but I see now that there may be reasons for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 23]: `` Be content , Tom , '' replied his father , putting down the glass ; `` we 're now just square .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 16]: You 've had your _ raw nip _ , and I 've had mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 14]: Mr Drummond now came up , and asked what had been the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 9]: `` Nothing , sir -- only an accident .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 13]: Tom and I had a bit of a _ hoist _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 30]: As this last word had a double meaning , Mr Drummond thought that a cask had surged , when coming out of the lighter , and struck them down .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 21]: He desired old Tom to be more careful , and walked away , while we proceeded to unload the lighter .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 71]: The new clerk was a very heavy , simple young man , plodding and attentive certainly , but he had no other merit ; he was sent into the lighter to rake the marks and numbers of the casks as they were hoisted up , and soon became a butt to young Tom , who gave him the wrong marks and numbers of all the casks , to his interrogations .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 8]: `` What 's that , boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 18]: cried the pudding-faced fellow , with his pencil in one hand and his book in the other .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 17]: `` Pea soup , 13 , '' replied Tom ; `` ladies ' bonnets , 24 .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 21]: Now , then , master , chalk again , pipe-clay for sodgers , 3 ; red herrings , 26 . ''
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 25]: All of which were carefully noted down by Mr Grubbins who , when the lighter was cleared , took the memoranda to Mr Drummond .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 21]: Fortunately , we had checked the number of the casks as they were received above -- their contents were flour .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 18]: Mr Drummond sent for young Tom , and asked him how he dared play such a trick .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 36]: Tom replied very boldly , `` that it was meant as a good lesson to the young man , that in future he did his own work , and did not trust to others . ''
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 14]: To this Mr Drummond agreed , and Master Tom was dismissed without punishment .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 25]: As the men had all gone to dinner , I went down into the lighter to have a little chat with my old shipmates .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 29]: `` Well , Jacob , '' said old Tom , `` Tom 's not a bit wiser than he was before -- two scrapes to-day , already . ''
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 26]: `` Well , father , if I prove my folly by getting into scrapes , I prove my wit by getting out of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 29]: `` Yes , that may be true , Tom ; but suppose we had both come down with a run , what would you have thought then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 15]: `` I suspect , father , that I should have been past thinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 47]: `` I once did see a thing of that kind happen , '' said old Tom , calling to mind former scenes in his life ; `` and I 'll tell you a yarn about it , boys , because they say danger makes friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 73]: We sat down by old Tom , who narrated as follows `` When I was captain of the main-top in the _ La Minerve _ , forty-four gun frigate , we were the smartest ship up the Mediterranean ; and many 's the exercise we were the means of giving to other ship 's companies , because they could not beat us -- no , not even hold a candle to us .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 30]: In both fore and main-top we had eight-and-twenty as smart chaps as ever put their foot to a rattling , or slid down by an a ` ter backstay .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 23]: Now , the two captains of the foretop were both prime young men , active as monkeys , and bold as lions .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 36]: One was named Tom Herbert , from North Shields , a dark , good-looking chap , with teeth as white as a nigger 's , and a merry chap he was , always a-showing them .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 7]: The other was a cockney chap .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 49]: Your Lunnuners ar n't often good seamen ; but when they are seamen , there 's no better ; they never allow any one to show them the way , that 's for sartin , being naturally spunky sort of chaps , and full of tricks and fun .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 25]: This fellow 's name was Bill Wiggins , and between him and Herbert there was always a jealousy who should be the smartest man .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 68]: I 've seen both of them run out on the yard , in fine weather , without holding on nothing , seize the lift , and down to their station , haul up the earing , in no time ; up by the lift again , and down on deck , by the backstay , before half the men had time to get clear of the top .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 27]: In fact , they often risked their lives in bad weather , when there was no occasion for it , that one might outdo the other .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 59]: Now , this was all very well , and a good example to the other men : the captain and officers appeared to like these contests for superiority , but it ended in their hating each other , and not being even on speaking terms , which , as the two captains of the top , was bad .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 69]: They had quarrelled often , and fought five times , neither proving the better man ; either both done up , or parted by the master-at-arms , and reported to the first lieutenant , so that at last they were not so much countenanced by the officers , and were out of favour with the captain , who threatened to disrate them both if ever they fought again .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 31]: We were cruising off the Gulf of Lyons , where sometimes it blows hard enought to blew the devil 's horns off , though the gales never last very long .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 46]: We were under close reefed fore - and main-top sails , storm stay-sail and trysail , when there was a fresh hand at the bellows , and the captain desired the officers of the watch , just before dinner to take in the fore-top sail .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 72]: Not to disturb the watch below , the main-top men were ordered up forward to help the fore-top men of the watch ; and I was of course aloft , ready to lie out on the lee yard-arm -- when Wiggins , who had the watch below , came up in the top , not liking that Herbert should be at work in such weather without he being there too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 17]: ` Tom , ' says to me , ` I 'll take the yard-arm . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 23]: ` Very well , ' say I , ` with all my heart ; then I 'll look to the bunt . '
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 50]: `` Just at that time there came on a squall with rain , which almost blinded us ; the sail was taken in very neatly , the clew-lines , chock-a-block , bunt-lines and leech-lines well up , reef-tackles overhauled , rolling-tackles taut , and all as it should be .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 71]: The men lied out on the yard , the squall wore worse and worse , but they were handing in the leech of the sail , when snap went one bunt-line , then the other ; the sail flapped and flagged , till away went the leech-lines , and the men clung to the yards for their lives ; for the sail mastered them , and they could do nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 43]: At last it split like thunder , buffeting the men on the yard-arms till they were almost senseless , until to windward it wore away into long coach whips , and the whole of the canvas left was at the lee yard-arm .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 70]: The men laid in at last with great difficulty , quite worn out by fatigue and clinging for their existence ; all but Wiggins , who was barred by the sail to leeward from making his footing good on the horse , and there he was , poor fellow , completely in irons , and so beaten by the canvas that he could hardly be said to be sensible .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 20]: It takes a long while to tell all this , but it was n't the work of a minute .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 64]: At last he made an attempt to get up by the lift , but was struck down , and would have been hurled overboard if it had n't been that his leg fell over the horse , and there he was , head downwards , hanging over a raging sea , ready to swallow him up as soon as he dropt into it .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 65]: As every one expected he would be beat off before any assistance could be given , you may guess that it was an awful moment to those below who were looking up at him , watching for his fall and the roll of the ship , to see if he fell clear into the sea , or was dashed to pieces in the fore-chains .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 148]: `` I could n't bear to see a fellow-creature , and good seaman in the bargain , in that state , and although the captain dare not _ order _ any one to help him , yet there were one or two midshipmen hastening up the fore-rigging , with the intent , I have no doubt , of trying to save him -LRB- for midshipmen do n't value their lives at a quid of tobacco -RRB- , so I seizes the studding sail halyards , and runs up the topmast rigging , intending to go down by the lift , and pass a bowling knot round him before he fell , when who should I meet at the cross-trees but Tom Herbert , who snatched the rope out of my hand , bawling to me through the gale , ` This is my business , Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 55]: `` Down he goes by the lift , the remainder of the canvas flapped over him , and I seed no more until I heard a cry from all below , and away went Herbert and Wiggins , both together , flying to leeward just as the ship was taking her recovery to windward .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 27]: Fortunately they both fell clear of the ship about two feet , not more , and as their fall was expected , they had prepared below .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 60]: A master 's mate , of the name of Simmonds , and the captain of the forecastle , both went overboard in bowling knots , with another in their hands , and in a minute or two they were all four on board again ; but Herbert and were both senseless , and a long while coming to again .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 14]: Well , now , what do you think was the upshot of it ?
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 72]: Why , they were the best friends in the world ever afterwards , and would have died for one another ; and if one had a glass of grog from the officers for any little job , instead of touching his forelock and drinking it off to the officer 's health , he always took it out of the gun-room , that he might give half of it to the other .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 22]: So , d'ye see my boys , as I said before I began my yarn , that danger makes friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 31]: 'T is said we vent ` rous die hard , When we leave the shore , Our friends may mourn , lest we return To bless their sight no more .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 18]: But this is all a notion Bold Jack ca n't understand ; Some die upon the ocean .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 8]: And some die upon dry land . ''
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 25]: `` And if we had tumbled , father , we should have just died betwixt and between , not water enough to float us .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 22]: It would have been _ woolez wous parlez wous _ , plump in the mud , as you say sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 7]: `` Why , yes , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 29]: I 've a notion that I should have been planted too deep ever to have struck , '' replied the old man , looking at his wooden stumps .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 24]: `` Why , yes , father , _ legs _ are _ legs _ , when you tumble into six foot of mud .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 20]: How you would have _ dibbled _ down , if your _ daddles _ had n't held on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 23]: `` Well then , Tom , recollect that you never _ sell _ your father for a _ lark _ again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 30]: Tom laughed , and catching at the word , although used in a different sense , sung -- `` Just like the _ lark _ high poised in air .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 31]: `` And so were you , father , only you did n't sing as he does , and you did n't leave your young one below in the nest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 26]: `` Ay , it is the young uns which prevent the old ones from rising in the world -- that 's very true , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 8]: Holla , who have we got here ?
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 10]: My service to you , at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 77]: THE ART OF HARD LYING MADE EASY , THOUGH I AM MADE VERY UNEASY BY HARD LYING -- I SEND MY RULER AS A MISSIVE , TO LET THE PARTIES CONCERNED KNOW THAT I AM A REBEL TO TYRANNICAL RULE -- I AM ARRAIGNED , TRIED , AND CONDEMNED WITHOUT A HEARING -- WHAT I LOSE IN SPEECH IS MADE UP IN FEELING , THE WHOLE WOUND UP WITH MAGNANIMOUS RESOLVES , AND A LITTLE SOBBING .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 22]: It was the captain of the American schooner , from out of which we were then taking the casks of flour .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 25]: `` We 've no _ sarvice _ in our country , I 've a notion , my old bobtail roarer , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 19]: `` When do you come alongside of my schooner , for tother lading with this raft of yours ?
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 7]: Not to-night , I guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 31]: `` Well , you 've guessed right this time , '' replied old Tom ; `` we shall lie on the mud till to-morrow morning , with your permission . ''
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 12]: `` Yes , for all the world like a Louisiana alligator .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 15]: You take things coolly , I 've a notion , in the old country .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 33]: I do n't want to be hanging head and starn in this little bit of a river of your ` n. I must be back to New York afore fever time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 30]: `` She be a pretty craft , that little thing of yours , '' observed old Tom ; `` how long may she take to make the run ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 4]: `` How long ?
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 30]: I expect in just no time ; and she 'd go as fast again , only she wo n't wait for the breeze to come up with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 10]: `` Why do n't you heave-to for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 4]: said young Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 9]: `` Lose too much time , I guess .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 28]: I have been chased by an easterly wind all the way from your Land 's End to our Narrows , and it never could overhaul me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 17]: `` And I presume the porpoises give it up in despair , do n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 34]: replied old Tom , with a leer ; `` and yet I 've seen the creatures playing across the bows of an English frigate at her speed , and laughing at her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 42]: `` They never play their tricks with me , old snapper ; if they do , I cuts them in halves , and a-starn they go , head part floating on one side , and tail part on the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 16]: `` But do n't they join together again when they meet in your wake ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 3]: inquired Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 11]: `` Should n't wonder , '' replied the American captain .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 20]: `` Pray , captain , what may be that vessel they talk so much about at New York ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 32]: Old Tom referred to the first steam vessel , whose qualities at that time had been tried , and an exaggerated report of which had been copied from the American papers .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 28]: `` That ship , or whatever she may be , that sails without masts , yards , or canvas ; it is quite above my comprehension . ''
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 10]: `` Old country heads ca n't take it in .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 62]: I 'll tell you what -- she goes slick through the water , a-head or a-starn , broadside on , or up or down , or any way ; and all you have to do is to poke the fire and warm your fingers ; and the more you poke , the faster she goes ` gainst wind and tide . ''
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 18]: `` Well , I must see that to believe it , though , '' replied old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 10]: `` No fear of a capsize , I calculate .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 43]: My little craft did upset with me one night , in a pretty comfortable heavy _ gal _ ; but she 's _ smart _ , and came up again on the other side in a moment , all right as before .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 38]: Never should have known anything about it , if the man at the wheel had not found his jacket wet , and the men below had a round turn in all the clews of their hammocks . ''
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 17]: `` After that round turn , you may belay , '' cried young Tom , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 21]: `` Yes , but do n't let 's have a stopper over all , Tom , '' replied his father .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 10]: `` I consider all this excessively _ divarting _ .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 15]: Pray , captain , does everything else go fast in the new country . ''
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 13]: `` Everything with us _ clean slick _ , I guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 11]: `` What sort of horses have you in America ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 16]: inquired I. `` Our Kentucky horses , I 've a notion , would surprise you .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 19]: They 're almighty goers ; at a trot , beat a _ North West gal _ of wind .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 30]: I once took an Englishman with me in a gig up Allibama country , and he says , ` What 's this great churchyard we are passing through ? '
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 26]: ` And stranger , ' says I , ` I calculate it 's nothing but the milestones we are passing so _ slick _ . '
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 19]: But I once had a horse , who , I expect , was a deal quicker than that .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 24]: I once seed a flash of lightning chase him for half-an-hour round the clearance , and I guess it could n't catch him .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 8]: But I ca n't wait no longer .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 11]: I expect you 'll come alongside to-morrow afore meridian . ''
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 46]: `` Ay , ay , master , '' replied old Tom , tuning up -- '' 'T was post meridian , half-past four , By signal I from Nancy parted , At five she lingered on the shore , With uplift eyes and broken-hearted . ''
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 30]: `` I calculate you are no fool of a screamer , '' said the American , shoving off his boat from the barge , and pulling to his vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 17]: `` And I calculate you 're no fool of a liar , '' said young Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 24]: `` Well , so he is ; but I do like a good lie , Jacob , there 's some fun in it .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 21]: But what the devil does the fellow mean by calling a gale of wind -- _ a gal _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 27]: `` I do n't know , '' replied Tom , `` unless for the same reason that we call a girl _ a blowing _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 22]: Our conversation was here interrupted by Mr Hodgson , the new head clerk , of whom I have hitherto said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 46]: He came into the establishment in the place of Mr Tomkins , when we quitted the Battersea wharf , and had taken an evident dislike to me , which appeared to increase every day , as Mr Drummond gave me fresh marks of his approbation .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 18]: `` You , Faithful , come out of that barge directly , and go to your desk .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 8]: I will have no eye-servers under me .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 8]: Come out , sir , directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 26]: `` I say , Mr Quilldriver , '' cried old Tom , `` do you mean for to say that Jacob is an eye-sarver ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 24]: `` Yes , I do ; and want none of your impertinence , or I 'll unship you , you old blackguard . ''
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 36]: `` Well , then , for the first part of your story , my sarvice to you and you _ lies _ ; and as for the second , that remains to be proved . ''
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 14]: Mr Hodgson 's temper was not softened by this reply of old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 25]: My blood was also up , for I had borne much already ; and young Tom was bursting with impatience to take my part .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 43]: He walked carelessly by the head clerk , saying to me as he passed by , `` Why , I thought , Jacob , you were ` prentice to the river ; but it seems that you 're bound to the counting-house .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 9]: How long do you mean to sarve ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 28]: `` I do n't know , '' replied I , as I walked away sulkily ; `` but I wish I was out of my time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 15]: `` Very well , sir , I shall report your behaviour to Mr Drummond .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 9]: I 'll make him know your tricks . ''
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 3]: `` Tricks !
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 9]: you wo n't let him know his tricks .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 31]: His duty is to take his trick at the wheel , '' replied old Tom ; `` not to be brought up at your cheating tricks at the desk . ''
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 16]: `` Cheating tricks , you old scoundrel , what do you mean by that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 8]: replied Mr Hodgson , in a rage .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 15]: `` My father means _ ledger_demain , I suppose , '' replied young Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 18]: This repartee from a quarter so little expected sent off the head clerk more wroth than ever .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 28]: `` You seemed to hit him hard there , Tom , '' said his father ; `` but I ca n't say that I understand how . ''
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 32]: `` You 've had me taught to read and write , father , '' replied young Tom ; `` and a ` ter that , a lad may teach himself everything .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 34]: I pick up every day , here and there ; and I never see a thing or a word that I do n't understand but I find out the meaning when I can .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 11]: I picked up that hard word at Bartlemy fair . ''
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 11]: `` And very hard you hit him with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 9]: `` Who would n't to serve a friend ?
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 13]: But mark my words , father , this wo n't last long .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 25]: There 's a squall blowing up , and Jacob , quiet as he seems to be , will show his teeth ere long . ''
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 7]: Tom was correct in his surmise .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 38]: I had not taken my seat at my desk more than a minute , when Mr Hodgson entered , and commenced a tirade of abuse , which my pride could no longer allow me to submit to .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 33]: An invoice , perfectly correct and well-written , which I had nearly completed , he snatched from before me , tore into fragments , and ordered me to write it over again .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 22]: Indignant at this treatment , I refused , and throwing down my pen , looked at him determinedly in the face .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 18]: Irritated at this defiance , he caught up a directory , and threw it at my head .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 16]: No longer able to command myself , I seized a ruler and returned the salute .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 56]: It was whizzing through the air as Mr Drummond entered the room ; and he was just in time to witness Mr Hodgson struck on the forehead and felled to the ground , while I remained with my arm raised , standing upon the cross-bar of my high stool , my face glowing with passion .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 6]: Appearances were certainly against me .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 34]: Assistance was summoned , and the head clerk removed to his chamber , during all which time I remained seated on my stool before the desk , my breast heaving with tumultuous feelings .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 38]: How long I remained there I can not say , it might have been two hours ; feelings long dormant had been aroused , and whirled round and round in a continual cycle in my feverish brains .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 23]: I should have remained probably much longer in this state of absorption , had I not been summoned to attend Mr Drummond .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 56]: It appeared that in the meantime Mr Hodgson had come to his own senses , and had given his own version of the fracas , which had been , to an unjustifiable degree , corroborated by the stupid young clerk , who was no friend of mine , and who sought favour with his principal .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 26]: I walked up to the drawing-room , where I found Mr and Mrs Drummond , and little Sarah , whose eyes were red with crying .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 16]: I entered without any feeling of alarm , my breast was too full of indignation .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 11]: Mrs Drummond looked grave and mournful , Mr Drummond severe .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 33]: `` Jacob Faithful , I have sent for you to tell you that in consequence of your disgraceful conduct to my senior clerk , you can no longer remain under my roof .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 67]: It appears that what I have been a witness to this day has been but a sequel to behaviour equally improper and impertinent ; that so far from having , as I thought , done your duty , you have constantly neglected it ; and that the association you have formed with that drunken old man and his insolent son has led you into this folly .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 23]: You may say that it was not your wish to remain on shore , and that you preferred being on the river .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 44]: At your age it is too often the case that young people consult their wishes rather than their interests ; and it is well for them if they find those who are older , and wished them well , to decide for them .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 40]: I had hoped to have been able to place you in a more respectable situation in society than was my original intention when you were thrown upon me , a destitute orphan ; but I now perceive my error .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 11]: You have proved yourself not only deceitful but ungrateful . ''
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 11]: `` I have not , '' interrupted I , calmly .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 4]: `` You have .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 30]: I have been a witness myself to your impropriety of conduct , which , it appears , has long been concealed from me ; but no more of that .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 24]: I bound you apprentice to the river , and you must now follow up your apprenticeship ; but expect nothing farther from me .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 23]: You must now work your own way up in the world , and I trust that you will reform and do well .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 50]: You may return to the lighter until I can procure you a situation in another craft , for I consider it my duty to remove you from the influence of those who have led you astray , and with the old man and his son you will not remain .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 8]: I have one thing more to say .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 22]: You have been in my counting-house for some months , and you are now about to be thrown upon the world .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 21]: There are ten pounds for your services , '' -LRB- and Mr Drummond laid the money on the table -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 28]: `` You may also recollect that I have some money belonging to you , which has been laid by until you shall be out of your apprenticeship .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 34]: I consider it my duty still to retain that money for you ; as soon as your apprenticeship is expired you may demand it , and it shall be made over to you .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 45]: I trust , sincerely trust , Jacob , that the severe lesson you are now about to receive will bring you to a sense of what is right , and that you will forget the evil counsel you have received from your late companions .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 12]: Do not attempt to justify yourself ; it is useless . ''
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 9]: Mr Drummond then rose and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 41]: I should have replied , had it not been for this last sentence of Mr Drummond 's , which again roused the feeling of indignation , which , in their presence , had been gradually giving way to softer emotions .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 18]: I therefore stood still , and firmly met the glance of Mr Drummond as he passed me .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 9]: My looks were construed into hardness of heart .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 120]: It appeared that Mr Drummond had left the room by previous arrangement , that he might not be supposed to be moved from this purpose , and that Mrs Drummond was then to have talked to me , and to have ascertained how far there was a chance of my pleading guilty , and begging for a mitigation of my sentence ; but the firm composure of innocence was mistaken for defiance ; and the blood mounting to my forehead from a feeling of injustice -- of injustice from those I loved and venerated -- perhaps the most poignant feeling in existence to a sensitive and generous mind -- was falsely estimated as proceeding from impetuous and disgraceful sources .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 35]: Mrs Drummond looked upon me with a mournful face , sighed , and said nothing ; little Sarah watching me with her large black eyes , as if she would read my inmost soul .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 32]: `` Have you nothing to say , Jacob , '' at last observed Mrs Drummond , `` that I can tell Mr Drummond when his anger is not so great ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 20]: `` Nothing , madam , '' replied I , `` except that I 'll try to forgive him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 11]: This reply was offensive even to the mild Mrs Drummond .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 6]: She rose from her chair .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 39]: `` Come , Sarah , '' said she : and she walked out of the room , wishing me , in a kind , soft voice , a `` good-bye , Jacob , '' as she passed me .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 6]: My eyes swam with tears .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 34]: I tried to return the salutation , but I was too much choked by my feelings ; I could not speak , and my silence was again looked upon as contumacy and ingratitude .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 17]: Little Sarah still remained -- she had not obeyed her mother 's injunctions to follow her .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 23]: She was now nearly fourteen years old , and I had known her as a companion and a friend for five years .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 19]: During the last six months that I had resided in the house we had become more intimately acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 25]: I joined her in the evening in all her pursuits , and Mr and Mrs Drummond appeared to take a pleasure in our intimacy .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 15]: I loved her as a dear sister ; my love was based on gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 45]: I had never forgotten her kindness to me when I first came under her father 's roof , and a long acquaintance with the sweetness of her disposition had rendered the attachment so firm , that I felt I could have died for her .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 24]: But I never knew the full extent of the feeling until now that I was about to leave her , perhaps for ever .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 37]: My heart sank when Mr Drummond left the room -- a bitter pang passed through it as the form of Mrs Drummond vanished from my sight ; but now was to be the bitterest of all .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 34]: I felt it , and I remained with the handle of the door in my hand , gasping for breath -- blinded with the tears that coursed each other rapidly down my cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 19]: I remained a minute in this state , when I felt that Sarah touched my other listless hand .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 4]: `` Jacob ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 23]: she would have said , but before half my name was out she burst into tears , and sobbed on my shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 29]: My heart was too much surcharged not to take the infection -- my grief found vent , and I mingled my sobs with those of the affectionate girl .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 32]: When we were more composed , I recounted to her all that had passed , and one , at least , in the world acknowledged that I had been treated unjustly .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 24]: I had but just finished , when the servant interrupted us with a message to Sarah , that her mother desired her presence .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 12]: She threw herself into my arms , and bade me farewell .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 25]: I released her , she hastened to obey her mother , but perceiving the money still upon the table , she pointed to it .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 7]: `` Your money , Jacob ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 10]: `` No Sarah , I will not accept it .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 42]: I would accept of anything from those who treat me kindly , and feel more and more grateful to them ; but that I will not accept -- I can not , and you must not let it be left here .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 9]: Say that I could not take it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 35]: Sarah would have remonstrated , but perceiving that I was firm , and at the same time , perhaps , entering into my feelings , she again bade me farewell , and hastened away .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 14]: The reader may easy imagine that I did not put off my departure .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 41]: I hastened to pack up my clothes , and in less than ten minutes after Sarah had quitted me , I was on board the lighter , with old Tom and his son , who were then going to supper .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 15]: They knew a part of what had happened , and I narrated the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 41]: `` Well , '' replied old Tom , after I had finished my story , `` I did n't know that I have done you any harm , Jacob , and I 'm sorry that Mr Drummond should suppose so .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 139]: I 'm fond of a drop , that 's true ; but I appeals to you , whether I ever force it on you -- and whether I do n't check that boy as much as I can ; but then , d'ye see , although I preach , I do n't practise , that 's the worst of it ; and I know I 've to answer for making Tom so fond of grog ; and though I never says anything about it , I often think to myself , that if Tom should chance to be pressed some of these days , and be punished for being in liquor , he 'll think of his old father , and curse him in his heart , when he eyes the cat flourishing round before it strikes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 64]: `` I 'll curse the cat , father , or the boatswain 's mate , or the officer who complained of me , or the captain who flogs me , or my own folly , but I 'll be hanged if ever I curse you , who have been so kind to me , '' replied Tom , taking his father 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 34]: `` Well , we must hope for the best , my dear boy , '' replied old Tom ; `` but , Jacob , you 've not had fair play , that sartain .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 61]: It 's very true that master did take you as an orphan , and help you to an education ; but that 's no reason why he should take away your free will , and after binding you ` prentice to the river , perch you up on a high stool , and grind your nose down to the desk .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 70]: If so be he was so kind to you only to make you a slave , why , then , there was no kindness at all , in my opinion : and as for punishment without hearing what a man has to say in his own defence -- there 's ne'er a Tartar in the sarvice but would allow a man to speak before he orders him to strip .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 22]: I recollect a story about that in the sarvice , but I 'm in no humour to spin a yarn now .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 26]: Now , you see , Jacob , Master Drummond has done a great deal for you , and now he has undone a great deal !
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 51]: I ca n't pretend to balance the account , but it does appear to me that you do n't owe him much ; for what thanks is there if you take a vessel in tow , and then cast her off , half-way , when she most needs your assistance ?
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 39]: But what hurts me most is his saying that you sha 'n' t stay in the lighter with us ; if you had , you should n't have wanted , as long as pay and pension are forthcoming .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 22]: Never mind -- Tom , my boy , bring out the bottle -- hang care : it killed the cat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 44]: The grog did not , however , bring back old Tom 's spirits ; the evening passed heavily , and we retired to our beds at a seasonable hour , as we were to drop down to the schooner early the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 9]: That night I did not close my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 22]: I ran over , in my mind , all that had occurred , and indignation took full possession of my soul .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 9]: My whole life passed in review before me .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 30]: I travelled back to my former days -- to the time which had been almost obliterated from my memory , when I had navigated the barge with my father .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 33]: Again was the scene of his and my mother 's death presented to my view ; again I saw him disappear , and the column of black smoke ascend to the sky .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 23]: The Dominie , the matron , Marables , and Fleming , the scene in the cabin -- all passed in rapid succession .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 27]: I felt that I had done my duty , and that I had been unjustly treated ; my head ached with tumultuous and long suppressed feelings .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 35]: Reader , I stated that when I was first taken in hand by Mr Drummond I was a savage , although a docile one , to be reclaimed by kindness , and kindness only .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 24]: You may have been surprised at the rapid change which took place in a few years ; that change was produced by kindness .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 30]: The conduct of Mr Drummond , of his amiable wife and daughter , had been all kindness ; the Dominie and the worthy old matron had proved equally beneficent .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 57]: Marables had been kind ; and , although now and then , as in the case of the usher at the school , and Fleming on board the lighter , I had received injuries , still , these were but trifling checks to the uninterrupted series of kindness with which I had been treated by everybody .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 35]: Thus was my nature rapidly formed by a system of kindness assisted by education ; and had this been followed up , in a few years my new character would have been firmly established .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 28]: But the blow was now struck , injustice roused up the latent feelings of my nature , and when I rose the next morning I was changed .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 68]: I do not mean to say that all that precept and education had done for me was overthrown ; but if not overthrown , it was so shaken to the base , so rent from the summit to the foundation , that , at the slightest impulse in a wrong direction , it would have fallen in and left nothing but a mixed chaos of ruined prospects .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 41]: If anything could hold it together it was the kindness and affection of Sarah , to which I would again and again return in my revolving thoughts , as the only bright star to be discovered in my clouded horizon .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 30]: How dangerous , how foolish , how presumptuous it is in adults to suppose that they can read the thoughts and the feelings of those of a tender age !
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 33]: How often has this presumption on their part been the ruin of a young mind , which , if truly estimated and duly fostered , would have blossomed and produced good fruit !
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 99]: The blush of honest indignation is as dark as the blush of guilt , and the paleness of concentrated courage as marked as that of fear , the firmness of conscious innocence is but too often mistaken as the effrontery of hardened vice , and the tears springing from a source of injury , the tongue tied from the oppression of a wounded heart , the trembling and agitation of the little frame convulsed with emotion have often and often been ascribed by prejudging and self-opinionated witnesses to the very opposite passions to those which have produced them .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 50]: Youth should never be judged harshly , and even when judged correctly , should it be in an evil course , may always be reclaimed ; -- those who decide otherwise , and leave it to drift about the world , have to answer for the _ cast-away _ .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINETEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 61]: THE BREACH WIDENED -- I TURN SPORTSMAN , POACHER , AND DESPERADO -- SOME EXCELLENT NOTIONS PROPOUNDED OF COMMON LAW UPON COMMON RIGHTS -- THE COMMON KEEPER UNCOMMONLY SAVAGE -- I WARN HIM OFF -- HE PROPHESIES THAT WE SHALL BOTH COME TO THE GALLOWS -- SOME MEN ARE PROPHETS IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY -- THE MAN RIGHT AFTER ALL .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 3]: `` Hollo !
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 15]: in the lighter there -- I say , you _ lighter boy _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 40]: were words I heard , as I was pacing the deck of the vessel in deep cogitation Tom and his father were both in the cabin ; there could be no doubt but that they were addressed to me .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 20]: I looked up , and perceived the grinning , stupid , sneering face of the young clerk , Gubbins .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 15]: `` Why do n't you answer when you 're called to , heh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 4]: continued the numbskull .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 7]: `` You 're wanted up here !
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 5]: Come up directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 6]: `` Who wants me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 7]: replied I , reddening with anger .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 7]: `` What 's that to you ?
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 13]: Do you mean to obey _ my _ order or not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 58]: `` No , I do not , '' replied I ; `` I 'm not under the orders of such a fool , thank God ; and if you come within my reach , I 'll try if I ca n't break your head , thick as it is , as well as your master 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 13]: The lout disappeared , and I continued to pace up and down .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 19]: As I afterwards discovered , the message was from Mrs Drummond , who requested to speak to me .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 24]: Sarah had communicated the real facts of my case , and Mrs Drummond had been convinced that what I had said was correct .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 35]: She had talked with her husband ; she pointed out to him that my conduct under Mr Tomkins had been so exemplary that there must have been some reason for so sudden a change .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 20]: Sarah had gone down into the counting-house , and obtained the invoice which the senior clerk had torn up .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 27]: The correctness of it established the fact of one part of my assertions , and that nothing but malice could have warranted its having been destroyed .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 40]: Mr Drummond felt more than he chose to acknowledge ; he was now aware that he had been too precipitate ; even my having refused the money assumed a different appearance ; he _ was _ puzzled and mortified .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 12]: Few people like to acknowledge that they have been in error .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 24]: Mr Drummond , therefore , left his wife to examine further into the matter , and gave her permission to send for me .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 13]: The message given , and the results of it have been stated .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 65]: The answer returned was that I would not come , and that I had threatened to break the clerk 's head as well as that of Mr Drummond ; for although the scoundrel knew very well that in making use of the word `` master , '' I referred to the senior clerk , he thought it proper to substitute that of Mr Drummond .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 10]: The effect of this reply may easily be imagined .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 26]: Sarah was astonished , Mrs Drummond shocked , and Mr Drummond was almost pleased to find that he could not have been in the wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 16]: Thus was the breach made even wider than before , and all communication broken off .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 11]: Much depends in this world upon messages being correctly given .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 54]: In half-an-hour we had hauled out of the tier and dropped down to the American schooner , to take out a cargo of flour , which old Tom had directions to land at the Battersea wharf ; so that I was , for the time , removed from the site of my misfortune .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 19]: I can not say that I felt happy , but I certainly felt glad that I was away .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 10]: I was reckless to a degree that was insupportable .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 27]: I had a heavy load on my mind which I could not shake off -- a prey upon my spirits -- a disgust at almost everything .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 30]: How well do I recollect with what different feelings I looked upon the few books which Mr Drummond and the Dominie had given me to amuse my leisure hours .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 16]: I turned from them with contempt , and thought I would never open them again .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 71]: I felt as if all ties were now cut off , and that I was again wedded to the Thames ; my ideas , my wishes , extended no farther , and I surveyed the river and its busy scene as I did before I had been taken away from it , as if all my energies , all my prospects were in future to be bounded by its shores .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 22]: In the course of four-and-twenty hours a revulsion had taken place , which again put me on the confines of barbarism .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 42]: My bargemates were equally dull as I was ; they were too partial to me , and had too much kindness of heart , not to feel my situation , and anger at the injustice with which I had been treated .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 12]: Employment , however , for a time relieved our melancholy thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 19]: Our cargo was on board of the lighter , and we were again tiding it through the bridges .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 34]: We dropped our anchor above Putney Bridge a little after twelve o'clock , and young Tom , with the wish of amusing me , proposed that we should go on shore and walk .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 22]: do my lads , do -- it will do you good , Jacob ; no use moping here a whole tide .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 9]: I 'll take care of the ` barkey .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 17]: Mind you make the boat well fast , and take the sculls into the public-house there .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 22]: I 'll have the supper under weigh when you come back , and then we 'll have a night o n't .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 30]: It 's a poor heart that never rejoices ; and , Tom , take a bottle on shore , get it filled , and bring it off with you .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 5]: Here 's the money .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 10]: But I say , Tom , honour bright . ''
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 31]: `` Honour bright , father ; '' and to do Tom justice , he always kept his promise , especially after the word had passed of `` honour bright . ''
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 20]: Had there been gallons of spirits under his charge he would not have tasted a drop after that pledge .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 27]: `` Haul up the boat , Jacob , quick , '' said Tom , as his father went into the cabin to fetch an empty bottle .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 28]: Tom hastened down below forward and brought up an old gun , which he put under the stern sheets before his father came out on the deck .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 17]: We then received the bottle from him , and Tom called out for the dog Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 12]: `` Why , you 're not going to take the dog .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 7]: What 's the use of that ?
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 15]: I want him here to keep watch with me , '' said old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 3]: `` Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 16]: father ; why ca n't you let the poor devil have a run on shore ?
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 19]: He wants to eat grass , I am sure , for I watched him this day or two .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 8]: We shall be back before dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 13]: `` Well , well , just as you please , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 11]: Tommy jumped into the boat , and away we went .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 12]: `` And now , Tom , what are you after ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 14]: said I , as soon as we were ten yards from the lighter .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 36]: `` A'ter , Jacob , going to have a little shooting on Wimbledon Common ; but father ca n't bear to see a gun in my hand , because I once shot my old mother .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 27]: I did pepper her , sure enough ; her old flannel petticoat was full of shot , but it was so thick that it saved her .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 8]: Are you anything of a shot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 10]: `` Never fired a gun in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 24]: `` Well , then , we 'll fire in turns , and toss up , if you like , for first shot . ''
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 56]: We landed , carried the sculls up to the public-house , and left the bottle to be filled , and then , with Tommy bounding before us , and throwing about his bushy tail with delight , ascended Putney Hill , and arrived at the Green Man public-house , at the corner of Wimbledon Common .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 12]: `` I wonder where green men are to be found ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 26]: observed Tom , laughing ; `` I suppose they live in the same country with the _ blue _ dogs my father speaks about sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 10]: Now , then , its time to load . ''
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 33]: The bowl of a tobacco pipe , full of powder , was then inserted , with an equal dose of shot , and all being ready we were soon among the furze .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 22]: A half penny decided it was my first shot , and fate further decided that a water-wagtail should be the mark .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 46]: I took good aim , as I thought , at least I took sufficient time , for I followed him with the muzzle of the gun for three or four minutes at least , as he ran to and fro ; at last I fired .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 11]: Tommy barked with delight , and the bird flew away .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 22]: `` I think I must have hit it , '' said I ; `` I saw it wag its tail . ''
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 14]: `` More proof of a miss than a hit , '' replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 15]: `` Had you hit it he 'd never have wagged his tail again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 15]: `` Never mind , '' said I , `` better luck next time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 20]: Tom then knocked a blackbird off a furze bush , and loading the gun , handed it to me .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 41]: I was more successful than before ; a cock sparrow , three yards distant , yielded to the prowess of my arm , and I never felt more happy in my life than in this first successful attempt at murder .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 33]: Gaily did we trudge over the common , sometimes falling in with gravel-pits half full of water , at others bogs and swampy plains , which obliged us to make a circuit .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 17]: The gun was fired again and again ; but our game-bag did not fill very fast .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 38]: However , if we were not quite so well pleased when we missed as when we hit , Tommy was , every shot being followed up with a dozen bounds , and half a minute 's barking .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 21]: At last we began to feel tired , and agreed to repose a while in a cluster of furze bushes .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 18]: We sat down , pulled out our game , and spread it in a row before us .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 16]: It consisted of two sparrows , one greenfinch , one blackbird , and three tomtits .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 18]: All of a sudden we heard a rustling in the furze , and then a loud squeal .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 43]: It was the dog , who , scenting something , had forced its way into the bush , and had caught a hare , which having been wounded in the loins by some other sportsman , had dragged itself there to die .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 42]: In a minute we had taken possession of it , much to the annoyance of Tommy , who seemed to consider that there was no co-partnership in the concern , and would not surrender his prize until after sundry admonitory kicks .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 15]: When we had fairly beaten him off we were in an ecstasy of delight .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 34]: We laid the animal out between us , and were admiring it from the ear to the tip of his tail , when we were suddenly saluted with a voice close to us .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 19]: `` Oh , you blam 'd young poachers , so I 've caught you , have I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 9]: We looked up , and beheld the common-keeper .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 21]: `` Come -- come along with me ; we 've a nice clink at Wandsworth to lock you up in .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 11]: I 've been looking a ` rter you some time .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 6]: Hand your gun here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 37]: `` I should rather think not , '' replied I. `` The gun belongs to us , and not to you ; '' and I caught up the gun , and presented the muzzle at him .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 7]: do you mean to commit murder ?
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 7]: Why , you young villains ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 10]: `` Do you want to commit a robbery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 17]: retorted I , fiercely ; `` because if you do , I mean to commit murder .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 5]: Then I shoot him .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 3]: Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 33]: `` No , Jacob , no ; you must n't shoot men , '' replied Tom , who perceived that I was in a humour to keep my word with the common-keeper .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 23]: `` Indeed , you ca n't , '' continued he , whispering to me ; `` the gun 's not loaded . ''
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 14]: `` Do you mean to refuse to give me up your gun ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 4]: repeated the man .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 19]: `` Yes I do , '' replied I , cocking the lock ; `` so keep off . ''
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 17]: you young reprobates -- you 'll come to the gallows before long , that 's certain .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 9]: Do you refuse to come with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 18]: `` I should rather think we do , '' replied I. `` You refuse , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 20]: Recollect I 've caught you in the fact , poaching , with a dead hare in your possession . ''
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 11]: `` Well , it 's no use crying about it .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 52]: What 's done ca n't be helped , '' replied I. `` Do n't you know that all the game , and all the turf , and all the bog , and all the gravel , and all the furze on this common belong to the Right Honourable Earl Spencer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 26]: `` And all the blackbirds , and all the greenfinches , and all the sparrows , and all the tomtits too , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 14]: replied I. `` To be sure they do -- and I 'm common-keeper .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 11]: Now you 'll give me up that hare immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 27]: `` Look you , '' replied Tom , `` we did n't kill that hare , the dog caught it , and it is his property .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 9]: We sha 'n' t interfere in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 13]: If Tommy chooses to let you have it , well and good .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 52]: Here , Tommy , this here gentleman says , '' -LRB- and Tom pointed to the keeper -RRB- `` that this hare , '' -LRB- and Tom pointed to the hare -RRB- `` is not yours ; now will you ` watch it , ' or let him have it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 35]: At the word ` watch it , ' Tommy laid down with his fore-paws over the hare , and showing a formidable set of ivories , looked fiercely at the man , and growled .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 23]: `` You see what he says ; now you may do as you please , '' continued Tom , addressing the man .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 41]: `` Yes -- very well -- you 'll come to the gallows , I see that ; but I 'll just go and fetch half-a-dozen men to help me , and then we 'll have you both in gaol . ''
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 17]: `` Then , be smart , '' replied I , jumping up and levelling the gun .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 21]: Tommy jumped up also to fly at the man , but Tom caught him by the neck and restrained him .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 35]: The common-keeper took to his heels , and as soon as he was out of gun-shot , turned round , shook his fist , and then hastened away to obtain the reinforcement he desired .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 23]: `` I wish the gun had been loaded , '' said I. `` Why , Jacob , what 's come over you ?
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 7]: Would you have fired at him ?
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 15]: The man is only doing his duty -- we have no business here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 23]: `` I think otherwise , '' replied I. `` A hare on a common is as much mine as Lord Spencer 's .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 7]: A common belongs to everybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 49]: `` That 's my opinion , too ; but , nevertheless , if he gets hold of us , he 'll have us in gaol ; and therefore I propose we make off as fast as we can in the opposite way to which he is gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 51]: We started accordingly , and as the keeper proceeded in the direction of Wandsworth , we took the other direction ; but it so happened that on turning round , after a quarter of an hour 's walk , we perceived the man coming back with three or four others .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 18]: `` We must run for it , '' cried Tom , `` and then hide ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 49]: After ten minutes ' hard run we descended into a hollow and swampy place , looking round to see if they could perceive us , and finding that they were not in sight , we plunged into a thick cluster of furze bushes , which completely concealed us .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 9]: Tommy followed us , and there we lay .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 22]: `` Now they never will find us , '' said Tom , `` if I can only keep the dog quiet .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 5]: Lie down , Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 7]: Watch , and lie down . ''
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 16]: The dog appeared to understand what was required ; he lay between us perfectly still .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 11]: We had remained there about half-an-hour when we heard voices .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 18]: I motioned to Tom to give me the powder to load the gun , but he refused .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 11]: The voices came nearer ; Tommy gave a low growl .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 8]: Tom held his mouth with his hands .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 48]: At last they were close to the bushes , and we heard the common-keeper say , `` They never went over the hill , that 's for certain , the little wagrants ; they ca n't be far off -- they must be down in the hollow .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 4]: Come along . ''
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 36]: `` But I 'm blessed if I 'm not up to my knees in the bog , '' cried one of the men ; `` I 'll go no further down , dang me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 27]: `` Well , then let 's try the side of the bog , '' replied the keeper , `` I 'll show you the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 38]: And the voices retreated , fortunately for us , for there had been a continual struggle between us and the dog for the last minute , I holding his forepaws , and Tom jamming up his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 14]: We were now all quiet again , but dare not leave our hiding-place .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 29]: We remained there for half-an-hour , when it became nearly dark , and the sky , which had been quite clear when we set out , clouded over .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 30]: Tom put up his head , looked all round , and perceiving nobody , proposed that we should return as fast as we could ; to which I agreed .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 35]: But we were scarcely clear of the furze in which we had been concealed when a heavy fall of snow commenced , which , with the darkness , prevented us from distinguishing our way .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 22]: Every minute the snow-storm increased , the wind rose , and hurled the flakes into our faces until we were blinded .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 26]: Still we made good way against it , and expected every minute to be on the road , after which our task would be easy .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 25]: On we walked in silence , I carrying the gun , Tom with the hare over his shoulder , and Tommy at our heels .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 20]: For upwards of an hour did we tread our way through the furze , but could find no road .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 30]: Above us all was dark as pitch ; the wind howled ; our clothes were loaded with snow ; and we began to feel no inconsiderable degree of fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 10]: At last , quite tired out , we stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 19]: `` Tom , '' said I , `` I 'm sure we 've not kept a straight course .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 31]: The wind was on our starboard side , and our clothes were flaked with snow on that side , and now you see we 've got it in our quarter .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 8]: What the devil shall we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 20]: `` We must go on till we fall in with something , at all events , '' replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 26]: `` And I expect that will be a gravel-pit , '' replied I ; `` but never mind , ` better luck next time . '
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 12]: I only wish I had that rascal of a common-keeper here .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 28]: Suppose we turn back again , and keep the wind on the starboard side of us as before ; we must pitch upon something at last . ''
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 51]: We did so , but our difficulties increased every moment ; we floundered in the bogs , we tumbled over the stumps of the cut furze , and had I not caught bold of Tom as he was sliding down he would have been at the bottom of a gravel-pit .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 36]: This obliged us to alter our course , and we proceeded for a quarter of an hour , in another direction , until , worn out with cold and fatigue , we began to despair .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 22]: `` This will never do , Tom , '' said I , as the wind rose and roared with double fury .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 20]: `` I think we had better get into the furze , and wait till the storm is over . ''
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 19]: Tom 's teeth chattered with the cold ; but before he could reply , they chattered with fear .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 9]: We heard a loud scream _ overhead _ .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 6]: `` What was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 3]: cried he .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 11]: I confess that I was as much alarmed as Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 12]: The scream was repeated , and it had an unearthly sound .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 15]: It was no human voice -- it was between a scream and a creak .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 12]: Again it was repeated , and carried along with the gale .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 36]: I mustered up courage sufficient to look up to where the sound proceeded from ; but the darkness was so intense , and the snow blinded me so completely , that I could see nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 30]: Again and again did the dreadful sound ring in our ears , and we remained fixed and motionless with horror ; even the dog crouched at our feet trembling .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 66]: We spoke not a word -- neither of us moved ; the gun had fallen from my hand ; the hare lay at Tom 's feet ; we held each other 's hand in silence , and there we remained for more than a quarter of an hour , every moment more and more sinking under the effects of cold , fatigue , and horror .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 66]: Fortunately for us the storm , in which had it continued much longer we should , in all probability , have perished , was by that time over ; the snow ceased to fall ; the clouds were rolled away to leeward ; and a clear sky , bespangled with a thousand twinkling lights , roused us from our state of bodily and mental suffering .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 16]: The first object which caught my eye was a post within two yards of us .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 30]: I looked at it , followed it up with my eyes , and , to my horror , beheld a body suspended and swinging in chains over our heads .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 27]: As soon as I recovered from the shock which the first view occasioned , I pointed it out to Tom , who had not yet moved .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 32]: He looked up , started back , and fell over the dog -- jumped up again , and burst out into as loud a laugh as his frozen jaws would permit .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 26]: `` It 's old Jerry Abershaw , '' said he , `` I know him well , and now I know where we are . ''
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 45]: This was the case ; Abershaw had , about three years before , been hung in chains on Wimbledon Common ; and the unearthly sound we had heard was the creaking of the rusty iron as the body was swung to-and-fro by the gale .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 37]: `` All 's right , Jacob , '' said Tom , looking up at the brilliant sky , and then taking up the hare , `` we 'll be on the road in five minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 10]: I shouldered the gun , and off we set .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 38]: `` By the Lord , that rascally common-keeper was right , '' continued Tom , as we renewed our steps ; `` he prophesied we should come to the gallows before long , and so we have .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 10]: Well , this has been a pretty turn out .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 9]: Father will be in a precious stew . ''
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 22]: `` Better luck next time , Tom , '' replied I ; `` it 's all owing to that turf-and-bog rascal .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 8]: I wish we had him here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 11]: `` Why , what would you do with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 23]: `` Take down old Abershaw , and hang him up in his place , as sure as my name 's Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWENTY .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 51]: OUR LAST ADVENTURE NOT FATAL -- TAKE TO MY GROG KINDLY -- GROG MAKES ME A VERY UNKIND RETURN -- OLD TOM AT HIS YARNS AGAIN -- HOW TO PUT YOUR FOOT IN A MISCHIEF , WITHOUT HAVING A HAND IN IT -- CANDIDATES FOR THE CAT-O ' - NINE-TAILS .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 42]: We soon recovered the road , and in half-an-hour we were at Putney Bridge ; cold , wet , and tired , but not so bad as when we were stationary under the gallows ; the quick walking restored the circulation .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 38]: Tom went in for the bottle of spirits , while I went for the sculls and carried them down to the boat , which was high and dry , and nearly up to the thwarts with snow .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 14]: When Tom joined me , he appeared with two bottles under his arms .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 36]: `` I have taken another upon tick , Jacob , '' said he , `` for I 'm sure we want it , and so will father say , when he hears our story . ''
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 26]: We launched our boat , and in a couple of minutes were close to the lighter , on the deck of which stood old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 4]: `` Boat ahoy !
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 7]: is that you , lads ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 3]: cried he .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 20]: `` Yes , father , all 's right , '' replied Tom , as we laid in our oars .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 5]: `` Thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 5]: replied the old man .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 10]: `` Boys , boys , how you frightened me ?
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 5]: where have you been ?
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 9]: I thought you had met with some disaster .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 32]: How have I been peeping through the snow-storm these last two hours , watching for the boat , and I 'm as wet as a shag and as cold as charity .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 6]: What has been the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 9]: Did you bring the bottle , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 47]: `` Yes , father ; brought two , for we shall want them to-night if we go without for a week ; but we must all get on dry rigging as fast as possible , and then you shall have the story of our cruise . ''
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 30]: In a few minutes we had changed our wet clothes and were seated at the cabin-table , eating our supper , and narrating our adventures to the old man .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 29]: Tommy , poor fellow , had his share , and now lay snoring at our feet , as the bottles and pannikins were placed upon the little table .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 24]: `` Come , Jacob , a drop will do you good , '' said old Tom , filling me one of the pannikins .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 45]: `` A'ter all , it 's much better being snug here in this little cabin than shivering with fear and cold under old Abershaw 's gallows ; and Tom , you scamp , if ever you go gunning again I 'll disinherit you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 16]: `` What have you got to leave , father , except your wooden legs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 3]: replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 14]: `` Your 's would be but a _ wooden-leg _ - acy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 18]: `` How do you know but what I can ` _ post the coal _ ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 26]: `` So you will , if I boil a pot o ' ` tatoes with your legacy -- but it will only be char-coal . ''
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 41]: `` Well , I believe you are about right , Tom ; still , somehow or other , the old woman always picks out a piece or two of gold when I 'm rather puzzled how to raise the wind .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 9]: I never keeps no ` count with her .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 35]: If I follow my legs before she , I hope the old soul will have saved something ; for you know when a man goes to kingdom come , his pension goes with him .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 26]: However , let me only hold on another five years , and then you 'll not see her want ; will you , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 34]: `` No , father ; I 'll sell myself to the king , and stand to be shot at , at a shilling a day , and give the old woman half . ''
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 35]: `` Well , Tom , 't is but natural for a man to wish to serve his country ; so here 's to you , my lad , and may you never do worse !
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 14]: Jacob , do you think of going on board of a man-of-war ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 20]: `` I 'd like to serve my apprenticeship first , and then I do n't care how soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 28]: `` Well , my boy , you 'll meet more fair play on board of a king 's ship than you have from those on shore . ''
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 12]: `` I should hope so , '' replied I , bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 16]: `` I hope to see you a man before I die , yet , Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 20]: I shall very soon be laid up in ordinary -- my toes pain me a good deal lately ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 5]: `` Your toes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 8]: cried Tom and I both at once .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 37]: `` Yes , boys ; you may think it odd , but sometimes I feel them just as plain as if they were now on , instead of being long ago in some shark 's maw .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 18]: At nights I has the cramp in them till it almost makes me halloo out with pain .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 23]: It 's a hard thing , when one has lost the sarvice of his legs , that all the feelings should remain .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 9]: The doctor says as how it 's narvous .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 9]: Come , Jacob , shove in your pannikin .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 12]: You seem to take it more kindly than you did . ''
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 16]: `` Yes , '' replied I , `` I begin to like grog now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 19]: The _ now _ , however , might be comprehended within the space of the last twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 28]: My depressed spirits were raised with the stimulus , and for a time I got rid of the eternal current of thought which pressed upon my brain .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 30]: `` I wonder what your old gentleman , the Dominie , as you call him , thought , after he got on shore again , '' said old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 9]: `` He seemed to be mighty cut up .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 12]: I suppose you 'll give him a hail , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 26]: `` No , '' replied I , `` I shall not go near him , nor any one else , if I can help it .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 12]: Mr Drummond may think I wish to make it up again .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 7]: I 've done with the shore .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 27]: I only wish I knew what is to become of me ; for you know I am not to serve in the lighter with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 13]: `` Suppose Tom and I look out for another craft , Jacob ?
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 7]: I care nothing for Mr Drummond .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 25]: He said t ` other day I was a drunken old swab -- for which , with my sarvice to him , he lies .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 35]: A drunken fellow is one who ca n't , for the soul of him , keep from liquor when he can get it , and who 's overtaken before he is aware of it .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 55]: Now that 's not the case with me ; I keep sober when there 's work to be done ; and when I knows that everything is safe under hatches , and no fear of nothing , why then I gets drunk like a rational being , with my eyes open -- 'cause why ?
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 6]: -- 'cause I chooses . ''
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 30]: `` That 's exactly my notion of the thing , '' observed Tom , draining his pannikin , and handing it over to his father for a fresh supply .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 43]: `` Mind you keep to that notion , Tom , when you gets in the king 's sarvice , that 's all ; or you 'll be sure to have your back scratched , which I understand is no joke after all .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 25]: Yet I do remember once , in a ship I was in , when half-a-dozen fellows were all fighting who should be flogged . ''
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 18]: `` Pray give us that yarn , father ; but before you begin just fill my pannikin .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 15]: I shoved it over half-an-hour ago , just by way of a hint . ''
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 25]: `` Well then , '' said old Tom , pouring out some spirits into Tom 's pannikin , `` it was just as follows .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 54]: It was when the ship was lying at anchor in Bermuda harbour , that the purser sent a breaker of spirits on shore to be taken up to some lady 's house whom he was very anxious to splice , and I suppose that he found a glass of grog helped the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 86]: Now , there were about twenty of the men who had liberty to go on shore , to stretch their limbs -- little else could they do , poor fellows for the first lieutenant looked sharp after their kits to see that they did not sell any of their rigging ; and as for money , we had been five years without touching a farthing of pay , and I do n't suppose there was a matter of threepence among the men before the mast .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 36]: However , liberty 's liberty after all ; and if they could n't go ashore and get glorious , rather than not go on shore at all , they went ashore and kept sober perforce .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 103]: I do think , myself , it 's a very bad thing to keep the seamen without a farthing for so long -- for you see a man who will be very honest with a few shillings in his pocket is often tempted to help himself , just for the sake of getting a glass or two of grog , and the temptation 's very great , that 's sartain , ` ticularly in a hot climate , when the sun scorches you , and the very ground itself is so heated that you can hardly bear the naked foot to it .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 39]: -LSB- _ This has been corrected ; the men have for some time received a portion of their pay on foreign stations , and this portion has been greatly increased during Sir James Graham 's administration _ . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 5]: But to go on .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 51]: The yawl was ordered on shore for the liberty men , and the purser gives this breaker , which was at least half full , and I dare say there might be three gallons in it , under my charge as coxswain , to deliver to madam at the house .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 22]: Well , as soon as we landed , I shoulders the breaker , and starts with it up the hill . ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 9]: ` What have you there , Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 5]: said Bill Short . ''
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 47]: ` What I wish I could share with you , Bill , ' says I ; ` it 's some of old Nipcheese 's _ eights _ , that he has sent on shore to bowse his jib up with , with his sweetheart . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 44]: ` I 've seen the madam , ' said Holmes to me -- for you see all the liberty men were walking up the hill at the same time -- ` and I 'd rather make love to the breaker than to her .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 30]: She 's as fat as an ox , as broad as she 's long , built like a Dutch schuyt , and as yellow as a nabob . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 51]: ` But old Tummings knows what he 's about , ' said a Scotch lad of the name of M'Alpine ; ` they say she has lots of gold dust , more ducks and ingons , and more inches of water in her tank than any on the island . '
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 65]: `` You see , boys , Bermuda be a queer sort of place , and water very scarce ; all they get there is a Godsend , as it comes from Heaven ; and they look sharp for the rain , which is collected in large tanks , and an inch or two more of water in the tank is considered a great catch .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 20]: I 've often heard the ladies there talking for a shower : -- '' ` Good morning , marm .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 10]: How do you do this fine morning ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 10]: ` Pretty well , I tank you , marm .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 8]: Charming shower hab last night . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 13]: ` Yes , so all say ; but me not very lucky .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 7]: Cloud not come over my tank .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 14]: How many inches of water you get last night , marm ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 23]: ` I get good seven inches , and I tink a little bit more , which make me very happy . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 29]: ` Me no so lucky , marm ; so help me God , me only get four inches of water in my tank ; and dat nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 17]: `` Well , but I 've been yawing again , so now to keep my course .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 33]: As soon as I came to the house I knocked at the door , and a little black girl opens the jalousies , and put her finger to her thick lips . ''
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 10]: ` No make noise ; missy sleep . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 10]: ` Where am I to put this ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 37]: ` Put down there ; by-and-by I come fetch it ; ' and then she closed the jalousies , for fear her mistress should be woke up , and she get a hiding , poor devil .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 18]: So I puts the breaker down at the door , and walks back to the boat again .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 38]: Now , you see , these liberty men were all by when I spoke to the girl , and seeing the liquor left with no one to guard it , the temptation was too strong for them .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 28]: So they looked all about them , and then at one another , and caught one another 's meaning by the eye ; but they said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 19]: ` I 'll have no hand in it , ' at last says one , and walked away .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 13]: ` Nor I , ' said another , and walked away too .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 59]: At last all of them walked away except eight , and then Bill Short walks up to the breaker and says -- '' ` I wo n't have no _ hand _ in it , either ; ' but he gave the breaker a kick , which rolls it away two or three yards from the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 24]: ` Nor more will I , ' said Holmes , giving the breaker another kick , which rolled it out in the road .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 31]: So they all went on , without having a _ hand _ in it , sure enough , till they had kicked the breaker down the hill to the beach .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 16]: Then they were at a dead stand , as no one would spile the breaker .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 49]: At last a black carpenter came by , and they offered him a glass if he would bore a hole with his gimlet , for they were determined to be able to swear , every one of them ; that they had _ no hand in it _ .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 59]: Well , as soon as the hole was bored , one of them borrowed a couple of little mugs from a black woman , who sold beer , and then they let it run , the black carpenter shoving one mug under as soon as the other was full , and they drinking as fast as they could .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 72]: Before they had half finished , more of the liberty men came down ; I suppose they scented the good stuff from above as a shark does anything in the water , and they soon made a finish of it ; and when it was all finished , they were all drunk , and made sail for a cruise , that they might not be found too near the empty breaker .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 50]: Well , a little before sunset I was sent on shore with the boat to fetch off the liberty men , and the purser takes this opportunity of getting ashore to see his madam , and the first thing he falls athwart of is his own empty breaker . ''
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 6]: ` How 's this ? '
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 18]: says he ; ` did n't you take this breaker up as I ordered you ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 44]: ` Yes , sir , ' replied I , ` I did , and gave it in charge to the little back thing ; but madam was asleep , and the girl did not allow me to put it inside the door . '
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 38]: At that he began to storm , and swore that he 'd find out the malefactors , as he termed the liberty men , who had emptied his breaker ; and away he went to the house .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 23]: As soon as he was gone we got hold of the breaker , and made a _ bull _ of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 8]: `` How did you manage that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 64]: inquired I. `` Why , Jacob , a _ bull _ means putting a quart or two of water into a cask which has had spirits in it ; and what with the little that may be left , and what has soaked in the wood , if you roll it and shake it well , it generally turns out pretty fair grog .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 9]: At all events its always better than nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 41]: Well , to go on -- but suppose we fill up again and take a fresh departure , as this is a tolerably long yarn , and I must wet the threads , or they may chance to break . ''
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 18]: Our pannikins , which had been empty , were all replenished , and then old Tom proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 34]: `` It was a long while before we could pick up the liberty men , who were reeling about every corner of the town , and quite dark before I came on board .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 32]: The first lieutenant was on deck , and had no occasion to ask me why I waited so long , when he found they were all lying in the stern sheets .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 13]: ` Where the devil could they have picked up the liquor ? '
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 20]: said he , and then he ordered the master-at-arms to keep them under the half-deck till they were sober .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 23]: The next morning the purser comes off , and makes his complaint on the quarter-deck as how somebody had stolen his liquor .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 22]: The first lieutenant reports to the captain , and the captain orders up all the men who came off tipsy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 9]: ` Which of you took the liquor ? '
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 11]: They all swore that they had no hand in it .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 8]: ` Then how did you get tipsy ?
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 23]: Come now , Mr Short , answer me ; you came off beastly drunk -- who gave you the liquor ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 31]: ` A black fellow , sir , ' replied Short ; which was true enough , as the mugs were filled by the black carpenter , and handed by him .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 30]: `` Well , they all swore the same , and then the captain got into a rage , and ordered them all to be put down on the report .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 41]: The next day the hands were turned up for punishment , and the captain said , ` Now , my lads , if you wo n't tell who stole the purser 's grog , I will flog you all round .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 34]: I only want to flog those who committed the theft , for it is too much to expect of seamen that they would refuse a glass of grog when offered to them . '
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 20]: `` Now , Short and the others had a parley together , and they had agreed how to act .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 17]: They knew that the captain could not bear flogging , and was a very kind-hearted man .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 44]: So Bill Short steps out , and says , touching his forelock to the captain , ` If you please , sir , if all must be flogged if nobody will peach , I think it better to tell the truth at once .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 10]: It was I who took the liquor . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 17]: ` Very well , then , ' said the captain ; ` strip , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 13]: So Bill Short pulls off his shirt , and is seized up .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 18]: ` Boatswain 's mate , ' said the captain , ` give him a dozen . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 51]: ` Beg your honour 's pardon , ' said Jack Holmes , stepping out of the row of men brought out for punishment ; ` but I ca n't bear to see an innocent man punished , and since one must be flogged , it must be the right one .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 23]: It war n't Bill Short that took the liquor ; it was I. ' '' ` Why , how 's this ? '
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 20]: said the captain ; ` did n't you own that you took the liquor , Mr Short ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 39]: ` Why , yes , I did say so , 'cause I did n't wish to see _ everybody _ flogged -- but the truth 's the truth , and I had no hand in it . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 14]: ` Cast him loose -- Holmes , you 'll strip , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 7]: Holmes stripped and was tied up .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 37]: ` Give him a dozen , ' said the captain ; when out steps M'Alpine , and swore it was him , and not Holmes ; and ax 'd leave to be flogged in his stead .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 19]: At which the captain bit his lips to prevent laughing , and then they knew all was right .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 25]: So another came forward , and says it was him , and not M'Alpine ; and another contradicts him again , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 40]: At last the captain says , ` One would think flogging was a very pleasant affair ; you are all so eager to be tied up ; but , however , I sha n't flog , to please you .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 16]: I shall find out who the real culprit is , and then punish him severely .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 23]: In the meantime , you keep them all on the report , Mr P -- , ' speaking to the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 23]: ` Depend upon it , I 'll not let you off , although I do not choose to flog innocent men . '
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 36]: So they piped down , and the first lieutenant , who knew that the captain never meant to take any more notice of it , never made no inquiries , and the thing blew over .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 24]: One day , a month or two after , I told the officers how it was managed , and they laughed heartily . ''
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 34]: We continued our carouse till a late hour , old Tom constantly amusing us with his long yarns ; and that night , for the first time , I went to bed intoxicated .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 48]: Old Tom and his son assisted me into my bed-place , old Tom observing , `` Poor Jacob ; it will do him good ; his heart was heavy , and now he 'll forget it all , for a little time , at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 20]: `` Well but , father , I do n't like to see Jacob drunk , '' replied young Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 38]: `` It 's not like him -- it 's not worthy of him ; as for you or me , it 's nothing at all ; but I feel Jacob was never meant to be a toper .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 26]: I never saw a lad so altered in a short time , and I expect bad will come of it when he leaves us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 34]: I awoke , as might be supposed , after my first debauch , with a violent headache , but I had also a fever , brought on by my previous anxiety of mind .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 19]: I rose , dressed , and went on deck , where the snow was nearly a foot deep .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 17]: It now froze hard , and the river was covered with small pieces of floating ice .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 13]: I rubbed my burning forehead with the snow , and felt relief .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 31]: For some time I assisted Tom to heave it overboard , but the fever pressed upon me , and in less than half-an-hour I could no longer stand the exertion .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 17]: I sat down on the water cask , and pressed my hands to my throbbing temples .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 9]: `` You are not well , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 21]: inquired Tom , coming up to me with the shovel in his hand , and glowing with health and exercise .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 21]: `` I am not , indeed , Tom , '' replied I ; `` feel how hot I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 43]: Tom went to his father , who was in the cabin , padding , with extra flannel , his stumps , to defend them from the cold , which always made him suffer much , and then led me into the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 19]: It was with much difficulty I could walk ; my knees trembled , and my eyesight was defective .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 12]: Old Tom took my hand as I sank on the locker .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 14]: `` Do you think that it was taking too much last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 6]: inquired Tom of his father .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 20]: `` There 's more here than a gallon of liquor would have brought about , '' replied old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 10]: `` No , no -- I see it all .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 8]: Go to bed again , Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 36]: They put me into bed , and I was soon in a state of stupor , in which I remained until the lighter had arrived at the Brentford Wharf , and for many days afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 61]: ON A SICK BED -- FEVER , FIRMNESS , AND FOLLY -- `` BOUND ` PRENTICE TO A WATERMAN '' -- I TAKE MY FIRST LESSON IN LOVE , AND GIVE MY FIRST LESSON IN LATIN -- THE LOVE LESSON MAKES AN IMPRESSION ON MY AURICULAR ORGAN -- VERILY , NONE ARE SO DEAF AS THOSE WHO WO N'T HEAR .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 20]: When I recovered my senses , I found myself in bed , and Captain Turnbull sitting by my side .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 16]: I had been removed to his house when the lighter had arrived at the wharf .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 18]: Captain Turnbull was then talking with Mr Tomkins , the former head clerk , now in charge .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 42]: Old Tom came on shore and stated the condition I was in , and Mr Tomkins having no spare bed in his house , Captain Turnbull immediately ordered me to be taken to his residence , and sent for medical advice .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 70]: During the time I had remained in this state old Tom had informed Captain Turnbull , the Dominie , and Mr Tomkins of the circumstances which had occurred , and how much I had been misrepresented to Mr Drummond ; and not saying a word about the affair of Wimbledon Common , or my subsequent intemperance , had given it as his opinion that ill-treatment had produced the fever .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 27]: In this , I believe , he was nearly correct , although my disease might certainly have been aggravated and hastened by those two unmentioned causes .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 30]: They all of them took my part , and Mr Turnbull went to London to state my condition to Mr Drummond , and also to remonstrate at his injustice .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 28]: Circumstances had since occurred which induced Mr Drummond to lend a ready ear to my justification ; but the message I had sent was still an obstacle .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 77]: This , however , was partly removed by the equivocating testimony of the young clerk , when he was interrogated by Captain Turnbull and Mr Drummond ; and wholly so by the evidence of young and old Tom , who , although in the cabin , had overheard the whole of the conversation ; and Mr Drummond desired Captain Turnbull to inform me , as soon as I recovered , that all was forgotten and forgiven .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 40]: It might have been on his part , but not on mine ; and when Captain Turnbull told me so , with the view of raising my spirits , I shook my head as I lay on the pillow .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 61]: As the reader will have observed , the feeling roused in me by the ill-usage I had received was a _ vindictive _ one -- one that must have been deeply implanted in my heart , although , till then , it had never been roused into action , and now , once roused , was not to be suppressed .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 19]: That it was based on pride was evident , and with it my pride was raised in proportion .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 16]: To the intimation of Captain Turnbull , I , therefore , gave a decided dissent .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 70]: `` No , sir , I can not return to Mr Drummond : that he was kind to me , and that I owe much to his kindness , I readily admit ; and now that he has acknowledged his error in supposing me capable of such ingratitude , I heartily forgive him ; but I can not , and will not , receive any more favours from him .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 17]: I can not put myself in a situation to be again mortified as I have been .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 36]: I feel I should no longer have the same pleasure in doing my duty as I once had , and I never could live under the same roof with those who at present serve him .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 42]: Tell him all this , and pray tell little Sarah how grateful I feel no her for all her kindness to me , and that I shall always think of her with regret , at being obliged to leave her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 18]: And at the remembrance of little Sarah I burst into tears , and sobbed on my pillow .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 27]: Captain Turnbull , whether he rightly estimated my character , or fell convinced that I had made up my mind , did not renew the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 19]: `` Well , Jacob , '' replied he , `` we 'll not talk of that any more .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 11]: I 'll give your messages just in your own words .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 15]: Now , take your draught , and try to get a little sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 32]: I complied with this request , and nothing but weakness now remaining , I rapidly regained my strength , and with my strength , my feelings of resentment increased in proportion .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 44]: Nothing but the very weak state that I was in when Captain Turnbull spoke to me would have softened me down to give the kind message that I did ; but my vindictive mind was subdued by disease , and better feelings predominated .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 38]: The only effect this had was to increase my animosity against the other parties who were the cause of my ill-treatment , and I vowed that they , at least , should one day repent their conduct .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 9]: The Dominie called upon me the following Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 12]: I was dressed and looking through the window when he arrived .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 54]: The frost was now intense , and the river was covered with large masses of ice , and my greatest pleasure was to watch them as they floated down with the tide ; `` Thou hast had a second narrow escape , my Jacob , '' said he , after some preliminary observations .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 29]: `` Once again did death -LRB- _ pallida mors _ -RRB- hover over thy couch ; but thou hast arisen , and thy fair fame is again established .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 21]: When wilt thou be able to visit Mr Drummond , and be able to thank him for his kindness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 21]: `` Never , sir , '' replied I ; `` I will never again enter Mr Drummond 's house . ''
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 10]: `` Nay , Jacob , this savoureth of enmity .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 15]: Are not we all likely to be deceived -- all likely to do wrong ?
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 17]: Did not I , even I , in thy presence , backslide into intemperance and folly ?
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 46]: Did not I disgrace myself before my pupil -- and shalt thou , in thy tender years , harbour ill-will against one who had cherished thee when thou wert destitute , and who was deceived with regard to thee by the base and evil-speaking ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 28]: `` I am obliged to Mr Drummond for all his kindness , sir , '' replied I ; `` but I never wish to enter his house .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 17]: I was turned out of it , and never will again go into it . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 3]: _ Eheu !
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 22]: Jacobe _ , thou art in error ; it is our duty to forgive as we hope to be forgiven . ''
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 29]: `` I do forgive , sir , if that is what is requested : but I can not , and will not , accept of further favours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 10]: The Dominie urged in vain , and left me .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 12]: Mr Tomkins also came , and argued the point without success .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 4]: I was resolved .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 24]: I was determined to be independent ; and I looked to the river as my father , mother , home , and everything .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 16]: As soon as my health was reinstated , Captain Turnbull one day came to me .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 43]: `` Jacob , '' said he , `` the lighter has returned : and I wish to know if you intend to go on board again , and afterwards go into the vessel into which Mr Drummond proposes to send you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 26]: `` I will go into no vessel through Mr Drummond 's means or interest , '' replied I. `` What will you do then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 3]: replied he .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 41]: `` I can always enter on board a man-of-war , '' replied I , `` if the worst comes to the worst ; but if I can serve out my apprenticeship on the river , I should prefer it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 36]: `` I rather expected this answer , Jacob , from what you have said to me already ; and I have been trying if I can not help you to something which may suit you .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 10]: You do n't mind being obliged to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 18]: `` O , no ; but promise you will never doubt me -- never accuse me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 11]: My voice faltered , and I could say no more .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 49]: `` No , my lad , that I will not ; I know you , as I think , pretty well ; and the heart that feels a false accusation as yours does is sure to guard against committing what you are so angry at being accused of .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 8]: Now , Jacob , listen to me .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 19]: You know old deaf Stapleton , whose wherry we have so often pulled up and down the river ?
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 17]: I have spoken to him to take you as his help , and he has consented .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 6]: Will you like to go ?
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 17]: He has served his time , and has a right to take a ` prentice . ''
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 24]: `` Yes , '' replied I , `` with pleasure ; and with more pleasure , from expecting to see you often . ''
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 18]: `` O , I promise you all my custom , Jacob , '' replied he , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 15]: `` We 'll often turn old Stapleton out , and have a row together .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 5]: Is it agreed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 16]: `` It is , '' replied I ; `` and many thanks to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 9]: `` Well , then , consider it settled .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 18]: Stapleton has a very good room , and all that 's requisite on shore , at Fulham .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 15]: I have seen his place , and I think you will be comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 57]: I did not know at the time how much Captain Turnbull had been my friend -- that he had made Stapleton take better lodgings , and had made up the difference to him , besides allowing him a trifle per week , and promising him a gratuity occasionally , if I were content with my situation .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 35]: In a few days I had removed all my clothes to Stapleton 's , had taken my leave of Mr Turnbull , and was established as an apprentice to a waterman on the Thames .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 29]: The lighter was still at the wharf when I left , and my parting with old Tom and his son was equally and sincerely felt on both sides .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 48]: `` Jacob , '' said old Tom , `` I likes your pride after all , 'cause why , I think you have some right to be proud ; and the man who only asks fair play , and no favour always will rise in this world .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 82]: But look you , Jacob , there 's sometimes a current ` gainst a man that no one can make head against ; and if so be that should be your case for a time , recollect the old house , the old woman , and old Tom , and there you 'll always find a hearty welcome , and a hearty old couple who 'll share with you what they have , be it good , bad , or indifferent .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 45]: Here 's luck to you , my boy ; and recollect , I means to go to the expense of painting the sides of my craft blue , and then you 'll always know her as she creeps up and down the river . ''
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 81]: `` And Jacob , '' said young Tom ; -- `` I may be a wild one , but I 'm a true one ; if ever you want me in fair weather and in foul -- good or bad -- for fun or for mischief -- for a help , or for a friend in need , through thick or thin , I 'm yours , even to the gallows ; and here 's my hand upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 26]: `` Just like you , Tom , '' observed his father ; `` but I know what you mean , and all 's right . ''
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 11]: I shook hands with them both , and we parted .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 49]: Thus did I remove from the lighter , and at once take up the profession of a waterman ; I walked down to the Fulham side , where I found Stapleton at the door of the public-house , standing with two or three others , smoking his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 34]: `` Well , lad , so you 're chained to my wherry for two or three years ; and I 'm to initiate you into all the rules and regulations of the company .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 53]: Now , I 'll tell you one thing , which is , d'ye see , when the river 's covered with ice , as it is just now , haul your wherry up high and dry , and smoke your pipe till the river is clear , as I do now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 23]: `` I might have guessed that , '' replied I , bawling in his ear , `` without you telling me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 33]: `` Very true ; but do n't bawl in my ear quite so loud , I hears none the better for it ; my ears require coaxing , that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 14]: `` Why , I thought you were as deaf as a post . ''
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 38]: `` Yes , so I be with strangers , 'cause I do n't know the pitch of their voice ; but with those about me I hear better when they speak quietly -- that 's human nature .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 35]: Come , let 's go home , my pipe is finished , and as there 's nothing to be done on the river , we may just as well make all tidy there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 33]: Stapleton had lost his wife ; but he had a daughter , fifteen years old , who kept his lodgings , and _ did for him _ , as he termed it .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 44]: He lived in part of some buildings leased by a boat-builder ; his windows looked out on the river ; and , on the first floor , a bay-window was thrown out , so that at high water the river ran under it .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 31]: As for the rooms , consisting of five , I can only say that they could not be spoken of as large and small , but as small and smaller .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 77]: The sitting-room was eight feet square , the two bed-rooms at the back , for himself and his daughter , just held a small bed each , and the kitchen and my room below were to match ; neither were the tenements in the very best repair , the parlour especially , hanging over the river , being lop-sided , and giving you the uncomfortable idea that it would every minute fall into the stream below .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 20]: Still , the builder declared that it would last many years without sinking further , and that was sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 23]: At all events , they were very respectable accommodations for a waterman , and Stapleton paid for them 10 pounds per annum .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 10]: Stapleton 's daughter was certainly a very well-favoured girl .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 18]: She had rather a large mouth ; but her teeth were very fine , and beautifully white .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 54]: Her hair was auburn -- her complexion very fair , her eyes were large , and of a deep blue , and from her figure , which was very good , I should have supposed her to have been eighteen , although she was not past fifteen , as I found out afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 21]: There was a frankness and honesty of countenance about her , and an intellectual smile , which was very agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 12]: `` Well , Mary , how do you get on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 10]: said Stapleton , as we ascended to the sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 13]: `` Here 's young Faithful come to take up with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 34]: `` Well , father , his bed 's all ready ; and I have taken so much dirt from the room that I expect we shall be indicted for filling up the river .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 13]: I wonder what nasty people lived in this house before us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 14]: `` Very nice rooms , nevertheless ; ai n't they , boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 43]: `` O yes , very nice for idle people ; you may amuse yourself looking out on the river , or watching what floats past , or fishing with a pin at high water , '' replied Mary , looking at me .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 29]: `` I like the river , '' replied I , gravely ; `` I was born on it , and hope to get my bread on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 39]: `` And I like this sitting-room , '' rejoined Stapleton ; `` how mighty comfortable it will be to sit at the open window , and smoke in the summer time , with one 's jacket off ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 33]: `` At all events you 'll have no excuse for dirtying the room , father ; and as for the lad , I suppose his smoking days have not come yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 22]: `` No , '' replied I ; `` but my days for taking off my jacket are , I suspect . ''
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 35]: `` O yes , '' replied she , `` never fear that ; father will let you do all the work you please , and look on -- wo n't you , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 23]: `` Do n't let your tongue run quite so fast , Mary ; you 're not over fond of work yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 25]: `` No ; there 's only one thing I dislike more , '' replied she , `` and that 's holding my tongue . ''
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 24]: `` Well , I shall leave you and Jacob to make it out together ; I am going back to the Feathers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 30]: And old Stapleton walked down stairs , and went back to the inn , saying , as he went out , that he should be back to his dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 34]: Mary continued her employment of wiping the furniture of the room with a duster for some minutes , during which I did not speak , but watched the floating ice on the river .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 17]: `` Well , '' said Mary , `` do you always talk as you do now ?
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 11]: if so , you 'll be a very nice companion .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 56]: Mr Turnbull who came to my father , told me that you was a sharp fellow , could read , write , and do everything , and that I should like you very much ; but if you mean to keep it all to yourself , you might as well not have had it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 23]: `` I am ready to talk when I have anything to talk about , '' replied I. `` That 's not enough .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 16]: I 'm ready to talk about nothing , and you must do the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 14]: `` Very well , '' replied I. `` How old are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 6]: `` How old am I !
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 8]: O , then you consider me nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 15]: I 'll try hard but you shall alter your opinion , my fine fellow .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 15]: However , to answer your question , I believe I 'm about fifteen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 4]: `` Not more ?
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 15]: well , there 's an old proverb , which I will not repeat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 25]: `` I know it , so you may save yourself the trouble , you saucy boy ; but now , for your age ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 3]: `` Mine !
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 15]: let me see ; well , I believe that I am nearly seventeen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 7]: `` Are you really so old ?
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 15]: well , now , I should have thought you no more than fourteen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 33]: This answer at first surprised me , as I was very stout and tall for my age ; but a moment 's reflection told me that it was given to annoy me .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 31]: A lad is as much vexed at being supposed younger than he really is as a man of a certain age is annoyed at being taken for so much older .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 4]: `` Pooh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 14]: replied I ; `` that shows how little you know about men . ''
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 23]: `` I was n't talking about men , that I know of ; but still , I do know something about them .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 8]: I 've had two sweethearts already . ''
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 9]: and what have you done with them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 5]: `` Done with them !
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 52]: I jilted the first for the second , because the second was better looking ; and when Mr Turnbull told me so much about you , I jilted the second to make room for you : but now I mean to try if I ca n't get him back again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 11]: `` With all my heart , '' replied I laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 20]: `` I shall prove but a sorry sweetheart , for I have never made love in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 12]: `` Have you ever had anybody to make love to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 13]: `` That 's the reason , Mr Jacob , depend upon it .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 69]: All you have to do is to swear that I 'm the prettiest girl in the world , that you like me better than anybody else in the world ; do anything in the world that I wish you to do -- spend all the money you have in the world in buying me ribbons and fairings , and then -- '' `` And then , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 30]: `` Why , then , I shall hear all you have to say , take all you have to give , and laugh at you in the bargain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 10]: `` But I should n't stand that long . ''
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 8]: `` O , yes , you would .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 61]: I 'd put you out of humour , and coax you in again ; the fact is , Jacob Faithful , I made my mind up , before I saw you , that you should be my sweetheart , and when I will have a thing , I will , so you may as well submit to it at once .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 32]: If you do n't , as I keep the key of the cupboard , I 'll half starve you ; that 's the way to tame any brute , they say .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 39]: And I tell you why , Jacob , I mean that you shall be my sweetheart ; it 's because Mr Turnbull told me that you knew Latin ; now , tell me , what is Latin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 19]: `` Latin is a language which people spoke in former times , but now they do not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 19]: `` Well , then , you shall make love to me in Latin , that 's agreed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 11]: `` And how do you mean to answer me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 12]: `` O , in plain English , to be sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 10]: `` But how are you to understand me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 9]: replied I , much amused with the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 27]: `` O , if you make love properly , I shall soon understand you ; I shall read the English of it in your eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 16]: `` Very well , I have no objection ; when am I to begin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 13]: `` Why , directly , you stupid fellow , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 5]: What a question ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 15]: I went close up to Mary , and repeated a few words of Latin .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 22]: `` Now , '' says I , `` look into my eyes , and see if you can translate them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 19]: `` Something impudent , I 'm sure , '' replied she , fixing her blue eyes on mine .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 43]: `` Not at all , '' replied I , `` I only asked for this , '' and I snatched a kiss , in return for which I received a box on the ear , which made it tingle for five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 26]: `` Nay , '' replied I , `` that 's not fair ; I did as you desired -- I made love in Latin . ''
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 36]: `` And I answered you , as I said I would , in plain English , '' replied Mary , reddening up to the forehead , but directly after bursting out into a loud laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 17]: `` Now , Mr Jacob , I plainly see that you know nothing about making love .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 31]: Bless me , a year 's dangling , and a year 's pocket-money should not have given you what you have had the impudence to take in so many minutes .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 21]: But it was my own fault , that 's certain , and I have no one to thank but myself .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 24]: I hope I did n't hurt you -- I 'm very sorry if I did ; but no more making love in Latin .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 9]: I 've had quite enough of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 19]: `` Well , then , suppose we make friends , '' replied I , holding out my hand .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 23]: `` That 's what I really wished to do , although I 've been talking so much nonsense , '' replied Mary .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 15]: `` I know we shall like one another , and be very good friends .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 45]: You ca n't help feeling kind towards a girl you 've kissed ; and I shall try by kindness to make up to you for the box on the ear ; so now , sit down , and let 's have a long talk .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 35]: Mr Turnbull told us that he wished you to serve out your apprenticeship on the river with my father , so that , if you agree , we shall be a long while together .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 91]: I take Mr Turnbull 's word , not that I can find it out yet , that you are a very good-tempered , good-looking , clever , modest lad ; and as an apprentice who remains with my father must live with us , of course I had rather it should be one of that sort than some ugly , awkward brute who -- '' `` Is not fit to make love to you , '' replied I. `` Who is not fit company for me , '' replied Mary .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 11]: `` I want no more love from you at present .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 59]: The fact is that father spends all the time he can spare from the wherry at the ale-house , smoking ; and it 's very dull for me , and having nothing to do , I look out of the window , and make faces at the young men as they pass by , just to amuse myself .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 32]: Now , there was no great harm in that a year or two ago ; but now , you know , Jacob -- '' `` Well now , what then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 11]: `` O , I 'm bigger , that 's all ?
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 20]: and what might be called sauciness in a girl may be thought something more of in a young woman .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 49]: So I 've been obliged to leave it off ; but being obliged to remain home , with nobody to talk to , I never was so glad as when I heard that you were to come ; so you see , Jacob , we must be friends .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 28]: I dare n't quarrel with you long , although I shall sometimes , just for variety , and to have the pleasure of making it up again .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 13]: Do you hear me -- or what are you thinking of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 13]: `` I 'm thinking that you 're a very odd girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 15]: `` I dare say that I am , but how can I help that ?
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 59]: Mother died when I was five years old , and father could n't afford to put me out , so he used to lock me in all day till he came home from the river ; and it was not till I was seven years old , and of some use , that the door was left open .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 24]: I never shall forget the day when he told me that in future he should trust me , and leave the door open .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 15]: I thought I was quite a woman , and have thought so ever since .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 42]: I recollect that I often peeped out , and longed to run about the world ; but I went two or three yards from the door , and felt so frightened , that I ran back as fast as I could .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 21]: Since that I have seldom quitted the house for an hour , and never have been out of Fulham . ''
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 10]: `` Then you have never been at school ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 7]: `` O , no -- never .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 7]: I often wish that I had .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 64]: I used to see the little girls coming home , as they passed our door , so merrily , with their bags from the school-house ; and I 'm sure , if it were only to have the pleasure of going there and back again for the sake of the run , I 'd have worked hard , if for nothing else . ''
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 12]: `` Would you like to learn to read and write ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 7]: `` Will you teach me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 17]: replied Mary , taking me by the arm , and looking me earnestly in the face .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 15]: `` Yes , I will , with pleasure , '' replied I , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 21]: `` We will pass the evening better than making love , after all , especially if you hit so hard .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 10]: How came you so knowing in those matters ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 42]: `` I do n't know , '' replied Mary , smiling ; `` I suppose , as father says , it 's human nature , for I never learnt anything ; but you will teach me to read and write ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 18]: `` I will teach you all I know myself , Mary , if you wish to learn .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 12]: Everything but Latin -- we 've had enough of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 9]: I shall be so much obliged to you .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 7]: I shall love you so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 7]: `` There you are again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 17]: `` No , no , I did n't mean that , '' replied Mary , earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 17]: `` I meant that -- after all , I do n't know what else to say .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 22]: I mean that I shall love you for your kindness , without your loving me again , that 's it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 64]: `` I understand you ; but now , Mary , as we are to be such good friends , it is necessary that your father and I should be good friends ; so I must ask you what sort of a person he is , for I know but little of him , and , of course , wish to oblige him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 36]: `` Well then , to prove to you that I 'm sincere , I will tell you something ; My father , in the first place , is a very good tempered sort of man .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 19]: He works pretty well , but might gain more , but he likes to smoke at the public-house .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 19]: All he requires of me is his dinner ready , his linen clean , and the house tidy .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 33]: He never drinks too much , and is always civil spoken ; but he leaves me too much alone , and talks too much about human nature , that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 15]: `` But he 's so deaf -- he ca n't talk to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 36]: `` Give me your hand -- now promise -- for I 'm going to do a very foolish thing , which is to trust a man -- promise you 'll never tell it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 17]: `` Well , I promise , '' replied I , supposing her secret of no consequence .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 11]: `` Well , then -- mind -- you 've promised .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 14]: Father is no more deaf than you or I. '' `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 16]: replied I ; `` why , he goes by the name of Deaf Stapleton ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 23]: `` I know he does , and makes everybody believe that he is so ; but it is to make money . ''
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 10]: `` How can he make money by that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 29]: `` There 's many people in business who go down the river , and they wish to talk of their affairs without being overheard as they go down .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 36]: They always call for Deaf Stapleton : and there 's many a gentleman and lady , who have much to say to each other , without wishing people to listen -- you understand me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 10]: `` O yes , I understand -- Latin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 30]: `` Exactly -- and they call for Deaf Stapleton ; and by this means he gets more good fares than any other waterman , and does less work . ''
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 14]: `` But how will he manage now that I am with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 67]: `` O , I suppose it will depend upon his customers ; if a single person wants to go down , you will take the sculls ; if they call for oars , you will both go ; if he considers Deaf Stapleton only is wanted , you will remain on shore ; or , perhaps , he will insist upon your being deaf too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 9]: `` But I do not like deceit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 22]: `` No , it 's not right ; although it appears to me that there is a great deal of it .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 18]: Still I should like you to sham deaf , and then tell me all that people say .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 6]: It would be so funny .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 8]: Father never will tell a word . ''
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 16]: `` So far , your father , to a certain degree , excuses himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 52]: `` Well , I think he will soon tell you what I have now told you , but till then you must keep your promise ; and now you must do as you please , as I must go down in the kitchen , and get dinner on the fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 18]: `` I have nothing to do , '' replied I ; `` can I help you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 17]: `` To be sure you can , and talk to me , which is better still .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 19]: Come down and wash the potatoes for me , and then I 'll find you some more work .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 12]: Well , I do think we shall be very happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 33]: I followed Mary Stapleton down into the kitchen , and we were soon very busy , and very noisy , laughing , talking , blowing the fire , and preparing the dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 13]: By the time that her father came home we were sworn friends .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 55]: IS VERY DIDACTIC , AND TREATS LEARNEDLY ON THE VARIOUS SENSES , AND `` HUMAN NATURE ; '' IS ALSO DIFFUSE ON THE BEST TRAINING TO PRODUCE A MORAL PHILOSOPHER -- INDEED , IT CONTAINS MATERIALS WITH WHICH TO BUILD UP ONE SYSTEM , AND HALF-A-DOZEN THEORIES , AS THESE THINGS ARE NOW MADE .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 69]: I was rather curious , after the secret confided to me by Mary Stapleton , to see how her father would behave ; but when we had sat and talked some time , as he appeared to have no difficulty in answering to any observation in a common pitch of the voice , I observed to him that he was not so deaf as I thought he was .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 40]: `` No , no , '' replied he ; `` in the house I hear very well , but in the open air I ca n't hear at all , if a person speaks to me two yards off .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 27]: Always speak to me close to my ear in the open air , but not loud , and then I shall hear you very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 16]: I caught a bright glance from Mary 's blue eye , and made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 48]: `` This frost will hold , I 'm afraid , '' continued Stapleton , `` and we shall have nothing to do for some days but to blow our fingers and spend our earnings ; but there 's never much doing at this time of the year .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 8]: The winter cuts us watermen up terribly .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 29]: As for me , I smokes my pipe and thinks on human natur ' ; but what you are to do Jacob , I ca n't tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 16]: `` Oh , he will teach me to read and write , '' replied Mary .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 13]: `` I do n't know that he shall , '' replied Stapleton .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 12]: `` What 's the use of reading and writing to you ?
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 30]: We 've too many senses already , in my opinion , and if so be we have learning to boot , why then all the worse for us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 10]: `` How many senses are there , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 4]: `` How many !
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 17]: I 'm sure I ca n't tell , but more than enough to puzzle us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 23]: `` There are only five , I believe , '' said I ; `` first , there 's _ hearing _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 24]: `` Well , '' replied Stapleton `` hearing may be useful at times ; but not hearing at times is much more convenient .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 17]: I make twice as much money since I lost the better part of my hearing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 61]: `` Well , then , there 's seeing , '' continued I. `` Seeing is useful at times , I acknowledge ; but I knows this , that if a man could pull a young couple about the river , and not be able to see now and then , it would be many a half-crown in his pocket . ''
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 14]: `` Well , then , now we come to _ tasting _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 10]: `` No use at all -- only a vexation .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 37]: If there was no tasting we should not care whether we ate brown bread or roast beef , drank water or XX ale ; and in these hard times that would be no small saving . ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 16]: `` Well , then , let me see , there 's _ smelling _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 7]: `` Smelling 's no use whatever .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 25]: For one good smell by the river 's side there be ten nasty ones ; and there is everywhere , to my conviction . ''
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 9]: `` Which is the next , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 7]: said Mary , smiling archly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 5]: _ Feeling _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 3]: `` Feeling !
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 8]: that 's the worst of the whole .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 30]: Always feel too cold in winter , too hot in summer -- feel a blow too ; feeling only gives pain ; that 's a very bad sense . ''
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 19]: `` Well , then , I suppose you think we should get on better without our senses . ''
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 9]: `` No , not without all of them .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 24]: A little hearing and a little seeing be all very well ; but there are other senses which you have forgot , Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 19]: Now , one I takes to be the very best of the bunch is _ smoking _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 15]: `` I never heard that was a sense , '' replied I , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 13]: `` Then you have n't half finished your education , Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 12]: `` Are reading and writing _ senses _ , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 3]: inquired Mary .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 57]: `` To be sure they be , girl ; for without sense you ca n't read and write ; and _ rowing _ be a sense just as well ; and there be many other senses ; but , in my opinion , most of the senses be nonsense , and only lead to mischief . ''
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 22]: `` Jacob , '' said Mary , whispering to my ear , `` is n't _ loving _ a sense ? ''

Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 19]: -LSB- Here old Stapleton paused for half a minute , and passed his hand across his eyes . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 56]: `` I was tried for manslaughter ; but it being proved that he came up and struck me first , I was acquitted , after lying two months in gaol , for I could n't get no bail ; but it was because I had been two months in gaol that I was let off .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 42]: At first , when I came out , I determined never to see your mother again ; but she came to me , and wound round me , and I loved her so much that I could n't shake her off .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 79]: As soon as she found that I was fairly hooked , she began to play with others ; but I would n't stand that , and every fellow that came near her was certain to have a turn out with me , and so I became a great fighter ; and she , seeing that I was the best man , and that no one else would come to her , one fine morning agreed to marry me .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 55]: Well , we were spliced , and the very first night I thought I saw poor Ben Jones standing by my bedside , and , for a week or so , I was not comfortable ; but , howsomever , it wore off , I plied at the stairs , and gained my money .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 13]: But my pipe 's out , and I 'm dry with talking .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 11]: Suppose I take a spell for a few minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 13]: Stapleton relighted his pipe , and for nearly half-an-hour smoked in silence .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 31]: What Mary 's thoughts were I can not positively assert ; but I imagined that , like myself , she was thinking about her mother 's conduct and her own .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 16]: I certainly was making the comparison , and we neither of us spoke a word .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 46]: `` Well , '' continued Stapleton , at last , `` I married your mother , Mary , and I only hope that any man who may take a fancy to you , will not have so much trouble with his wife as I had .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 37]: I thought that a ` ter she were settled she would give up all her nonsense , and behave herself -- but I suppose it was in her natur ' and she could n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 38]: She made eyes and gave encouragement to the men , until they became saucy and I became jealous , and I had to fight one , and then the other , until I became a noted pugilist .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 43]: I will say that your mother seemed always very happy when I beat my man , which latterly I always did ; but still she liked to be _ fit _ for , and I had hardly time to earn my bread .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 28]: At last , some one backed me against another man in the ring for fifty pound aside , and I was to have half if I won .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 85]: I was very short of blunt at the time , and I agreed ; so , a ` ter a little training the battle was fought , and I won easy : and the knowing ones liked my way of hitting so much that they made up another match with a better man , for two hundred pounds ; and a lord and other great people came to me , and I was introduced to them at the public-house , and all was settled .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 14]: So I became a regular prize-fighter , all through your mother , Mary .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 46]: Nay , do n't cry , child , I do n't mean to say that your mother , with all her love of being stared at and talked to , would have gone wrong ; but still it was almost as bad in my opinion .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 51]: Well , I was put into training , and after five weeks we met at Mousley Hurst , and a hard fight it was -- but I 've got the whole of it somewhere , Mary ; look in the drawer there , and you 'll see a newspaper . ''
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 33]: Mary brought out the newspaper , which was rolled up and tied with a bit of string , and Stapleton handed it over to me , telling me to read it aloud .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 13]: I did so , but I shall not enter into the details .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 62]: `` Yes , that 's all right enough , '' said Stapleton , who had taken advantage of my reading to smoke furiously , to make up for lost time ; `` but no good came of it , for one of the gemmen took a fancy to your mother , Mary , and tried to win her away from me .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 60]: I found him attempting to kiss her , and she refusing him -- but laughing , and , as I thought , more than half-willing ; so I floored him , and put him out of the house , and after that I never would have anything more to say with lords and gemmen , nor with fighting either .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 33]: I built a new wherry , and stuck to the river , and I shifted my lodgings that I might n't mix any more with those who knew me as a boxer .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 51]: Your mother was then brought to bed with you , and I hoped for a good deal of happiness , as I thought she would only think of her husband and child ; and so she did until you were weaned , and then she went on just as afore .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 77]: There was a captain of a vessel lying in the river , who used now and then to stop and talk with her ; but I thought little about that , seeing how every one talked with her and she with everybody ; and besides , she knew the captain 's wife , who was a very pretty woman , and used very often to ask Mary to go and see her , which I permitted .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 95]: But one morning , when I was going off to the boat -- for he had come down to me to take him to his vessel -- just as I was walking away with the sculls over my shoulder , I recollects my ` baccy box , which I had left , and I goes back and hears him say before I came into the door -- ` Recollect , I shall be here again by two o'clock , and then you promised to come on board my ship , and see -- . '
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 17]: I did n't hear the rest , but she laughed and said yes , she would .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 15]: I did n't show myself , but walked away and went to the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 30]: He followed me , and I rowed him up the river and took my fare -- and then I determined to watch them , for I felt mighty jealous .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 50]: So I lays off on my oars in the middle of the stream , and sure enough I see the captain and your mother get into a small skiff belonging to his ship , and pull away ; the captain had one oar and one of his men another .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 49]: I pulled a ` ter them as fast as I could , and at last they seed me ; and not wishing me to find her out , she begged them to pull away as fast as they could , for she knew how savage I would be .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 43]: Still I gained upon them , every now and then looking round and vowing vengeance in my heart , when all of a sudden I heard a scream , and perceived their boat to capsize , and all hands in the water .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 29]: They had not seen a warp of a vessel getting into the row , and had run over it , and , as it tautened , they capsized .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 35]: Your mother went down like a stone , Mary , and was not found for three days a ` terward ; and when I seed her sink I fell down in a fit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 18]: Here old Stapleton stopped , laid down his pipe , and rested his face in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 5]: Mary burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 95]: After a few minutes he resumed : `` When I came to , I found myself on board of the ship in the captain 's cabin , with the captain and his wife watching over me -- and then I came to understand that it was she who had sent for your mother , and that she was living on board , and that your mother had at first refused , because she knew that I did not like her to be on the river , but wishing to see a ship had consented .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 105]: So it was not so bad a ` ter all , only that a woman should n't act without her husband -- but you see , Mary , all this would not have happened if it had n't been that I overheard part of what was said ; and you might now have had a mother , and I a wife to comfort us , if it had not been for my unfortunate _ hearing _ -- so , as I said before , there 's more harm than good that comes from these senses -- at least so it has proved to me .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 77]: And now you have heard my story , and how your mother died , Mary ; so take care you do n't fall into the same fault , and be too fond of being looked at , which it does somehow or another appear to me you have a bit of a hankering a ` ter -- but like mother , like child , they say , and that 's _ human natur ' _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 14]: When Stapleton had concluded his narrative , he smoked his pipe in silence .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 26]: Mary sat at the table , with her hands pressed to her temples , apparently in deep thought ; and I felt anything but communicative .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 13]: In half-an-hour the pot of beer was finished , and Stapleton rose .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 19]: `` Come , Mary , do n't be thinking so much ; let 's all go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 11]: Show Jacob his room , and then come up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 34]: `` Jacob can find his own room , father , '' replied Mary , `` without my showing him ; he knows the kitchen , and there is but one other below . ''
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 28]: I took my candle , wished them good night , and went to my bed , which , although very homely , was at all events comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 53]: THE WARMTH OF MY GRATITUDE PROVED BY A VERY COLD TEST -- THE ROAD TO FORTUNE MAY SOMETIMES LEAD OVER A BRIDGE OF ICE -- MINE LAY UNDER IT -- AMOR VINCET EVERYTHING BUT MY OBSTINACY , WHICH YOUNG TOM AND THE OLD DOMINIE IN THE SEQUEL WILL PROVE TO THEIR COST .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 24]: For many days the frost continued , until at last the river was frozen over , and all communication by it was stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 31]: Stapleton 's money ran short , our fare became very indifferent , and Mary declared that we must all go begging with the market gardeners if it lasted much longer .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 36]: `` I must go and call upon Mr Turnbull , and ax him to help us , '' said Stapleton , one day , pulling his last shilling out and laying it on the table .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 21]: `` I 'm cleaned out ; but he 's a good gentleman , and will lend me a trifle . ''
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 18]: In the afternoon Stapleton returned , and I saw by his looks that he had been successful .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 28]: `` Jacob , '' said he , `` Mr Turnbull desires that you will breakfast with him to-morrow morning , as he wishes to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 18]: I set off accordingly at daylight the next morning , and was in good time for breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 22]: Mr Turnbull was as kind as ever , and began telling me long stories about the ice in the northern regions .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 31]: `` By-the-by , I hear there is an ox to be roasted whole , Jacob , a little above London Bridge ; suppose we go and see the fun . ''
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 29]: I consented , and we took the Brentford coach , and were put down at the corner of Queen Street , from thence we walked to the river .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 8]: The scene was very amusing and exciting .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 32]: Booths were erected on the ice , in every direction , with flags flying , people walking , and some skating , although the ice was too rough for that pastime .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 27]: The whole river was crowded with people , who now walked in security over where they , a month before , would have met with death .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 37]: Here and there smoke ascended from various fires , on which sausages and other eatables were cooking ; but the great attraction was the ox roasting whole , close to the centre pier of the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 33]: Although the ice appeared to have fallen at the spot where so many hundreds were assembled , yet as it was now four or five feet thick , there was no danger .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 49]: Here and there , indeed , were what were called rotten places , where the ice was not sound ; but these were intimated by placards , warning people not to approach too near ; and close to them were ropes and poles for succour , if required .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 26]: We amused ourselves for some time with the gaiety of the scene , for the sun shone out brightly , and the sky was clear .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 31]: The wind was fresh from the northward , and piercing cold in the shade , the thermometer being then , it was said , twenty-eight degrees below the freezing point .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 45]: We had been on the ice about three hours , amusing ourselves , when Mr Turnbull proposed our going home , and we walked up the river towards Blackfriars Bridge , where we proposed to land , and take the coach at Charing Cross .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 27]: `` I wonder how the tide is now , '' observed Mr Turnbull to me ; `` it would be rather puzzling to find out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 17]: `` Not if I can find a hole , '' replied I , looking for one .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 8]: `` Stop , here is one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 16]: I threw in a piece of ice , and found that it was strong ebb .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 41]: We continued our walk over the ice , which was now very rough , when Mr Turnbull 's hat fell off , and the wind catching it , it blew away , skimming across the ice at a rapid rate .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 26]: Mr Turnbull and I gave chase , but could scarcely keep up with it , and , at all events , could not overtake it .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 17]: Many people on the river laughed as we passed , and watched us in our chase .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 46]: Mr Turnbull was the foremost , and , heedless in the pursuit , did not observe a large surface of rotten ice before him ; neither did I , until all at once I heard it break and saw Mr Turnbull fall in and disappear .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 20]: Many people were close to us , and a rope was laid across the spot to designate the danger .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 22]: I did not hesitate -- I loved Mr Turnbull , and my love and my feelings of resentment were equally potent .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 39]: I seized the bight of the rope , twisted it round my arm , and plunged in after , recollecting it was ebb tide : fortunate for Mr Turnbull it was that he had accidentally put the question .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 39]: I sank under the ice , and pushed down the stream , and in a few seconds felt myself grappled by him I sought , and at almost the same time , the rope hauling in from above .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 39]: As soon as they found there was resistance , they knew that I , at least , was attached to it , and they hauled in quicker , not , however , until I had lost my recollection .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 39]: Still I clung to the rope with the force of a drowning man , and Mr Turnbull did the same to me , and we shortly made our appearance at the hole in which we had been plunged .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 30]: A ladder was thrown across , and two of the men of the Humane Society came to our assistance , pulled us out , and laid us upon it .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 16]: They then drew back and hauled us on the ladder to a more secure situation .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 33]: We were both still senseless ; but having been taken to a public-house on the river-side , were put to bed , and medical advice having been procured , were soon restored .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 23]: The next morning we were able to return in a chaise to Brentford , where our absence had created the greatest alarm .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 62]: Mr Turnbull spoke but little the whole time ; but he often pressed my hand , and when I requested him to drop me at Fulham , that I might let Stapleton and his daughter know that I was safe , he consented , saying , `` God bless you , my fine boy ; I will see you soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 27]: When I went up the stairs of Stapleton 's lodgings , I found Mary by herself ; she started up as soon as she saw me .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 9]: `` Where _ have _ you been ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 9]: said she , half crying , half smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 18]: `` Under the ice , '' I replied , `` and only thawed again this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 9]: `` Are you in earnest , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 38]: said she ; `` now do n't plague and frighten me , I 've been too frightened already ; I never slept a wink last night ; '' I then told her the circumstances which had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 12]: `` I was sure something had happened , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 14]: `` I told my father so , but he would n't believe it .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 51]: You promised to be at home to give me my lesson , and I know you never break your word ; but my father smoked away , and said , that when boys are amused , they forget their promises , and that it was nothing but human natur ' .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 30]: Oh , Jacob , I 'm so glad you 're back again , and after what has happened , I do n't mind your kissing me for once . ''
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 13]: And Mary held her face towards me , and returned my kiss .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 35]: `` There , that must last you a long while , recollect , '' said she , laughing ; `` you must not think of another until you 're under the ice again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 16]: `` Then I trust it will be the last , '' replied I , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 28]: `` You are not in love with me , Jacob , that 's clear , or you would not have made that answer , '' replied Mary .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 27]: I had seen a great deal of Mary , and though she certainly was a great flirt , yet she had many excellent and amiable qualities .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 118]: For the first week after her father had given us the history of his life , his remarks upon her mother appeared to have made a decided impression upon her , and her conduct was much more staid and demure ; but as the remembrance wore off , so did her conduct become coquettish and flirting as before ; still , it was impossible not to be fond of her , and even with all her caprice there was such a fund of real good feeling and amiableness , which , when called forth , was certain to appear , that I often thought how dangerous and captivating a girl she would be when she grew up .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 23]: I had again produced the books , which I had thrown aside with disgust , to teach her to read and write .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 39]: Her improvement was rapid , and would have been still more so if she had not been just as busy in trying to make me fond of her as she was in surmounting the difficulties of her lessons .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 56]: But she was very young ; and although , as her father declared , it was her _ natur ' _ to run after the men , there was every reason to hope that a year or two would render her less volatile , and add to those sterling good qualities which she really possessed .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 57]: In heart and feeling she was a modest girl , although the buoyancy of her spirits often carried her beyond the bounds prescribed by decorum , and often called forth a blush upon her own animated countenance , when her good sense , or the remarks of others , reminded her of her having committed herself .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 32]: It was impossible to know Mary and not like her , although , at a casual meeting , a rigid person might go away with an impression by no means favourable .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 31]: As for myself , I must say , that the more I was in her company the more I was attached to her , and the more I respected her .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 8]: Old Stapleton came home in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 21]: He had , as usual , been smoking , and thinking of human natur ' , at the Feathers public-house .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 49]: I told him what had happened , and upon the strength of it he sent for an extra pot of beer for Mary and me , which he insisted upon our drinking between us -- a greater proof of good-will on his part could not have been given .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 62]: Although Captain Turnbull appeared to have recovered from the effects of the accident , yet it seemed that such was not the case , as the morning after his arrival he was taken ill with shivering and pains in his loins , which ended in ague and fever , and he did not quit his bed for three or four weeks .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 42]: I , on the contrary , felt no ill effects ; but the constitution of a youth is better able to meet such violent shocks than that of a man of sixty years old , already sapped by exposure and fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 41]: As the frost still continued , I complied with Captain Turnbull 's request to come up and stay with him , and for many days , until he was able to leave his bed , I was his constant nurse .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 63]: The general theme of his conversation was on my future prospects , and a wish that I would embark in some pursuit or profession more likely to raise me in the world ; but on this head I was positive , and also another point , which was , that I would in future put myself under an obligation to no one .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 22]: I could not erase from my memory the injuries I had received , and my vindictive spirit continually brooded over them .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 9]: I was resolved to be independent and free .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 93]: I felt that in the company I was in I was with my equals , or , if there were any superiority , it was on my part , arising from education , and I never would submit to be again in the society of those above me , in which I was admitted as a favour , and by the major part looked down upon , and at the same time liable , as I had once been , to be turned out with contumely on the first moment of caprice .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 10]: Still , I was very fond of Captain Turnbull .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 92]: He had always been kind to me , spoke to me on terms of equality , and had behaved with consistency , and my feelings towards him since the accident had consequently strengthened ; but we always feel an increased regard towards those to whom we have been of service , and my pride was softened by the reflection that , whatever might be Mr Turnbull 's good-will towards me , he never could , even if I would permit it , repay me for the life which I had preserved .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 57]: Towards him I felt unbounded regard ; towards those who had ill-treated me , unlimited hatred ; towards the world in general a mixture of feeling which I could hardly analyse ; and , as far as regarded myself , a love of liberty and independence , which nothing would ever have induced me to compromise .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 211]: As I did not wish to hurt Captain Turnbull 's feelings by a direct refusal to all his proffers of service , and remarks upon the advantages which might arise , I generally made an evasive answer ; but when , on the day proposed for my departure , he at once came to the point , offering me everything , and observing that he was childless , and , therefore , my acceptance of his offer would be injurious to nobody ; when he took me by the hand , and drawing me near to him , passed his arm round me , and spoke to me in the kind accents of a father , almost entreating me to consent -- the tears of gratitude coursed each other rapidly down my cheeks , but my resolution was no less firm -- although it was with a faltering , voice that I replied , `` You have been very kind to me , sir -- very kind -- and I shall never forget it ; and I hope I shall deserve it -- but -- Mr Drummond , and Mrs Drummond , and Sarah , were also kind to me -- very kind to me -- you know the rest .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 45]: I will remain as I am , if you please ; and if you wish to do me a kindness ; if you wish me to love you , as I really do , let me be as I am -- free and independent .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 33]: I beg it of you as the greatest favour that you can possibly confer on me -- the only favour which I can accept , or shall be truly thankful for . ''
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 10]: Captain Turnbull was some minutes before he could reply .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 59]: He then said -- `` I see it is useless , and I will not tease you any more ; but , Jacob , do not let the fire of injustice which you have received from your fellow-creatures prey so much upon your mind , or induce you to form the mistaken idea that the world is bad .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 39]: As you live on , you will find much good ; and recollect , that those who injured you , from the misrepresentation of others , have been willing , and have offered , to repair their fault .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 17]: They can do no more , and I wish you could get over this vindictive feeling .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 14]: Recollect , we must forgive , as we hope to be forgiven . ''
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 21]: `` I do sometimes , '' said I , `` for Sarah 's sake -- I ca n't always . ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 14]: `` But you ought to forgive , for other reasons , Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 17]: `` I know I ought -- but if I can not , I can not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 21]: `` Nay , my boy , I never heard you talk so -- I was going to say -- wickedly .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 11]: Do you not perceive that you are now in error ?
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 39]: You will not abandon a feeling which your own good sense and religion tell you to be wrong -- you cling to it -- and yet you will admit of no excuse for the errors of others . ''
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 27]: `` I feel what you say -- and the truth of it , sir , '' replied I `` but I can not combat the feeling .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 48]: I will , therefore , admit every excuse you please for the faults of others ; but at the same time , I am surely not to be blamed if I refuse to put myself in a situation where I am again liable to meet with mortification .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 30]: Surely I am not to be censured , if I prefer to work for my bread after my own fashion , and prefer the river to dry land ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 27]: `` No , that I acknowledge ; but what I dislike in the choice is , that it is dictated by feelings of resentment . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 23]: _ What 's done ca n't be helped _ , '' replied I , quickly , wishing to break off the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 27]: `` Very true , Jacob ; but I follow that up with another of your remarks , which is , ` Better luck next time . '
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 22]: God bless you , my boy ; take care of yourself , and do n't get under the ice again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 39]: `` For you I would to-morrow , '' replied I , taking the proffered hand : `` but if I could only see that Hodgson near a hole -- '' `` You 'd not push him in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 11]: `` Indeed I would , '' replied I , bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 32]: `` Jacob , you would not , I tell you -- you think so now , but if you saw him in distress you would assist him as you did me .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 14]: I know you , my boy , better than you know yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 15]: Whether Captain Turnbull or I were right remains to be proved in the sequel .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 23]: We then shook hands , and I hastened away to see Mary , whom I had often thought of during my absence .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 10]: `` Who do you think has been here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 8]: said Mary , after our first greeting .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 18]: `` I can not guess , '' replied I. `` Not old Tom and his son ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 28]: `` No ; I do n't think it was old Tom , but it was such an old quiz -- with such a nose -- O heavens !
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 15]: I thought I should have died with laughing as soon as he went downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 22]: Do you know , Jacob , that I made love to him , just to see how he 'd take it .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 8]: You know who it is now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 4]: `` O yes !
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 9]: you mean the Dominie , my schoolmaster . ''
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 77]: `` Yes , he told me so ; and I talked so much about you , and about your teaching me to read and write , and how fond I was of learning , and how I should like to be married to an elderly man who was a great scholar , who would teach me Latin and Greek , that the old gentleman became quite chatty , and sat for two hours talking to me .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 34]: He desired me to say that he should call here to-morrow afternoon , and I begged him to stay the evening , as you are to have two more of your friends here .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 10]: Now , who do you think are those ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 15]: `` I have no others , except old Tom Beazeley and his son . ''
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 53]: `` Well , it is your old Tom after all , and a nice old fellow he is , although I would not like him for a husband ; but as for his son -- he 's a lad after my own heart -- I 'm quite in love with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 30]: `` Your love will do you no harm , Mary ; but , recollect , what may be a joke to you may not be so to other people .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 33]: As for the Dominie meeting old Beazeley and his son , I do n't exactly know how that will suit , for I doubt if he will like to see them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 3]: inquired Mary .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 26]: Upon a promise never to hint at them , I briefly stated the circumstances attending the worthy man 's voyage on board of the lighter .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 34]: Mary paused , and then said , `` Jacob , did we not read the last time that the most dangerous rocks to men were _ wine _ and _ women _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 12]: `` Yes , we did , if I recollect right . ''
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 32]: `` Humph , '' said she ; `` the old gentleman has given plenty of lessons in his time , and it appears that he has received _ one _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 16]: `` We may do so to the last day of our existence , Mary . ''
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 34]: `` Well , he is a very clever , learned man , I 've no doubt , and looks down upon all of us -LRB- not you , Jacob -RRB- as silly people .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 15]: I 'll try if _ I _ ca n't give him a lesson . ''
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 12]: `` You , Mary , what can you teach him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 18]: `` Never mind , we shall see ; '' and Mary turned the discourse on her father .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 18]: `` You know , I suppose , that father is gone up to Mr Turnbull 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 8]: `` No , I did not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 22]: `` Yes , he has ; he was desired to go there this morning , and has n't been back since .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 23]: Jacob , I hope you wo n't be so foolish again , for I do n't want to lose my master . ''
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 23]: `` Oh , never fear ; I shall teach you all you want to know before I die , '' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 30]: `` Do n't be too sure of that , '' replied Mary ; `` how do you know how much I may wish to have of your company ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 21]: `` Well , if I walk off in a hurry , I 'll make you over to young Tom Beazeley .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 18]: You 're half in love with him already , you know , '' replied I , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 24]: `` Well , he is a nice fellow , '' replied she ; `` he laughs more than you do , Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 55]: `` He has suffered less , '' replied I , gloomily , calling to mind what had occurred ; `` but , Mary , he is a fine young man , and a good-hearted , clever fellow to boot ; and when you do know him , you will like him very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 45]: As I said this , I heard her father coming up stairs ; he came in high good-humour with his interview with Captain Turnbull , called for his pipe and pot , and was excessively fluent upon '' _ human natur ' _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 57]: `` THE FEAST OF REASON AND THE FLOW OF SOUL '' -- STAPLETON , ON HUMAN NATURE , PROVES THE FORMER ; THE DOMINIE , IN HIS MELTING MOOD , THE LATTER -- SALL 'S SHOE PARTICULARLY NOTED , AND THE TRUE `` READING MADE EASY '' OF A MIND AT EASE , BY OLD TOM .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 77]: The afternoon of the next day I heard a well-known voice , which carolled forth , as Mary huddled up her books , and put them out of the way ; for at that time I was , as usual , giving her a lesson : -- `` And many strange sights I 've seen , And long I 've been a rover , And everywhere I 've been , But now the wars are over .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 33]: I 've been across the line , Where the sun will burn your nose off ; And I 've been in northern climes , Where the frost would bite your toes off .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 15]: Fal de ral , fal de ral , fal de ral de liddy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 15]: `` Heave a-head , Tom , and let me stump up at my leisure .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 26]: It 's like warping ` gainst wind and tide with me -- and I gets up about as fast as lawyers go to heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 37]: I thought when Tom came up first that he had been at unusual trouble in setting off his person , and certainly a better-looking , frank , open , merry countenance was seldom to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 17]: In person he was about an inch taller than I , athletic , and well formed .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 48]: He made up to Mary , who , perceiving his impatience , and either to check him before me , or else from her usual feeling of coquetry , received him rather distantly , and went up to old Tom , with whom she shook hands warmly .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 3]: `` Whew !
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 9]: what 's in the wind now , Jacob ?
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 19]: Why , we parted the best friends in the world , '' said Tom , looking at Mary .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 26]: `` Sheer off yourself , Tom , '' replied I , laughing ; `` and you 'll see that she 'll come to again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 5]: `` Oh , oh !
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 12]: so the wind 's in that quarter , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 3]: replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 17]: `` With all my heart -- I can show false colours as well as she can .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 33]: But I say , Jacob , before I begin my manoeuvres , tell me if you wish me to hoist the neutral flag -- for I wo n't interfere with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 53]: `` Here 's my hand upon it , Tom , that the coast is clear as far as I 'm concerned ; but take care -- she 's a clipper , and not unlikely to slip through your fingers , even when you have her under your lee , within hail . ''
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 11]: `` Let me alone , Jacob , for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 25]: `` And more , Tom , when you 're in possession of her , she will require a good man at the helm . ''
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 11]: `` Then she 's just the craft after my fancy .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 31]: I hate your steady , slow-sailing craft , that will steer themselves , almost ; give me one that requires to be managed by a man and a seaman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 48]: `` If well manned , she will do anything , depend upon it , Tom , for she 's as sound below as possible ; and although she is down to her bearings on the puff of the moment , yet she 'd not careen further . ''
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 37]: `` Well , then , Jacob , all 's right ; and now you 've told me what tack she 's on , see if I do n't shape a course to cut her off . ''
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 51]: `` Well , Jacob , my good boy , so you 've been under the water again ; I thought you had enough of it when Fleming gave you such a twist ; but , however , this time you went to sarve a friend , which was all right .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 18]: My sarvice to you Mr Stapleton , '' continued old Tom , as Stapleton made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 12]: `` I was talking to Jacob about his last dive . ''
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 11]: `` Nothing but human natur ' , '' replied Stapleton .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 35]: `` Well , now , '' replied old Tom , `` I consider that going plump into the river , when covered with ice , to be quite contrary to human natur ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 11]: `` But not to save a friend , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 32]: `` No -- because , that be Jacob 's nature ; so you see one nature conquered the other , and that 's the whole long and short of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 33]: `` Well , now , suppose we sit down and make ourselves comfortable , '' observed Stapleton ; `` but here be somebody else coming up -- who can it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 26]: `` I say , old codger , considering you be as deaf as a post , you hears pretty well , '' said old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 19]: `` Yes , I hear very well in the house , provided people do n't speak loud . ''
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 28]: `` Well , that 's a queer sort of deafness ; I think we are all troubled with the same complaint , '' cried Tom , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 11]: During this remark , the Dominie made his appearance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 21]: _ Salve Domine _ , '' said I upon his entering , taking my worthy pedagogue by the hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 11]: _ Et tu quoque , fili mi , Jacobe _ !
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 6]: But whom have we here ?
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 11]: the deaf man , the maiden , and -- ehu !
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 22]: -- the old man called old Tom , and likewise the young Tom ; '' and the Dominie looked very grave .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 48]: `` Nay , sir , '' said young Tom , going up to the Dominie ; `` I know you are angry with us , because we both drank too much when we were last in your company ; but we promise -- do n't we father ?
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 8]: -- not to do so again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 27]: This judicious reply of young Tom 's put the Dominie more at his ease ; what he most feared was raillery and exposure on their parts .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 28]: `` Very true , old gentleman ; Tom and I did bowse our jibs up a little too taut when we last met -- but what then ?
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 14]: -- there was the grog , and there was nothing to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 10]: `` All human natur ' , '' observed Stapleton .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 24]: `` Come , sir , you have not said one word to me , '' said Mary , going up to the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 27]: `` Now you must sit down by me , and take care of me , and see that they all behave themselves and keep sober . ''
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 26]: The Dominie cast a look at Mary , which was intended for her alone , but which was not unperceived by young Tom or me .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 33]: `` We shall have some fun , Jacob , '' said he , aside , as we all sat down to the table , which just admitted six , with close stowage .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 135]: The Dominie on one side of Mary , Tom on the other , Stapleton next to Tom , then I and old Tom , who closed in on the other side of the Dominie , putting one of his timber toes on the old gentleman 's corns , which induced him to lift up his leg in a hurry , and draw his chair still closer to Mary , to avoid a repetition of the accident ; while old Tom was axing pardon , and Stapleton demonstrating that , on the part of old Tom , not to _ feel _ with a wooden leg , and on the part of the Dominie , to _ feel _ with a bad corn , was all nothing but '' _ human natur ' _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 35]: At last we were all seated , and Mary , who had provided for the evening , produced two or three pots of beer , a bottle of spirits , pipes , and tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 22]: `` Liberty Hall -- I smokes , '' said Stapleton , lighting his pipe , and falling back on his chair .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 32]: `` I 'll put a bit of clay in my mouth too , '' followed up old Tom ; `` it makes one thirsty , and enjoy one 's liquor . ''
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 22]: `` Well , I malts , '' said Tom , reaching a pot of porter , and taking a long pull .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 9]: `` What do you do , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 10]: `` I shall wait a little , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 10]: `` And what do you do , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 6]: said Mary to the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 6]: The Dominie shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 17]: `` Nay but you must -- or I shall think you do not like my company .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 11]: Come , let me fill a pipe for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 23]: Mary filled a pipe , and handed it to the Dominie , who hesitated , looked at her , and was overcome .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 8]: He lighted it , and smoked furiously .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 41]: `` The ice is breaking up -- we shall have a change of weather -- the moon quarters to-morrow , '' observed old Tom , puffing between every observation ; `` and then honest men may earn their bread again .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 11]: Bad times for you , old codger , heh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 6]: continued he , addressing Stapleton .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 16]: Stapleton nodded an assent through the smoke , which was first perceived by old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 23]: `` Well , he ar ` nt deaf , a ` ter all ; I thought he was only shamming a bit .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 21]: I say , Jacob , this is the weather to blow your fingers , and make your eyes bright . ''
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 48]: `` Rather to blow a cloud and make your eyes water , '' replied Tom , taking up the pot : `` I 'm just as thirsty with swallowing smoke , as if I had a pipe myself -- at all events , I pipe my eye .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 35]: Jacob , '' continued Tom , to me apart , `` do look how the old gentleman is _ funking _ Mary , and casting sheeps ' eyes at her through the smoke . ''
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 38]: `` He appears as if he were inclined to board her in the smoke , '' replied I. `` Yes , and she to make no fight of it , but surrender immediately , '' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 53]: `` Do n't you believe it , Tom ; I know her better ; she wants to laugh at him -- nothing more ; she winked her eye at me just now , but I would not laugh , as I did not choose that the old gentleman should be trifled with .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 8]: I will tax her severely to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 88]: During all this time old Tom and Stapleton smoked in silence : the Dominie made use of his eyes in dumb parlance to Mary , who answered him with her own bright glances , and Tom and I began to find it rather dull ; when at last old Tom 's pipe was exhausted , and he laid it down ; `` There , I 'll smoke no more -- the worst of a pipe is that one ca n't smoke and talk at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 22]: Mary , my girl , take your eyes off the Dominie 's nose , and hand me that bottle of stuff .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 21]: What , glass to mix it in ; that 's more genteel than we are on board , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 23]: Tom filled a rummer of grog , took half off at a huge sip , and put it down on the table .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 11]: `` Will you do as we do , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 7]: said he , addressing the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 18]: `` Nay , friend Dux , nay -- pr ` ythee persuade me not -- avaunt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 22]: and the Dominie , with an appearance of horror , turned away from the bottle handed towards him by old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 6]: `` Not drink anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 39]: said Mary to the Dominie , looking at him with surprise , `` but indeed you must , or I shall think you despise us , and do not think us fit to be in your company . ''
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 9]: `` Nay , maiden , entreat me not .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 12]: Ask anything of me but this , '' replied the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 42]: `` Ask anything but this -- that 's just the way people have of refusing , '' replied Mary ; `` were I to ask anything else , it would be the same answer -- ` ask anything but this . '
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 17]: Now , if you will not drink to please me , I shall quarrel with you .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 15]: You shall drink a glass , and I 'll mix it for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 6]: The Dominie shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 15]: Mary made a glass of grog , and then put it to her lips .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 25]: `` Now , if you refuse to drink it , after I have tasted it , I 'll never speak to you again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 11]: So saying , she handed the glass to the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 19]: `` Verily , maiden , I must needs refuse , for I did make a mental vow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 6]: `` What vow was that ?
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 8]: was it sworn on the Bible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 17]: `` Nay , not on the sacred book , but in my thoughts most solemnly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 20]: I make those vows every day , and never keep one of them ; so that wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 11]: Now , observe , I give you one more chance .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 66]: I shall drink a little more , and if you do not immediately put your lips to the same part of the tumbler , I 'll never drink to you again ; '' Mary put the tumbler again to her lips , drank a little , with her eyes fixed upon the Dominie , who watched her with distended nostrils and muscular agitation of countenance .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 34]: With her sweetest smile , she handed him the tumbler ; the Dominie half held out his hand , withdrew it , put it down again , and by degrees took the tumbler .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 21]: Mary conquered , and I watched the malice of her look as the liquor trickled down the Dominie 's throat .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 6]: Tom and I exchanged glances .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 55]: The Dominie put down the tumbler , and then , looking round , like a guilty person , coloured up to the eyes ; but Mary , who perceived that her victory was but half achieved , put her hand upon his shoulder , and asked him to let her taste the grog again .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 17]: I also , to make him feel more at ease , helped myself to a glass .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 76]: Tom did the same , and old Tom with more regard to the feelings of the Dominie than in his own bluntness of character I would have given him credit for , said in a quiet tone , `` The old gentleman is afraid of grog , because he seed me take a drop too much , but that 's no reason why grog ar 'n' t a good thing , and wholesome in moderation .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 50]: A glass or two is very well , and better still when sweetened by the lips of a pretty girl ; and , even if the Dominie does not like it , he 's too much of a gentleman not to give up his dislikes to please a lady .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 23]: More 's the merit ; for , if he did like it , it would be no sacrifice , that 's sartain .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 11]: Do n't you think so , my old boozer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 11]: continued he , addressing Stapleton , who smoked in silence .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 23]: `` Human natur ' , '' replied Stapleton , taking the pipe out of his mouth , and spitting under the table .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 41]: `` Very true , master ; and so here 's to your health , Mr Dominie , and may you never want a pretty girl to talk to , or a glass of grog to drink her health with . ''
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 45]: `` Oh , but the Dominie do n't care about pretty girls , father , '' replied Tom ; `` he 's too learned and clever ; he thinks about nothing but the moon , and Latin and Greek , and all that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 12]: `` Who can say what 's under the skin , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 19]: There 's no knowing what is , and what is n't -- Sall 's shoe for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 17]: `` Never heard of Sall 's shoe , father ; that 's new to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 11]: `` Did n't I ever tell you that , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 22]: -- Well , then , you shall have it now -- that is , if all the company be agreeable . ''
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 15]: `` Oh , yes , '' cried Mary ; `` pray tell us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 11]: `` Would you like to hear it , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 30]: `` I never heard of Sall Sue in my life , and would fain hear her history , '' replied the Dominie ; `` proceed , friend Dux . ''
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 42]: `` Well , then , you must know when I was a-board of the Terp-sy-chore , there was a fore-topman , of the name of Bill Harness , a good sort of chap enough , but rather soft in the upper-works .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 46]: Now , we 'd been on the Jamaica station for some years , and had come home , and merry enough , and happy enough we were -LRB- those that were left of us -RRB- , and we were spending our money like the devil .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 120]: Bill Harness had a wife , who was very fond of he , and he was very fond of she , but she was a slatternly sort of a body , never tidy in her rigging , all adrift at all times , and what 's more , she never had a shoe up at heel , so she went by the name of Slatternly Sall , and the first lieutenant , who was a ` ticular sort of a chap , never liked to see her on deck , for you see she put her hair in paper on New Year 's day , and never changed it or took it out till the year came round again .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 25]: However , be it as it may be , she loved Bill , and Bill loved she , and they were very happy together .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 50]: A'ter all , it ai n't whether a woman 's tidy without that makes a man 's happiness ; it depends upon whether she be right within ; that is , if she be good-tempered , and obliging , and civil , and ` commodating , and so forth .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 46]: A'ter the first day or two , person 's nothing -- eyes get palled , like the cap-stern when the anchor 's up to the bows ; but what a man likes is , not to be disturbed by vagaries , or gusts of temper .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 39]: Well , Bill was happy -- but one day he was devilish unhappy , because Sall had lost one of her shoes , which was n't to be wondered at , considering as how she was always slipshod .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 10]: ` Who has seen my wife 's shoe ? '
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 3]: says he .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 37]: ` Hang your wife 's shoe , ' said one , ` it war n't worth casting an eye upon ; ' Still he cried out , ` Who has seen my wife 's shoe ? '
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 9]: ` I seed it , ' says another .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 4]: ` Where ? '
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 3]: says Bill .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 13]: ` I seed it down at heel , ' says the fellow .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 41]: But Bill still hallooed out about his wife 's shoe , which it appeared she had dropped off her foot as she was going up the forecastle ladder to take the air a bit , just as it was dark .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 32]: At last Bill made so much fuss about it that the ship 's company laughed , and all called out to each other , ` Who has seen Sall 's shoe ?
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 9]: -- Have you got Sall 's shoe ? '
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 19]: and they passed the word fore and aft the whole evening , till they went to their hammocks .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 35]: Notwithstanding , as Sall 's shoe was not forthcoming , the next morning Bill goes on the quarter-deck , and complains to the first lieutenant , as how he had lost Sall 's shoe .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 33]: ` Damn Sall 's shoe , ' said he , ` have n't I enough to look after without your wife 's confounded shoes , which ca n't be worth twopence ? '
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 65]: Well , Bill argues that his wife had only one shoe left , and that wo n't keep two feet dry , and begs the first lieutenant to order a search for it ; but the first lieutenant turns away , and tells him to go to the devil , and all the men grin at Bill 's making such a fuss about nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 49]: So Bill at last goes up to the first lieutenant , and whispers something , and the first lieutenant booms him off with his speaking trumpet , as if he were making too free , in whispering to his commanding officer , and then sends for the master-at-arms .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 50]: ` Collier , ' says he , ` this man has lost his wife 's shoe : let a search be made for it immediately -- take all the ship 's boys , and look everywhere for it ; if you find it bring it up to me . '
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 93]: So away goes the master-at-arms with his cane , and collects all the boys to look for Sall 's shoe -- and they go peeping about the maindeck , under the guns , and under the hen-coops , and in the sheep-pen , and everywhere ; now and then getting a smart slap with the cane behind , upon the taut part of their trowsers , to make them look sharp , until they all wished Sall 's shoe at Old Nick , and her too , and Bill in the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 73]: At last one of the boys picks it out of the manger , where it had lain all the night , poked up and down by the noses of the pigs , who did n't think it eatable , although it might have smelt human-like ; the fact was , it was the same boy who had picked up Sall 's shoe when she dropped it , and had shied it forward .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 29]: It sartainly did not seem to be worth all the trouble , but howsomever it was taken aft by the master-at-arms , and laid on the capstern head .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 88]: Then Bill steps out and takes the shoe before the first lieutenant , and cuts it open , and from between the lining pulls out four ten pound notes , which Sall had sewn up there by way of security ; and the first lieutenant tells Bill he was a great fool to trust his money in the shoe of a woman who always went slipshod , and tells him to go about his business , and stow his money away in a safer place next time .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 30]: A'ter , if any thing was better than it looked to be , the ship 's company used always to say it was like _ Sall 's shoe _ .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 7]: There you have it all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 59]: `` Well , '' says Stapleton , taking the pipe out of his mouth , `` I know a fact , much of a muchness with that , which happened to me when I was below the river , tending a ship at Sheerness -- for at one time , d'ye see , I used to ply there .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 16]: She was an old fifty-gun ship , called the Adamant , if I recollect right .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 45]: One day the first lieutenant , who , like yourn , was a mighty particular sort of chap , was going round the maindeck , and he sees an old pair of canvas trowsers stowed in under the trunnion of one of the guns .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 10]: So says he , ` Whose be these ? '
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 26]: Now , no man would answer , because they knowed very well that it would be as good as a fortnight in the black list .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 22]: With that , the first lieutenant bundles them out of the port , and away they floats astern with the tide .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 61]: It was about half-an-hour after that , that I comes off with the milk for the wardroom mess , and a man named Will Heaviside says to me , ` Stapleton , ' says he , ` the first lieutenant has thrown my canvas trowsers overboard , and be damned to him ; now I must have them back . '
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 7]: ` But where be they ? '
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 24]: says I : ` I suppose down at the bottom by this time , and the flat-fish dubbing their noses into them . '
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 59]: ` No , no , ' says he , ` they wo 'n' t never sink , but float till eternity ; they be gone down with the tide , and they will come back again ; only you keep a sharp look-out for them , and I 'll give you five shillings if you bring them . '
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 42]: Well , I seed little chance of ever seeing them again , or of my seeing five shillings , but as it so happened next tide , the very ` denticle pair of trowsers comes up staring me in the face .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 25]: I pulls them in , and takes them to Will Heaviside , who appears to be mightily pleased , and gives me the money .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 21]: ` I would n't have lost them for ten , no , not fur twenty pounds , ' says he .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 22]: ` At all events you 've paid me more than they are worth , ' says I. ` Have I ? '
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 47]: says he ; ` stop a bit ; ' and he outs with his knife , and rips open the waistband , and pulls out a piece of linen , and out of the piece of linen he pulls out a _ child 's caul _ .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 35]: ` There , ' says he , ` now you knows why the trowsers would n't sink , and I 'll leave you to judge whether they ar 'n' t worth five shillings . '
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 6]: That 's my story . ''
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 24]: `` Well , I ca n't understand how it is , that a caul should keep people up , '' observed old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 23]: `` At all events , a _ call _ makes people come up fast enough on board a man-of-war , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 25]: `` That 's true enough , but I 'm talking of a child 's caul , not of a boatswain 's , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 29]: `` I 'll just tell you how it is , '' replied Stapleton , who had recommenced smoking ; `` it 's _ human natur ' _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 9]: `` What is your opinion , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 6]: said Mary to the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 26]: `` Maiden , '' replied the Dominie , taking his pipe out of his mouth , `` I opine that it 's a vulgar error .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 47]: Sir Thomas Brown , I think it is , hath the same idea ; many and strange were the superstitions which have been handed down by our less enlightened ancestors -- all of which mists have been cleared away by the powerful rays of truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 39]: `` Well , but , master , if a vulgar error saves a man from Davy Jones 's locker , ar 'n' t it just as well to sew it up in the waistband of your trowsers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 19]: `` Granted , good Dux ; if it would save a man ; but how is it possible ?
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 11]: it is contrary to the first elements of science . ''
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 15]: `` What matter does that make , provided it holds a man up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 9]: `` Friend Dux , thou art obtuse . ''
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 17]: `` Well , perhaps I am , as I do n't know what that is . ''
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 27]: `` But , father , do n't you recollect , '' interrupted Tom , `` what the parson said last Sunday , that faith saved men ?
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 25]: Now , Master Dominie , may it not be faith that a man has in the _ caul _ which may save him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 9]: `` Young Tom , thou art astute . ''
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 20]: `` Well , perhaps I am , as father said , for I do n't know what that is .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 10]: You knock us all down with your dictionary . ''
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 24]: `` Well I do love to hear people make use of such hard words , '' said Mary , looking at the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 10]: `` How very clever you must be , sir !
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 10]: I wonder whether I shall ever understand them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 46]: `` Nay , if thou wilt , I will initiate -- sweet maiden , wilt steal an hour or so to impregnate thy mind with the seeds of learning , which , in so fair a soil , must needs bring forth good fruit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 24]: `` That 's a fine word , that _ impregnate _ -- will you give us the English of it , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 7]: said young Tom to the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 18]: `` It is English , Tom , only the old gentleman _ razeed _ it a little .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 34]: The third ship in the lee line of the Channel fleet was a eighty , called the _ Impregnable _ , but the old gentleman knows more about books than sea matters . ''
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 10]: `` A marvellous misconception , '' quoth the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 18]: `` There 's another , '' cried Tom , laughing ; `` that must be a three-decker .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 20]: Come , father , here 's the bottle , you must take another glass to wash that down . ''
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 31]: `` Pray what was the meaning of that last long word , sir , '' said Mary , taking the Dominie by the arm , `` mis -- something . ''
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 47]: `` The word , '' replied the Dominie , `` is a compound from conception , borrowed from the Latin tongue implying conceiving ; and the _ mis _ prefixed , which negatives or reverses the meaning ; misconception , therefore , implies not to conceive .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 73]: I can make you acquainted with many others of a similar tendency as _ mis _ - conception ; videlicet , _ mis _ - apprehension , _ mis _ - understanding , _ mis _ - contriving _ mis _ - applying , _ mis _ -- '' `` Dear me , what a many _ misses _ , '' cried Mary , `` and do you know them all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 31]: `` Indeed do I , '' replied the Dominie , `` and many , many more are treasured in my memory , _ quod nunc describere tongum est _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 27]: `` I 'd no idea that the old gentleman was given to running after the girls in that way , '' said old Tom to Stapleton .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 10]: `` Human natur ' , '' replied the other .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 36]: `` No more did I , '' continued Mary ; `` I shall have nothing to say to him ; '' and she drew off her chair a few inches from that of the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 16]: `` Maiden , '' quoth the Dominie , `` thou art under a mistake . ''
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 13]: `` Another miss , I declare , '' cried Tom , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 7]: `` What an old Turk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 7]: continued Mary , getting further off .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 59]: `` Nay , then , I will not reply , '' said the Dominie indignantly , putting down his pipe , leaning back on his chair , and pulling out his great red handkerchief , which he applied to his nose , and produced a sound that made the windows of the little parlour vibrate for some seconds .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 29]: `` I say , master Tom , do n't you make too free with your betters , '' said old Tom , when he saw the Dominie affronted .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 30]: `` Nay , '' replied the Dominie , `` there 's an old adage which saith , ` As the old cock crows , so doth the young . '
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 9]: Wherefore didst thou set him the example ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 22]: `` Very true , old gentleman , and I axes your pardon , and here 's my hand upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 31]: `` And so do I , sir , and here 's my hand upon it , '' said young Tom , extending his hand on the Dominie 's other side .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 41]: `` Friend Dux , and thou , young Tom , I do willingly accept thy proffered reconciliation ; knowing , as I well do , that there may be much mischief in thy composition , but naught of malice . ''
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 15]: The Dominie extended his hands , and shook both those offered to him warmly .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 22]: `` There , '' said old Tom , `` now my mind 's at ease , as old Pigtown said . ''
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 15]: `` I know not the author whom thou quotest from , good Dux . ''
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 3]: `` Author !
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 35]: -- I never said he was an author ; he was only captain of a schooner , trading between the islands , that I sailed with a few weeks in the West Indies . ''
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 47]: `` Perhaps , then , you will relate to the company present the circumstances which took place to put old Pegtop 's -- -LRB- I may not be correct in the name -RRB- -- but whoever it may be -- '' `` Pigtown , master . ''
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 36]: `` Well , then -- that put old Pigtown 's mind at ease -- for I am marvellously amused with thy narrations , which do pass away the time most agreeably , good Dux . ''
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 18]: `` With all my heart , old gentleman ; but first let us fill up our tumblers .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 82]: I do n't know how it is , but it does appear to me that grog drinks better out of a glass than out of metal and if it was n't that Tom is so careless -- and the dog has no respect for crockery any more than persons -- I would have one or two on board for particular service ; but I 'll think about that , and hear what the old woman has to say on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 5]: Now to my yarn .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 39]: D'ye see , old Pigtown commanded a little schooner , which plied between the isles , and he had been in her for a matter of forty years , and was as well-known as Port Royal Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 9]: `` Who might Port Royal Tom be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 11]: inquired the Dominie ; `` a relation of yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 46]: `` I hope not , master , for I wanted none of his acquaintance ; he was a shark about twenty feet long who rode guard in the harbour , to prevent the men-of-war 's men from deserting , and was pensioned by government . ''
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 5]: `` Pensioned by government !
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 7]: nay , but that soundeth strangely .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 19]: I have heard that pensions have been most lavishly bestowed , but not that it extended so far .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 11]: Truly it must have been a _ sinecure _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 104]: `` I do n't know what that last may be , '' replied old Tom , `` but I heard our boatswain , in the _ Minerve _ , who talked politics a bit , say , ` as how half the pensions were held by a pack of damned sharks ; ' but in this here shark 's case , it was n't in money , master ; but he 'd regular rations of bullock 's liver to persuade him to remain in the harbour , and no one dare swim on shore when he was cruising round and round the ships .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 57]: Well , old Pigtown , with his white trousers and straw hat , red nose and big belly , was as well-known as could be , and was a capital old fellow for remembering and executing commissions , provided you gave him the money first ; if not , he always took care to forget them .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 62]: Old Pigtown had a son , a little dark or so , which proved that his mother was n't quite as fair as a lily , and this son was employed in a drogher , that is , a small craft which goes round to the bays of the island , and takes off the sugars to the West India traders .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 19]: One fine day the drogher was driven out to sea , and never heard of a ` terwards .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 84]: Now , old Pigtown was very anxious about what had come of his son , and day after day expected he would come back again ; but he never did , for very good reasons , as you shall hear by-and-by ; and every one knowing old Pigtown , and he knowing everybody , it was at least fifty times a day that the question was put to him , ` Well , Pigtown , have you heard anything of your son ? '
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 24]: And fifty times a day he would reply , ` No ; and _ my mind 's but ill at ease _ . '
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 71]: Well , it was two or three months afterwards , that when I was in the schooner with him , as we lay becalmed between the islands , with the sun frizzing our wigs , and the planks so hot that you could n't walk without your shoes , that we hooked a large shark which came bowling under our counter , got him on board and cut him up .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 14]: When we opened his inside , what should I see but something shining .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 14]: I took it out , and sure enough it was a silver watch .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 8]: So I hands it to old Pigtown .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 26]: He looks at it very ` tentively , opens the outside case , reads the maker 's name , and then shuts it up again .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 16]: ` This here watch , ' says he , ` belonged to my son Jack .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 36]: I bought it of a chap in a South whaler for three dollars and a roll of pigtail , and a very good watch it was , though I perceive it to be stopped now .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 51]: Now , d'ye see , it 's all clear -- the drogher must have gone down in a squall -- the shark must have picked up my son Jack , and must have _ digested _ his body , but has not been able to _ digest _ his watch .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 22]: Now I knows what 's become of him , and so -- _ my mind 's at ease _ . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 53]: `` Well , '' observed old Stapleton , `` I agrees with old Poptown , or whatever his name might be , that it were better to know the worst at once than to be kept on the worry all your days ; I consider it 's nothing but human natur ' .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 35]: Why , if one has a bad tooth , which is the best plan , to have it out with one good wrench , or to be eternally tormented , night and day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 30]: `` Thou speakest wisely , friend Stapleton , and like a man of resolve -- the anticipation is often , if not always , more painful than the reality .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 54]: Thou knowest , Jacob , how often I have allowed a boy to remain unbuttoned in the centre of the room for an hour previous to the application of the birch -- and it was with the consideration that the impression would be greater upon his mind than even upon his nether parts .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 27]: All of the feelings in the human breast , that of suspense is -- '' `` Worse than _ hanging _ , '' interrupted young Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 47]: `` Even so , boy -LSB- _ cluck , cluck _ -RSB- , an apt comparison , seeing that in suspense you are hanging , as it were , in the very region of doubt , without being able to obtain a footing even upon conjecture .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 61]: Nay , we may further add another simile , although not so well borne out , which is , that the agony of suspense doth stop the breath of a man for the time , as hanging doth stop it altogether , so that it may be truly said , that suspense is put an end to by suspending . ''
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 8]: -LSB- _ cluck , cluck _ . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 26]: `` And now that you 've got rid of all that , master , suppose you fill up your pipe , '' observed old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 28]: `` And I will fill up your tumbler , sir , '' said Mary ; `` for you must be dry with talking such hard words . ''
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 33]: The Dominie this time made no objection , and again enveloped Mary and himself in a cloud of smoke , through which his nose loomed like an Indiaman in a Channel fog .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 64]: THE DOMINIE 'S BOSOM GROWS TOO WARM ; SO THE PARTY AND THE FROST BREAK UP -- I GO WITH THE STREAM AND AGAINST IT ; MAKE MONEY BOTH WAYS -- COOLNESS BETWEEN MARY AND ME -- NO CHANCE OF A THAMES ' EDITION OF ABELARD AND ELOISE -- LOVE , LEARNING , AND LATIN ALL LOST IN A FIT OF THE SULKS .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 52]: `` I say , Master Stapleton , suppose we were to knock out half a port , '' observed old Tom , after a silence of two minutes ; `` for the old gentleman blows a devil of a cloud : that is , if no one has an objection . ''
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 20]: Stapleton gave a nod of assent , and I rose and put the upper window down a few inches .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 21]: `` Ay , that 's right , Jacob ; now we shall see what Miss Mary and he are about .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 20]: You 've been enjoying the lady all to yourself , master , '' continued Tom , addressing the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 18]: `` Verily and truly , '' replied the Dominie , `` even as a second Jupiter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 7]: `` Never heard of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 24]: `` I presume not ; still , Jacob will tell thee that the history is to be found in Ovid 's Metamorphoses . ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 10]: `` Never heard of the country , master . ''
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 34]: `` Nay , friend Dux , it is a book , not a country , in which thou may ` st read how Jupiter at first descended unto Semele in a cloud . ''
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 13]: `` And pray , where did he come from , master ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 7]: `` He came from heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 6]: `` The devil he did .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 14]: Well , if ever I gets there , I mean to stay . ''
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 30]: `` It was love , all-powerful love , which induced him , maiden , '' replied the Dominie , turning , with a smiling eye , to Mary . ''
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 11]: ` Bove my comprehension altogether , '' replied old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 17]: `` Human natur ' , '' muttered Stapleton , with the pipe still between his lips .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 18]: `` Not the first vessels that have run foul in a fog , '' observed young Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 19]: `` No , boy ; but generally there ar 'n' t much love between them at those times .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 18]: But , come , now that we can breathe again , suppose I give you a song .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 19]: What shall it be , young woman , a sea ditty , or something _ spooney _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 24]: `` Oh , something about love , if you 've no objection , sir , '' said Mary , appealing to the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 15]: `` Nay , it pleaseth me maiden , and I am of thy mind .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 9]: Friend Dux , let it be Anacreontic . ''
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 8]: `` What the devil 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 18]: cried old Tom , lifting up his eyes , and taking the pipe out of his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 31]: `` Nothing of your own , father , that 's clear ; but something to borrow , for it 's to be _ on tick _ , '' replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 21]: `` Nay , boy , I would have been understood that the song should refer to women or wine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 19]: `` Both of which are to his fancy , '' observed young Tom to me , aside . ''
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 11]: _ Human natur ' _ , '' quaintly observed Stapleton .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 11]: `` Well , then , you shall have your wish .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 24]: I 'll give you one that might be warbled in a lady 's chamber without stirring the silk curtains : -- `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 28]: the days are gone when beauty bright My heart 's chain wove , When my dream of life from morn to night Was Love -- still Love .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 33]: New hope may bloom , and days may come , Of milder , calmer beam , But there 's nothing half so sweet in life As Love 's young dream ; Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 16]: there 's nothing half so sweet in life , As Love 's young dream . ''
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 29]: The melody of the song , added to the spirits he had drunk and Mary 's eyes beaming on him , had a great effect upon the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 35]: As old Tom warbled out , so did the pedagogue gradually approach the chair of Mary ; and as gradually entwine her waist with his own arm , his eyes twinkling brightly on her .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 41]: Old Tom , who perceived it , had given me and Tom a wink , as he repeated the two last lines ; and then we saw what was going on , we burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 3]: `` Boys !
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 3]: boys ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 32]: said the Dominie , starting up , `` thou hast awakened me , by thy boisterous mirth , from a sweet musing created by the harmony of friend Dux 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 20]: Neither do I discover the source of thy cachinnation , seeing that the song is amatory and not comic .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 27]: Still , it may not be supposed , at thy early age , that thou canst be affected with what thou art too young to feel .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 17]: Pr ` ythee continue , friend Dux , and , boys , restrain thy mirth . ''
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 74]: `` Though the bard to a purer fame may soar When wild youth 's past , Though he win the wise , who frowned before , To smile at last , He 'll never meet a joy so sweet In all his noon of fame , As when first he sung to woman 's ear His soul-felt flame ; And at every close she blush 'd to hear The once-lov 'd name . ''
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 51]: At the commencement of this verse the Dominie appeared to be on his guard ; but gradually moved by the power of song , he dropped his elbow on the table , and his pipe underneath it ; his forehead sank into his broad palm , and he remained motionless .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 23]: The verse ended , and the Dominie , forgetting all around him , softly ejaculated , without looking up , `` Eheu !
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 3]: Mary . ''
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 10]: `` Did you speak to me , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 19]: said Mary , who , perceiving us tittering , addressed the Dominie with a half-serious , half-mocking air .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 5]: `` Speak , maiden ?
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 28]: nay , I spoke not ; yet thou mayest give me my pipe , which apparently hath been abducted while I was listening to the song . ''
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 3]: `` Abducted !
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 22]: that 's a new word ; but it means smashed into twenty pieces , I suppose , '' observed young Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 19]: `` At all events , your pipe is , for you let it fall between your legs . ''
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 27]: `` Never mind , '' said Mary , rising from her chair , and going to the cupboard ; `` here 's another , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 19]: `` Well , master , am I to finish , or have you had enough of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 17]: `` Proceed , friend Dux , proceed ; and believe that I am all attention . ''
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 27]: `` Oh , that hallowed form is ne'er forgot Which first love trac 'd , Still it lingering haunts the greenest spot On memory 's waste .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 48]: 'T was odour fled as soon as shed , 'T was memory 's winged dream , 'T was a light that ne'er can shine again On life 's dull stream ; Oh , 't was light that ne'er can shine again On life 's dull stream . ''
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 18]: `` Nay , '' said the Dominie , again abstracted , `` the metaphor is not just .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 9]: ` _ Life 's _ dull stream . '
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 30]: ` _ Lethe tacitus amnis _ , ' as Lucan hath it ; but the stream of life flows -- ay , flows rapidly -- even in my veins .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 20]: Doth not the heart throb and beat -- yea , strongly -- peradventure too forcibly against my better judgment ?
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 15]: ` _ Confiteor misere molle cor esse mihi _ , ' as Ovid saith .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 6]: Yet must it not prevail !
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 9]: Shall one girl be victorious over seventy boys ?
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 10]: Shall I , Dominie Dobbs , desert my post ?
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 22]: -- Again succumb to -- I will even depart , that I may be at my desk at matutinal hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 12]: `` You do n't mean to leave us , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 9]: said Mary , taking the Dominie 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 30]: `` Even so , fair maiden , for it waxeth late , and I have my duties to perform , '' said the Dominie , rising from his chair .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 10]: `` Then you will promise to come again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 6]: `` Peradventure I may . ''
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 20]: `` If you do not promise me that you will , I will not let you go now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 13]: `` Verily , maiden -- '' `` Promise , '' interrupted Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 13]: `` Truly , maiden -- '' `` Promise , '' cried Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 22]: `` In good sooth , maiden -- '' `` Promise , '' reiterated Mary , pulling the Dominie towards her chair .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 21]: `` Nay , then , I do promise , since thou wilt have it so , '' replied the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 8]: `` And when will you come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 20]: `` I will not tarry , '' replied the Dominie ; `` and now good night to all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 13]: The Dominie shook hands with us , and Mary lighted him downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 80]: I was much pleased with the resolution and sense of his danger thus shown by my worthy preceptor , and hoped that he would have avoided Mary in future , who evidently wished to make a conquest of him for her own amusement and love of admiration ; but still I felt that the promise exacted would be fulfilled , and I was afraid that a second meeting , and that perhaps not before witnesses , would prove mischievous .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 34]: I made up my mind to speak to Mary on the subject as soon as I had an opportunity , and insist upon her not making a fool of the worthy old man .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 37]: Mary remained below a much longer time than was necessary , and when she re-appeared and looked at me , as if for a smile of approval , I turned from her with a contemptuous air .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 8]: She sat down , and looked confused .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 11]: Tom was also silent , and paid her no attention .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 25]: A quarter of an hour passed , when he proposed to his father that they should be off , and the party broke up .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 22]: Leaving Mary silent and thoughtful , and old Stapleton finishing his pipe , I took my candle and went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 18]: The next day the moon changed , the weather changed , and a rapid thaw took place .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 39]: `` It 's an ill wind that blows nobody good , '' observed old Stapleton ; `` we watermen will have the river to ourselves again , and the hucksters must carry their gingerbread-nuts to another market . ''
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 47]: It was , however , three or four days before the river was clear of the ice , so as to permit the navigation to proceed ; and during that time , I may as well observe , that there was dissension between Mary and me .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 39]: I showed her that I resented her conduct , and at first she tried to pacify me ; but finding that I held out longer than she expected , she turned round , and was affronted in return .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 30]: Short words and no lessons were the order of the day ; and as each party seemed determined to hold out , there was little prospect of a reconciliation .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 24]: In this she was the greatest sufferer , as I quitted the house after breakfast , and did not return until dinner time .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 40]: At first old Stapleton plied very regularly , and took all the fares ; but about a fortnight after we had worked together , he used to leave me to look after employment , and remain at the public-house .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 33]: The weather was now fine , and , after the severe frost , it changed so rapidly that most of the trees were in leaf , and the horse-chestnuts in full blossom .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 22]: The wherry was in constant demand , and every evening I handed from four to six shillings over to old Stapleton .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 79]: I was delighted with my life , and should have been perfectly happy if it had not been for my quarrel with Mary still continuing , she as resolutely refraining from making advances as I. How much may life be embittered by dissension with those you live with , even when there is no very warm attachment ; the constant grating together worries and annoys , and although you may despise the atoms , the aggregate becomes insupportable .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 43]: I had no pleasure in the house ; and the evenings , which formerly passed so agreeably , were now a source of vexation , from being forced to sit in company with one with whom I was not on good terms .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 16]: Old Stapleton was seldom at home till late , and this made it still worse .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 47]: I was communing with myself one night , as I had my eyes fixed on my book , whether I should make the first advances , when Mary , who had been quietly at work , broke the silence by asking me what I was reading .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 7]: I replied in a quiet tone .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 26]: `` Jacob , '' said she , in continuation , `` I think you have used me very ill to humble me in this manner .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 11]: It was your business to make it up first . ''
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 32]: `` I am not aware that I have been in the wrong , '' replied I. `` I do not say that you have ; but what matter does that make ?
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 10]: You ought to give way to a woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 5]: `` Why so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 4]: `` Why so !
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 8]: do n't the whole world do so ?
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 10]: Do you not offer everything first to a woman ?
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 7]: Is it not her right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 12]: `` Not when she is in the wrong , Mary . ''
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 27]: `` Yes , when she 's in the wrong , Jacob ; there 's no merit in doing it when she 's in the right . ''
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 34]: `` I think otherwise ; at all events , it depends on how much she has been in the wrong , and I consider you have shown a bad heart , Mary . ''
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 5]: `` A bad heart !
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 7]: in what way , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 31]: `` In realising the fable of the boys and the frogs with the poor old Dominie , forgetting that what may be sport to you is death to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 20]: `` You do n't mean to say that he 'll die of love , '' replied Mary , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 27]: `` I should hope not : but you may contrive , and you have tried all in your power , to make him very wretched . ''
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 20]: `` And , pray , how do you know that I do not like the old gentleman , Jacob ?
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 17]: You appear to think that a girl is to fall in love with nobody but yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 13]: Why should I not love an old man with so much learning ?
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 31]: I have been told that old husbands are much prouder of their wives than young ones , and pay them more attention , and do n't run after other women .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 11]: How do you know that I am not serious ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 16]: `` Because I know your character , Mary , and am not to be deceived .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 19]: If you mean to defend yourself in that way , we had better not talk any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 8]: `` Lord , how savage you are !
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 12]: then , suppose I did pay the old gentleman any attention .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 8]: Did the young ones pay me any ?
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 18]: Did either you , or your precious friend , Mr Tom , even speak to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 18]: `` No ; we saw how you were employed , and we both hate a jilt . ''
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 6]: `` Oh , you do .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 10]: Very well , sir ; just as you please .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 15]: I may make both your hearts ache for this some day or another . ''
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 22]: `` Forewarned , forearmed , Mary ; and I shall take care that they are both forewarned as well as myself .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 15]: As I perceive that you are so decided , I shall say no more .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 16]: Only , for your own sake , and your own happiness , I caution you .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 14]: Recollect your mother , Mary , and recollect your mother 's death . ''
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 9]: Mary covered her face and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 13]: She sobbed for a few minutes , and then came to me .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 31]: `` You are right , Jacob ; and I am a foolish -- perhaps wicked -- girl ; but forgive me , and indeed I will try to behave better .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 25]: But , as father says , it is human nature in me , and it 's hard to conquer our natures , Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 17]: `` Will you promise me not to continue your advances to the Dominie , Mary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 13]: `` I will not , if I can help it , Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 15]: I may forget for the moment , but I 'll do all I can .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 21]: It 's not very easy to look grave when one is merry , or sour when one is pleased . ''
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 18]: `` But what can induce you , Mary , to practise upon an old man like him ?
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 11]: If it were young Tom , I could understand it .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 37]: There might be some credit , and your pride might be flattered by the victory ; but an old man -- '' `` Still , Jacob , old or young , it 's much the same .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 17]: I would like to have them all at my feet , and that 's the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 6]: I ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 31]: And I thought it a great victory to bring there a wise old man , who was so full of Latin and learning , and who ought to know better .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 27]: Tell me Jacob , if old men a how themselves to be caught , as well as young , where is the crime of catching them ?
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 46]: Is n't there as much vanity in an old man , in his supposing that I really could love him , as there is in me , who am but a young , foolish girl , in trying to make him fond of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 43]: `` That may be ; but still recollect that he is in earnest , and you are only joking , which makes a great difference ; and recollect further , that in trying at all , we very often lose all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 42]: `` That I would take my chance of , Jacob , '' replied Mary , proudly throwing her curly ringlets back with her hand from her white forehead ; `` but what I now want is to make friends with you .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 14]: Come , Jacob , you have my promise to do my best . ''
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 17]: `` Yes , Mary , and I believe you , so there 's my hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 91]: `` You do n't know how miserable I have been , Jacob , since we quarrelled , '' said Mary , wiping the tears away , which again commenced flowing ; `` and yet I do n't know why , for I 'm sure I have almost hated you this last week -- that I have ; but the fact is , I like quarrelling very well for the pleasure of making it up again ; but not for the quarrel to last so long as this has done . ''
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 19]: `` It has annoyed me too , Mary , for I like you very much in general . ''
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 24]: `` Well , then , now it 's all over ; but Jacob , are you sure you are friends with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 6]: `` Yes , Mary . ''
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 6]: Mary looked archly at me .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 16]: `` You know the old saw , and I feel the truth of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 11]: `` What , ` kiss and make friends ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 22]: replied I ; `` with all my heart , '' and I kissed her , without any resistance on her part .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 12]: `` No , I did n't mean that , Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 5]: `` What then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 5]: 't was another . ''
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 11]: `` Well , then , what was the other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 20]: `` Never mind , I forget it now , '' said she laughing , and rising from the chair .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 26]: `` Now , I must go to my work again , and you must tell me what you 've been doing this last fortnight . ''
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 22]: Mary and I entered into a long and amicable conversation till her father came home , when we retired to bed .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 41]: `` I think , '' said old Stapleton , the next morning , `` that I 've had work enough ; and I 've belonged to two benefit clubs for so long as to ` title me to an allowance .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 33]: I think , Jacob , I shall give up the wherry to you , and you shall in future give me one-third of your earnings , and keep the rest to yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 16]: I do n't see why you 're to work hard all day for nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 20]: I remonstrated against this excess of liberality ; but old Stapleton was positive , and the arrangement was made .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 23]: I afterwards discovered , what may probably occur to the reader , that Captain Turnbull was at the bottom of all this .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 41]: He had pensioned old Stapleton that I might become independent by my own exertions before I had served my apprenticeship ; and after breakfast , old Stapleton walked down with me to the beach , and we launched the boat .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 41]: `` Recollect , Jacob , '' said he , `` one-third , and honour bright ; '' so saying , he adjourned to his old quarters , the public-house , to smoke his pipe and think of human natur ' .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 28]: I do not recollect any day of my life on which I felt more happy than on this : I was working for myself , and independent .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 108]: I jumped into my wherry , and , without waiting for a fare , I pushed off , and , gaining the stream , cleaved through the water with delight as my reward ; but after a quarter of an hour I sobered down with the recollection that , although I might pull about for nothing for my own amusement , that as Stapleton was entitled to one-third , I had no right to neglect his interest ; and I shot my wherry into the row , and stood with my hand and fore-finger raised , watching the eye of every one who came towards the hard .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 24]: I was fortunate that day , and when I returned , was proceeding to give Stapleton his share , when he stopped me .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 16]: `` Jacob , it 's no use dividing now ; once a-week will be better .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 27]: I likes things to come in a lump ; cause , d'ye see -- it 's -- it 's -- _ human natur ' _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 53]: A GOOD FARE -- EAT YOUR PUDDING AND HOLD YOUR TONGUE -- THE DOMINIE CROSSED IN LOVE -- THE CROSSER ALSO CROSSED -- I FIND THAT `` ALL THE WORLD 'S A STAGE , '' NOT EXCEPTING THE STERN SHEETS OF MY WHERRY -- CLEOPATRA 'S BARGE APOSTROPHISED ON THE RIVER THAMES .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 20]: I consider that the present was the period from which I might date my first launching into human life .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 32]: I was now nearly eighteen years old , strong , active , and well-made , full of spirits , and overjoyed at the independence which I had so much sighed for .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 16]: Since the period of my dismissal from Mr Drummond 's my character had much altered .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 34]: I had become grave and silent , brooding over my wrongs , harbouring feelings of resentment against the parties , and viewing the world in general through a medium by no means favourable .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 56]: I had become in some degree restored from this unwholesome state of mind from having rendered an important service to Captain Turnbull , for we love the world better as we feel that we are more useful in it ; but the independence now given to me was the acme of my hopes and wishes .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 29]: I felt so happy , so buoyant in mind , that I could even think of the two clerks in Mr Drummond 's employ without feelings of revenge .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 18]: Let it , however , be remembered that the world was all before me in anticipation only .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 6]: `` Boat , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 8]: `` No , thanky , my lad .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 10]: I want old Stapleton -- is he here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 12]: `` No , sir , but this is his boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 11]: `` Humph , ca n't he take me down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 14]: `` No , sir ; but I can , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 9]: `` Well , then , be quick . ''
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 34]: A sedate-looking gentleman , about forty-five years of age , stepped into the boat , and in a few seconds I was in the stream , shooting the bridge with the ebbing tide .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 10]: `` What 's the matter with deaf Stapleton ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 21]: `` Nothing , sir ; but he 's getting old , and has made the boat over to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 7]: `` Are you his son ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 10]: `` No , sir , his ` prentice . ''
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 3]: `` Humph !
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 7]: sorry deaf Stapleton 's gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 17]: `` I can be as deaf as he , sir , if you wish it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 44]: The gentleman said no more at the time , and I pulled down the river in silence ; but in a few minutes he began to move his hands up and down , and his lips , as if he was in conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 10]: Gradually his action increased , and words were uttered .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 63]: At last he broke out : -- `` It is with this conviction , I may say important conviction , Mr Speaker , that I now deliver my sentiments to the Commons ' house of Parliament , trusting that no honourable member will decide until he has fully weighed the importance of the arguments which I have submitted to his judgment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 70]: He then stopped , as if aware that I was present , and looked at me ; but , prepared as I was , there was nothing in my countenance which exhibited the least sign of merriment ; or , indeed , of having paid any attention to what he had been saying , for I looked carelessly to the right and left at the banks of the river .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 6]: He again entered into conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 10]: `` Have you been long on the river ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 8]: `` Born on it , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 12]: `` How do you like the profession of a waterman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 16]: `` Very well , sir ; the great point is to have regular customers . ''
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 9]: `` And how do you gain them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 14]: `` By holding my tongue ; keeping their counsel and my own . ''
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 8]: `` Very good answer , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 18]: People who have much to do can not afford to loose even their time on the water .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 17]: Just now I was preparing and thinking over my speech in the House of Commons . ''
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 43]: `` So I supposed , sir , and I think the river is a very good place for it , as no one can overhear you except the person whose services you have hired -- and you need not mind him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 24]: `` Very true , my lad ; but that 's why I liked deaf Stapleton : he could not hear a word . ''
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 39]: `` But sir , if you 've no objection , I like to hear it very much ; and you may be sure that I should never say anything about it , if you will trust me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 6]: `` Do you my lad ?
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 11]: well , then I 'll just try it over again .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 19]: You shall be the speaker -- mind you hold your tongue , and do n't interrupt me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 86]: The gentleman then began : `` Mr Speaker , I should not have ventured to address the House at this late hour , did I not consider that the importance of the question now before it is -- so important -- no , that wo n't do -- did I not consider that the question now before it is of that , I may say , paramount importance as to call forth the best energies of every man who is a well-wisher to his country .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 35]: With this conviction , Mr Speaker , humble individual as I am , I feel it my duty , I may say , my bounden duty , to deliver my sentiments upon the subject .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 52]: The papers which I now hold in my hand , Mr Speaker , and to which I shall soon have to call the attention of the House , will , I trust , fully establish -- '' `` I say , waterman , be you taking that chap to Bedlam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 9]: cried a shrill female voice close to us .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 21]: The speech was stopped ; we looked up , and perceived a wherry with two females passing close to us .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 16]: A shout of laughter followed the observation , and my fare looked very much confused .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 32]: I had often read the papers in the public-house , and remembering what was usual in the house in case of interruption , called out , `` Order , order ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 30]: This made the gentleman laugh , and as the other wherry was now far off , he recommenced his oration , with which I shall not trouble my readers .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 20]: It was a very fair speech , I have no doubt , but I forget what it was about .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 13]: I landed him at Westminster Bridge , and received treble my fare .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 35]: `` Recollect , '' said he , on paying me , `` that I shall look out for you when I come again , which I do every Monday morning , and sometimes oftener .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 6]: What 's your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 6]: `` Jacob , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 11]: `` Very well ; good morning , my lad . ''
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 52]: This gentleman became a very regular and excellent customer , and we used to have a great deal of conversation , independent of debating , in the wherry ; and I must acknowledge that I received from him not only plenty of money , but a great deal of valuable information .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 19]: A few days after this I had an opportunity of ascertaining how far Mary would keep her promise .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 43]: I was plying at the river side as usual , when old Stapleton came up to me , with his pipe in his mouth , and said , `` Jacob , there be that old gentleman up at our house with Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 13]: Now , I sees a great deal , but I says nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 12]: Mary will be her mother over again , that 's sartain .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 20]: Suppose you go and see your old teacher , and leave me to look a ` ter a customer .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 18]: I begin to feel as if handling the sculls a little would be of sarvice to me .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 40]: We all think idleness be a very pleasant thing when we 're obliged to work but when we are idle , then we feel that a little work be just as agreeable -- that 's human natur ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 33]: I thought that Mary was very likely to forget all her good resolutions , from her ardent love of admiration , and I was determined to go and break up the conference .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 16]: I , therefore , left the boat to Stapleton , and hastened to the house .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 54]: I did not like to play the part of an eavesdropper , and was quite undecided how I should act ; whether to go in at once or not , when , as I passed under the window , which was open , I heard very plainly the conversation that was going on .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 145]: I stopped in the street , and listened to the Dominie in continuation -- `` But , fair maiden , _ omnia vincit amor _ -- here am I , Dominie Dobbs , who have long passed the grand climacteric , and can already muster three score years -- who have authority over seventy boys , being Magister Princeps et Dux of Brentford Grammar School -- who have affectioned only the sciences , and communed only with the classics -- who have ever turned a deaf ear to the allurements of thy sex , and ever hardened my heart to thy fascination -- here am I , even I , Dominie Dobbs , suing at the feet of a maiden who had barely ripened into womanhood , who knoweth not to read or write , and whose father earns his bread by manual labour .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 37]: I feel it all -- I feel that I am too old -- that thou art too young -- that I am departing from the ways of wisdom , and am regardless of my worldly prospects .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 24]: Still , _ omnia vincit amor _ , and I bow to the all-powerful god , doing him homage through thee , Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 32]: Vainly have I resisted -- vainly have I , as I have lain in bed , tried to drive thee from my thoughts , and tear thine image from my heart .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 8]: Have I not felt thy presence everywhere ?
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 37]: Do not I astonish my worthy coadjutor , Mistress Bately , the matron , by calling her by the name of Mary , when I had always before addressed her by her baptismal name of Deborah ?
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 26]: Nay , have not the boys in the classes discovered my weakness , and do they not shout out Mary in the hours of play ?
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 12]: _ Mare periculosum et turbidum _ hast thou been to me .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 35]: I sleep not -- I eat not -- and every sign of love which hath been adduced by Ovidius Naso , whom I have diligently collated , do I find in mine own person .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 6]: Speak , then , maiden .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 27]: I have given vent to my feelings , do thou the same , that I may return , and leave not my flock without their shepherd .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 5]: Speak , maiden . ''
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 23]: `` I will , sir , if you will get up , '' replied Mary , who paused , and then continued .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 30]: `` I think , sir , that I am young and foolish , and you are old and -- and -- '' `` Foolish , thou wouldst say . ''
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 31]: `` I had rather you said it , sir , than I ; it is not for me to use such an expression towards one so learned as you are .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 22]: I think , sir , that I am too young to marry ; and that perhaps you are -- too old .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 50]: I think , sir , that you are too clever -- and that I am very ignorant ; that it would not suit you in your situation to marry ; and that it would not suit me to marry you -- equally obliged to you all the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 54]: `` Perhaps thou hast in thy reply proved the wiser of the two , '' answered the Dominie ; `` but why , maiden , didst thou raise those feelings , those hopes in my breast , only to cause me pain , and make me drink deep of the cup of disappointment ?
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 20]: didst thou appear to cling to me in fondness , if thou felt not a yearning towards me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 18]: `` But are there no other sorts of love besides the one you would require , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 17]: May I not love you because you are so clever , and so learned in Latin .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 12]: May I not love you as I do my father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 23]: `` True , true , child ; it is all my own folly , and I must retrace my steps in sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 14]: I have been deceived -- but I have been deceived only by myself .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 40]: My wishes have clouded my understanding , and have obscured my reason ; have made me forgetful of my advanced years , and of the little favour I was likely to find in the eyes of a young maiden .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 22]: I have fallen into a pit through blindness , and I must extricate myself , sore as will be the task .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 8]: Bless thee , maiden , bless thee !
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 16]: May another be happy in thy love , and never feel the barb of disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 15]: I will pray for thee , Mary -- that Heaven may bless thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 8]: And the Dominie turned away and wept .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 24]: Mary appeared to be moved by the good old man 's affliction , and her heart probably smote her for her coquettish behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 17]: She attempted to console the Dominie , and appeared to be more than half crying herself .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 18]: `` No , sir , do not take on so , you make me feel very uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 25]: I have been wrong -- I feel I have -- though you have not blamed me , I am a very foolish girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 10]: `` Bless thee , child -- bless thee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 9]: replied the Dominie , in a subdued voice .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 32]: `` Indeed , sir , I do n't deserve it -- I feel I do not ; but pray do not grieve , sir ; things will go cross in love .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 17]: Now , sir , I 'll tell you a secret , to prove it to you .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 51]: I love Jacob -- love him very much , and he does not care for me -- I am sure he does not ; so , you sir , you are not the only one -- who is -- very unhappy ; '' and Mary commenced sobbing with the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 5]: `` Poor thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 10]: said the Dominie ; `` and thou lovest Jacob ?
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 8]: truly is he worthy of thy love .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 18]: And , at thy early age , thou knowest what it is to have thy love unrequited .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 14]: Truly is this a vale of tears -- yet let us be thankful .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 25]: Guard well thy heart , child , for Jacob may not be for thee ; nay I feel that he will not be . ''
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 8]: `` And why so , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 5]: replied Mary , despondingly .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 25]: `` Because , maiden -- but nay , I must not tell thee ; only take my warning , Mary -- fare thee well ?
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 7]: I come not here again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 19]: `` Good-bye , sir , and pray forgive me ; this will be a warning to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 14]: `` Verily , maiden , it will be a warning to us both .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 5]: God bless thee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 27]: I discovered by the sound that Mary had vouchsafed to the Dominie a kiss , and heard soon afterwards his steps as he descended the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 24]: Not wishing to meet him I turned round the corner , and went down to the river , thinking over what had passed .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 15]: I felt pleased with Mary , but I was not in love with her .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 13]: The spring was now far advanced , and the weather was delightful .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 22]: The river was beautiful , and parties of pleasure were constantly to be seen floating up and down with the tide .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 42]: The Westminster boys , the Funny Club , and other amateurs in their fancy dresses , enlivened the scene ; while the races for prize wherries , which occasionally took place , rendered the water one mass of life and motion .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 18]: How I longed for my apprenticeship to be over , that I might try for a prize !
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 58]: One of my best customers was a young man , who was an actor at one of the theatres , who , like the M.P. , used to rehearse the whole time he was in the boat ; but he was a lively , noisy personage , full of humour , and perfectly indifferent as to appearances .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 29]: He had a quiz and a quirk for everybody that passed in another boat , and would stand up and rant at them until they considered him insane .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 29]: We were on very intimate terms , and I was never more pleased than when he made his appearance , as it was invariably the signal for mirth .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 21]: The first time I certainly considered him to be a lunatic , for playhouse phraseology was quite new to me .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 17]: `` Boat , sir , '' cried I to him as he came to the hard .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 9]: `` My affairs do even drag me homeward .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 17]: Go on ; I 'll follow thee , '' replied he , leaping into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 9]: `` Our fortune lies in this jump . ''
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 12]: I shoved off the wherry : `` Down , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 19]: `` Down , '' replied he ; pointing downwards with his finger , as if pushing at something .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 15]: `` Down , down to hell , and say I sent you there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 20]: `` Thanky , sir , I 'd rather not , if it 's all the same to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 16]: `` Our tongue is rough , coz -- and my condition is not smooth . ''
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 42]: We shot the bridge , and went rapidly down with the tide , when he again commenced : -- `` Thus with imagin 'd wing our soft scene flies , In motion of no less celerity Than that of thought . ''
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 27]: Then his attention was drawn by a collier 's boat , pulled by two men as black as chimney-sweeps , with three women in the stern-sheets .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 35]: They made for the centre of the river , to get into the strength of the tide , and were soon abreast and close to the wherry , pulling with us down the stream .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 33]: `` There 's a dandy young man , '' said one of the women , with an old straw bonnet and very dirty ribbons , laughing , and pointing to my man .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 9]: `` Plead you to me , fair dame ?
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 25]: I know you not ; At Ephesus I am but two hours old , As strange unto your town as to your talk . ''
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 111]: `` Well , he be a reg ` lar rum cove , I 've a notion , '' said another of the women , when she witnessed the theatrical airs of the speaker , who immediately recommenced -- `` The barge she sat in , like a burnish 'd throne , Burn 'd on the water -- the poop was beaten gold , Purple the sails , and so perfumed that The winds were love-sick with them ; the oars were silver , Which to the tunes of flutes kept stroke , and made The water , which they beat , to follow faster , As amorous of their strokes .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 12]: For her own person , It beggar 'd all description . ''
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 30]: `` Come , I 'll be blowed but we 've had enough of that , so just shut your pan , '' said one of the women , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 15]: `` Her gentlewomen , like the Naiades , So many mermaids tend her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 20]: `` Mind what you 're arter , or your mouth will tend to your mischief , young fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 18]: `` From the barge A strange , invisible perfume hits the sense Of the adjacent wharfs . ''
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 17]: `` Jem , just run him alongside , and break his head with your oar . ''
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 17]: `` I thinks as how I will , if he do n't mend his manners . ''
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 14]: `` I saw her once Hop forty paces through the public streets . ''
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 8]: `` You lie , you liver-faced rascal .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 9]: I never walked the streets in my life .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 7]: I 'm a lawful married woman .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 15]: Jem , do you call yourself a man , and stand this here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 15]: `` Well , now , Sal , but he 's a nice young man .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 6]: Now a n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 7]: observed one of the other women .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 8]: `` Away , Away , you trifler .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 2]: Love !
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 38]: I know thee not , I care not for thee , Kate : this is no world To play with mammets , and to tilt with lips ; We must have bloody noses and cracked crowns . ''
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 20]: `` I 've a notion you will , too , my hearty , '' interrupted one of the colliers .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 14]: `` That ` ere long tongue of yours will bring you into disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 17]: Bill , give her a jerk towards the wherry , and we 'll duck him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 27]: `` My friend , '' said the actor , addressing me : -- `` Let not his unwholesome corpse come between the wind And my nobility .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 8]: `` Let us exeunt , OP . ''
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 29]: Although I could not understand his phrases , I knew very well what he meant , and pulling smartly , I shoved towards the shore , and ahead .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 37]: Perceiving this , the men in the boat , at the intimation of the women , who stood up waving their bonnets , gave chase to us , and my companion appeared not a little alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 19]: However , by great exertion on my part , we gained considerably , and they abandoned the pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 74]: `` Now , by two-headed Janus , '' said my companion , as he looked back upon the colliers -- `` Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time , Some that will evermore peep through their eyes , And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper , And others of such a vinegar aspect That they 'll not show their teeth by way of smile , Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 19]: `` And now , '' continued he , addressing me , `` what 's your name , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 15]: Of what condition are you -- and of what place , I pray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 29]: Amused with what had passed , I replied , `` That my name was Jacob -- that I was a waterman , and born on the river . ''
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 25]: `` I find thee apt ; but tell me , art thou perfect that our ship hath touched upon the deserts of Bohemia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 10]: `` Do you land at Westminster , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 11]: `` No : at Blackfriars -- there attend my coming .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 18]: `` Base is the slave who pays ; nevertheless , what is your fare , my lad ?
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 8]: `` What money 's in my purse ?
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 5]: Seven groats and twopence .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 21]: `` By Jove , I am not covetous of gold , Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 16]: `` But -- `` I can get no remedy for this consumption of the purse .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 10]: `` Here my lad -- is that enough ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 10]: `` Yes , sir , I thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 29]: `` Remember poor Jack , sir , '' said the usual attendant at the landing place , catching his arm as he careened the wherry on getting out .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 13]: `` If he fall in , good-night -- or sink or swim .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 10]: `` Jack , there is a penny for you .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 24]: Jacob , farewell -- we meet again ; '' and away he went , taking three of the stone steps at each spring .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 24]: This gentleman 's name was , as I afterwards found out , Tinfoil , an actor of second-rate merit on the London boards .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 35]: The Haymarket Theatre was where he principally performed , and , as we became better acquainted , he offered to procure me orders to see the play when I should wish to go there .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 53]: THE PIC-NIC PARTY -- SUFFERINGS BY OIL , ICE , FIRE , AND WATER -- UPON THE WHOLE THE `` DIVARTING VAGABONDS , '' AS THE THESPIAN HEROES AND HEROINES ARE CLASSICALLY TERMED , ARE VERY HAPPY , EXCEPTING MR. WINTERBOTTOM , WHOSE FEELINGS ARE BY SITTING DOWN , DOWN TO ZERO .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 24]: One morning he came down to the hard , and , as usual , I expected that he would go down the river .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 11]: I ran to my boat , and hauled in close .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 27]: `` No , Jacob , no ; this day you will not carry Caesar and his fortunes , but I have an order for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 12]: `` Thank you ; sir ; what is the play ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 6]: `` The play -- pooh !
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 19]: no play ; but I hope it will prove a farce , nevertheless , before it 's over .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 19]: We are to have a pic-nic party upon one of those little islands up the river by Kew .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 35]: All sock and buskin , all theatricals : if the wherries upset , the Hay-market may shut up , for it will be ` _ exeunt omnes _ ' with all its best performers .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 29]: Look you , Jacob , we shall want three wherries , and I leave you to pick out the other two -- oars in each , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 38]: You must be at Whitehall steps exactly at nine o'clock , and I daresay the ladies wo n't make you wait more than an hour or two , which , for them , is tolerably punctual . ''
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 72]: Mr Tinfoil then entered into the arrangement for remuneration , and walked away ; and I was conning over in my mind whom I should select from my brother watermen , and whether I should ask old Stapleton to take the other oar in my boat , when I heard a voice never to be mistaken by me -- `` Life is like a summer day Warmed by a sunny ray .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 7]: `` Lower away yet , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 7]: That 'll do , my trump .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 13]: `` Sometimes a dreary cloud , Chill blast , or tempest loud .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 45]: `` Look out for Jacob , Tom , '' cried the old man , as the head of the lighter , with her mast lowered down , made its appearance through the arch of Putney Bridge , with bright blue streaks on her sides .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 26]: `` Here he is , father , '' replied Tom , who was standing forward by the windlass , with the fall in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 35]: I had shoved off , on hearing old Tom 's voice , and was alongside almost as soon as the lighter had passed under the bridge , and discovered old Tom at the helm .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 32]: I sprang on the deck , with the chain-painter of the wherry in my hand , made it fast , and went aft to old Tom , who seized my hand .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 19]: `` This is as it should be , my boy , both on the look-out for each other .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 13]: The heart warms when we know the feeling is on both sides .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 16]: You 're seldom out of our thoughts , boy , and always in our hearts .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 35]: Now , jump forward , for Tom 's fretting to greet you , I see , and you may just as well help him to sway up the mast when you are there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 24]: I went forward , shook hands with Tom , and then clapped on the fall , and assisted him to hoist the mast .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 26]: We then went aft to his father and communicated everything of interest which had passed since our last meeting at the house of old Stapleton .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 7]: `` And how 's Mary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 33]: inquired Tom ; `` she 's a very fine lass , and I 've thought of her more than once ; but I saw that all you said about her was true .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 10]: How she did flam the poor old Dominie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 42]: `` I have had a few words with her about it , and she has promised to be wiser , '' replied I ; `` but as her father says , ` in her it 's human natur ' . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 21]: `` She 's a fine craft , '' observed old Tom , `` and they always be a little ticklish .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 21]: But , Jacob , you 've had some inquiries made after you , and by the women , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 19]: replied I. `` Yes ; and I have had the honour of being sent for into the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 6]: Do you guess now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' said I , a gloom coming over my countenance .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 14]: `` I presume it is Drummond and Sarah whom you refer to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 4]: `` Exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 57]: Tom then informed me that Mrs Drummond had sent for him , and asked a great many questions about me , and desired him to say that they were very glad to hear that I was well and comfortable , and hoped that I would call and see her and Sarah when I came that way .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 133]: Mrs Drummond then left the room , and Tom was alone with Sarah , who desired him to say , that her father had found out that I had not been wrong ; that he had dismissed both the clerks ; and that he was very sorry he had been so deceived -- `` and then , '' said Tom , `` Miss Sarah told me to say from herself , that she had been very unhappy since you had left them , but that she hoped that you would forgive and forget some day or another , and come back to them ; and that I was to give you her love , and call next time we went up the river for something that she wanted to send to you .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 21]: So you perceive , Jacob , that you are not forgotten , and justice has been done to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 24]: `` Yes , '' replied I , `` but it has been too late ; so let us say no more about it .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 9]: I am quite happy as I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 40]: I then told them of the pic-nic party of the next day , upon which Tom volunteered to take the other oar in my boat , as he would not be wanted while the barge was at the wharf .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 19]: Old Tom gave his consent , and it was agreed he should meet me next morning at daylight .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 24]: `` I 've a notion there 'll be some fun , Jacob , '' said he , `` from what you say . ''
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 50]: `` I think so , too ; but you 've towed me two miles , and I must be off again , or I shall lose my dinner ; so good-bye ; '' I selected two other wherries in the course of the afternoon , and then returned home .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 48]: It was a lovely morning when Tom and I washed out the boat , and , having dressed ourselves in our neatest clothes , we shoved off in company with the two other wherries , and dropped leisurely down the river with the last of the ebb .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 51]: When we pulled in to the stairs at Whitehall , we found two men waiting for us with three or four hampers , some baskets , an iron saucepan , a frying-pan , and a large tin pail with a cover , full of rough ice to cool the wines .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 21]: We were directed to put all these articles into one boat ; the others to be reserved for the company .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 24]: `` Jacob , '' said Tom , `` do n't let us be kitchen ; I 'm togged out for the parlour . ''
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 31]: This point had just been arranged , and the articles put into the wherry , when the party made their appearance , Mr Tinfoil acting as master of the ceremonies .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 34]: `` Fair Titania , '' said he to the lady who appeared to demand , and therefore received , the most attention , `` allow me to hand you to your throne . ''
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 43]: `` Many thanks , good Puck , '' replied the lady ; `` we are well placed ; but dear me , we have n't brought , or we have lost , our vinaigrette ; we positively can not go without it .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 9]: What can our women have been about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 23]: `` Pease-blossom and Mustard-seed are much to blame , '' replied Tinfoil ; `` but shall I run back for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 22]: `` Yes , '' replied the lady , `` and be here again ere the leviathan can swim a league . ''
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 24]: `` I 'll put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes , '' replied the gentleman , stepping out of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 18]: `` Wo n't you be a little out of breath before you come back , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 7]: said Tom , joining the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 15]: This remark , far from giving offence , was followed by a general laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 80]: Before Mr Tinfoil was out of sight , the lost vinaigrette was dropped out of the lady 's handkerchief ; he was therefore recalled ; and the whole of the party being arranged in the two boats , we shoved off ; the third boat , in which the provender had been stowed , followed us , and was occupied by the two attendants , a call-boy and scene-shifter , who were addressed by Tinfoil as Caliban and Stephano .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 8]: `` Is all our company here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 27]: said a pert-looking , little pug-nosed man , who had taken upon himself the part of Quince the carpenter , in the Midsummer Night 's Dream .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 21]: `` You , Nick Bottom , '' continued he , addressing another , `` are set down for Pyramus . ''
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 15]: The party addressed did not , however , appear to enter into the humour .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 27]: He was a heavy-made , rather corpulent , white-faced personage , dressed in white jean trousers , white waistcoat , brown coat , and white hat .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 31]: Whether anything had put him out of humour I know not , but it is evident that he was the butt of the ladies and of most of the party .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 37]: `` I 'll just thank you , '' replied this personage , whose real name was Winterbottom , `` to be quiet , Mr Western , for I sha n't stand any of your nonsense . ''
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 20]: `` Oh , Mr Winterbottom , surely you are not about to sow the seeds of discord so early .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 26]: Look at the scene before you -- hear how the birds are singing , how merrily the sun shines and how beautifully the water sparkles !
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 12]: Who can be cross on such a morning as this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 29]: `` No , miss , '' replied Mr Winterbottom , `` not at all -- not at all -- only my name 's Winterbottom , and not Bottom .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 16]: I do n't wear an ass 's head to please anybody -- that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 15]: I wo n't be _ bottom _ -- that 's _ flat _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 12]: `` That depends upon circumstances , sir , '' observed Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 15]: `` What business have you to shove your oar in , Mr Waterman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 25]: `` I was hired for the purpose , '' replied Tom , dipping his oar in the water , and giving a hearty stroke .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 23]: `` Stick to your own element , then -- shove your oar into the water , but not into our discourse . ''
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 20]: `` Well , sir , I wo n't say another word , if you do n't like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 19]: `` But you may to me , '' said Titania , laughing , `` whenever you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 18]: `` And to me too , '' said Tinfoil , who was amused with Tom 's replies .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 42]: Mr Winterbottom became very wroth , and demanded to be put on shore directly , but the Fairy Queen ordered us to obey him at our peril , and Mr Winterbottom was carried up the river very much against his inclination .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 40]: `` Our friend is not himself , '' said Mr Tinfoil , producing a key bugle ; `` but -- `` Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast , To soften rocks , and rend the knotted oak .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 17]: `` And , therefore , will we try the effect of it upon his senses . ''
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 24]: Mr Tinfoil then played the air in `` Midas '' : -- `` Pray , Goody , please to moderate , '' etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 10]: During which Mr Winterbottom looked more sulky than ever .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 36]: As soon as the air was finished , another of the party responded with his flute , from the other boat -- while Mr Quince played what he called base , by snapping his fingers .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 53]: The sounds of the instruments floated along the flowing and smooth water , reaching the ears and attracting the attention of many who , for a time , rested from their labour , or hung listlessly over the gunnels of the vessels , watching the boats , and listening to the harmony .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 79]: All was mirth and gaiety -- the wherries kept close to each other , and between the airs the parties kept up a lively and witty conversation , occasionally venting their admiration upon the verdure of the sloping lawns and feathering trees with which the banks of the noble river are so beautifully adorned ; even Mr Winterbottom had partially recovered his serenity , when he was again irritated by a remark of Quince , who addressed him .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 45]: `` You can play no part but Pyramus ; for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man -- a proper man as one shall see on a summer 's day ; a most lovely , gentleman-like man ; therefore , you must needs play Pyramus . ''
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 20]: `` Take care I do n't play the devil with your physiognomy , Mr Western , '' retorted Winterbottom .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 36]: Here Caliban , in the third boat , began playing the fiddle and singing to it -- `` Gaffer , Gaffer 's son , and his little jackass , Were trotting along the road . ''
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 12]: The chorus of which ditty was `` Ee-aw , Ee-aw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 7]: like the braying of a jackass .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 21]: `` Bless thee , Bottom , bless thee ; thou art translated , '' cried Quince , looking at Winterbottom .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 10]: `` Very well -- very well , Mr Western .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 30]: I do n't want to upset the wherry , and therefore you 're safe at present , but the reckoning will come -- so I give you warning . ''
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 10]: `` Slaves of my lamp , do my bidding .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 7]: I will have no quarrelling here .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 39]: You , Quince , shut your mouth ; you , Winterbottom , draw in your lips , and I , your queen , will charm you with a song , '' said Titania , waving her little hand .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 17]: The fiddler ceased playing , and the voice of the fair actress rivetted all our attention .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 39]: `` Wilt thou waken , bride of May , While flowers are fresh , and sweet bells chime , Listen and learn from my roundelay How all life 's pilot boats sailed one day A match with Time !
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 42]: `` Love sat on a lotus-leaf aloft , And saw old Time in his loaded boat , Slowly he crossed Life 's narrow tide , While Love sat clapping his wings , and cried , ` Who will pass Time ? '
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 46]: `` Patience came first , but soon was gone , With helm and sail to help Time on ; Care and Grief could not lend an oar , And Prudence said -LRB- while he staid on shore -RRB- , ` I wait for Time . '
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 45]: `` Hope filled with flowers her cork-tree bark , And lighted its helm with a glow-worm 's spark ; Then Love , when he saw his bark fly past , Said , ` Lingering Time will soon be passed , Hope outspeeds time . '
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 43]: `` Wit went nearest Old Time to pass , With his diamond oar and boat of glass A feathery dart from his store he drew , And shouted , while far and swift it flew , ` O Mirth kills Time ! '
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 43]: `` But Time sent the feathery arrow back , Hope 's boat of Amaranthus miss 'd its track ; Then Love bade its butterfly pilots move , And laughing , said ` They shall see how Love Can conquer Time . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 16]: I need hardly say that the song was rapturously applauded , and most deservedly so .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 29]: Several others were demanded from the ladies and gentlemen of the party , and given without hesitation ; but I can not now recall them to my memory .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 15]: The bugle and flute played between whiles , and all was laughter and merriment .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 38]: `` There 's a sweet place , '' said Tinfoil , pointing to a villa on the Thames ; `` Now , with the fair Titania and ten thousand a-year , one could there live happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 63]: `` I 'm afraid the fair Titania must go to market without the latter encumbrance , '' replied the lady ; `` The gentleman must find the ten thousand a-year , and I must bring as my dowry -- '' `` Ten thousand charms , '' interrupted Tinfoil -- `` that 's most true , and pity 't is 't is true .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 11]: Did your fairyship ever hear my epigram on the subject ?
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 40]: `` Let the lads of the East love the maids of _ Cash-meer _ , Nor affection with interests clash ; Far other idolatry pleases us here , We adore but the maids of _ Mere Cash _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 6]: `` Excellent , good Puck !
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 6]: Have you any more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 22]: `` Not of my own , but you have heard what Winterbottom wrote under the bust of Shakespeare last Jubilee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 12]: `` I knew not that Apollo had ever visited him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 56]: `` You shall hear : -- `` In _ this here _ place the bones of Shakespeare lie , But _ that ere _ form of his shall never die ; A _ speedy end and soon _ this world may have , But Shakespeare 's name shall _ bloom _ beyond the grave . ''
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 24]: `` I 'll trouble you , Mr Tinfoil , not to be so very witty at my expense , '' growled out Winterbottom .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 13]: `` I never wrote a line of poetry in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 21]: `` No one said you did , Winterbottom ; but you wo n't deny that you wrote those lines . ''
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 6]: Mr Winterbottom disdained a reply .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 35]: Gaily did we pass the variegated banks of the river , swept up with a strong flood-tide , and at last arrived at a little island agreed upon as the site of the pic-nic .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 31]: The company disembarked , and were busy looking for a convenient spot for their entertainment , Quince making a rapid escape from Winterbottom , the latter remaining on the bank .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 21]: `` Jenkins , '' said he to the man christened Caliban , `` you did not forget the salad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 10]: `` No , sir , I brought it myself .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 11]: It 's on the top of the little hamper . ''
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 25]: Mr Winterbottom , who , it appears , was extremely partial to salad , was satisfied with the reply , and walked slowly away .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 29]: `` Well , '' said Tom to me , wiping the perspiration from his brow with his handkerchief , `` I would n't have missed this for anything .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 8]: I only wish father had been here .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 13]: I hope that young lady will sing again before we part . ''
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 37]: `` I think it very likely , and that the fun is only begun , '' replied I. `` But come , let 's lend a hand to get the prog out of the boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 3]: `` Pat !
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 2]: pat !
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 11]: and here 's a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 19]: This green plot shall be our stage , '' cried Quince , addressing the others of the party .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 14]: The locality was approved of , and now all were busy in preparation .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 24]: The hampers were unpacked , and cold meats , poultry , pies of various kinds , pastry , etcetera , appeared in abundance .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 29]: `` This is no manager 's feast , '' said Tinfoil ; `` the fowls are not made of wood , nor is small beer substituted for wine .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 14]: Don Juan 's banquet to the Commendador is a farce to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 22]: `` All the manager 's stage banquets are farces , and very sorry jokes into the bargain , '' replied another .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 13]: `` I wish old Morris had to eat his own suppers . ''
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 22]: `` He must get a new set of teeth , or they 'll prove a _ deal _ too tough . ''
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 3]: `` Hiss !
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 4]: turn him out !
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 9]: he 's made a _ pun _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 24]: The hampers were now empty ; some laid the cloth upon the grass , and arranged the plates , and knives and forks .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 22]: The ladies were as busy as the gentlemen -- some were wiping the glasses , others putting salt into the salt-cellars .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 6]: Titania was preparing the salad .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 28]: Mr Winterbottom , who was doing nothing , accosted her ; `` May I beg as a favour that you do not cut the salad too small ?
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 8]: It loses much of its crispness . ''
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 9]: `` Why , what a Nebuchadnezzar you are !
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 10]: However , sir , you shall be obeyed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 7]: `` Who can fry fish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 3]: cried Tinfoil .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 11]: `` Here are two pairs of soles and some eels .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 5]: Where 's Caliban ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 24]: `` Here I am , sir , '' replied the man on his knees , blowing up a fire which he had kindled .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 10]: `` I have got the soup to mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 6]: `` Where 's Stephano ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 8]: `` Cooling the wine , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 13]: `` Who , then , can fry fish , I ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 17]: `` I can , sir , '' replied Tom ; `` but not without butter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 12]: `` Butter shalt thou have , thou disturber of the element .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 9]: Have we not _ Hiren _ here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 32]: `` I was n't _ hired _ as a cook , at all events , '' replied Tom : `` but I 'm rather a _ dab _ at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 15]: `` Then shalt thou have the _ place _ , '' replied the actor .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 29]: `` With all my heart and _ soul _ , '' cried Tom , taking out his knife , and commencing the necessary operation of skinning the fish .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 29]: In half-an-hour all was ready : the fair Titania did me the honour to seat herself upon my jacket , to ward off any damp from the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 78]: The other ladies had also taken their respective seats , as allotted by the mistress of the revels ; the tables were covered by many of the good things of this life ; the soup was ready in a tureen at one end , and Tom had just placed the fish on the table , while Mr Quince and Winterbottom , by the commands of Titania , were despatched for the wine and other varieties of potations .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 44]: When they returned , eyeing one another askance , Winterbottom looking daggers at his opponent , and Quince not quite easy even under the protection of Titania , Tom had just removed the frying-pan from the fire with its residuary grease still bubbling .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 53]: Quince having deposited his load , was about to sit down , when a freak came into Tom 's head , which , however , he dared not put into execution himself ; but `` a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse , '' says the proverb .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 13]: Winterbottom stood before Tom , and Quince with his back to them .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 20]: Tom looked at Winterbottom , pointing slily to the frying-pan , and then to the hinder parts of Quince .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 12]: Winterbottom snatched the hint and the frying-pan at the same moment .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 57]: Quince squatted himself down with a serge , as they say at sea , quoting at the time -- `` Marry , our play is the most lamentable comedy '' -- but putting his hands behind him , to soften his fall , they were received into the hot frying-pan , inserted behind him by Winterbottom .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 5]: `` Oh , Lord !
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 2]: oh !
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 3]: oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 27]: shrieked Mr Quince , springing up like lightning , bounding in the air with the pain , his hands behind him still adhering to the frying-pan .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 52]: At the first scream of Mr Quince , the whole party had been terrified ; the idea was that a snake had bitten him , and the greatest alarm prevailed ; but when they perceived the cause of the disaster , even his expressions of pain could not prevent their mirth .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 5]: It was too ludicrous .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 19]: Still the gentlemen and ladies condoled with him , but Mr Quince was not to be reasoned with .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 30]: He walked away to the river-side , Mr Winterbottom slily enjoying his revenge , for no one but Tom had an idea that it was anything but an accident .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 23]: Mr Quince 's party of pleasure was spoiled , but the others did not think it necessary that theirs should be also .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 18]: A `` really very sorry for poor Western , '' and a half-dozen `` poor fellows ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 24]: intermingled with tittering , was all that his misfortunes called forth after his departure ; and then they set to like French falconers .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 46]: The soup was swallowed , the fish disappeared , joints were cut up , pies delivered up their hidden treasures , fowls were dismembered like rotten boroughs , corks were drawn , others flew without the trouble , and they did eat and were filled .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 50]: Mr Winterbottom kept his eye upon the salad , his favourite condiment , mixed it himself , offered it to all , and was glad to find that no one would spare time to eat it ; but Mr Winterbottom could eat for everybody , and he did eat .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 12]: The fragments were cleared away , and handed over to us .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 34]: We were very busy , doing as ample justice to them as the party had done before us , when Mr Winterbottom was observed to turn very pale , and appeared very uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 4]: inquired Mr Tinfoil .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 21]: `` I 'm -- I 'm not very well -- I -- I 'm afraid something has disagreed with me .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 23]: I 'm very ill , '' exclaimed Mr Winterbottom , turning as white as a sheet , and screwing up his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 30]: `` It must be the salad , '' said one of the ladies ; `` no one has eaten it but yourself , and we are all well . ''
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 26]: `` I -- rather think -- it must be -- oh -- I do recollect that I thought the oil had a queer taste . ''
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 14]: `` Why there was no oil in the castors , '' replied Tinfoil .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 9]: `` I desired Jenkins to get some . ''
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 11]: `` So did I , particularly , '' replied Winterbottom .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 10]: -- oh , dear -- oh , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 18]: `` Jenkins , '' cried Tinfoil , `` where did you get the oil for the castors ?
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 6]: What oil did you get ?
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 9]: -- are you sure it was right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 12]: `` Yes , sir , quite sure , '' replied Jenkins .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 19]: `` I brought it here in a bottle , and put it into the castors before dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 8]: `` Where did you buy it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 8]: `` At the chemist 's , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 24]: Here 's the bottle ; '' and Jenkins produced a bottle with _ castor _ oil in large letters labelled on the side .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 5]: The murder was out .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 16]: Mr Winterbottom groaned , rose from his seat , for he felt very sick indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 28]: The misfortunes of individuals generally add to the general quota of mirth , and Mr Winterbottom 's misfortune had the same effect as that of Mr Quince .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 10]: But where was poor Mr Quince all this time ?
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 34]: He had sent for the iron kettle in which the soup had been warmed up , and filling it full of Thames water , had immersed the afflicted parts in the cooling element .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 32]: There he sat with his hands plunged deep , when Mr Winterbottom made his appearance at the same spot and Mr Quince was comforted by witnessing the state of his enemy .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 25]: Indeed , the sight of Winterbottom 's distress did more to soothe Mr Quince 's pain than all the Thames water in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 39]: He rose , and leaving Winterbottom , with his two hands to his head , leaning against a tree , joined the party , and pledged the ladies in succession , till he was more than half tipsy .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 22]: In the space of half-an-hour Mr Winterbottom returned , trembling and shivering as if he had been suffering under an ague .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 56]: A bumper or two of brandy restored him , and before the day closed in , both Winterbottom and Quince , one applying stimulants to his stomach , and the other drowning his sense of pain in repeated libations , were in a state -LRB- to say the least of it -RRB- of incipient intoxication .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 16]: But there is a time for all things , and it was time to return .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 11]: The evening had passed freely ; song had followed song .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 51]: Tinfoil had tried his bugle , and played not a little out of tune ; the flute also neglected the flats and sharps as of no consequence ; the ladies thought the gentlemen rather too forward , and , in short , it was time to break up the party .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 13]: The hampers were repacked , and handed half-empty , into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 36]: Of wine there was a little left ; and by the direction of Titania , the plates , dishes , etcetera , only were to be returned , and the fragments divided among the boatmen .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 16]: The company re-embarked in high spirits , and we had the ebb-tide to return with .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 26]: Just as we were shoving off , it was remembered that the ice-pail had been left under the tree , besides a basket with sundries .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 63]: The other wherries had shoved off , and they were in consequence brought into our boat , in which we had the same company as before , with the exception of Mr Western , _ alias _ Quince , who preferred the boat which carried the hampers , that he might loll over the side , with his hands in the water .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 20]: Mr Winterbottom soon showed the effects of the remedy he had taken against the effects of the castor oil .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 32]: He was uproarious , and it was with difficulty that he could be persuaded to sit still in the boat , much to the alarm of Titania and the other ladies .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 37]: He would make violent love to the fairy queen ; and as he constantly shifted his position to address her and throw himself at her feet , there was some danger of the boat being upset .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 32]: At last Tom proposed to him to sit on the pail before her , as then he could address her with safety ; and Winterbottom staggered up to take the seat .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 32]: As he was seating himself , Tom took off the cover , so that he was plunged into the half-liquid ice ; but Mr Winterbottom was too drunk to perceive it .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 33]: He continued to rant and to rave , and protest and vow , and even spout for some time , when suddenly the quantity of caloric extracted from him produced its effect .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 26]: `` I -- I -- really believe that the night is damp -- the dew falls -- the seat is damp , fair Titania . ''
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 19]: `` It 's only fancy , Mr Winterbottom , '' replied Titania who was delighted with his situation .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 35]: `` Jean trousers are cool in the evening ; it 's only an excuse to get away from me , and I never will speak again to you if you quit your seat . ''
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 31]: `` The fair Titania , the mistress of my soul , and body too , if she pleases -- has -- but to command -- and her slave obeys . ''
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 46]: `` I rather think it is a little damp , '' said Tinfoil ; `` allow me to throw a little sand upon your seat ; '' and Tinfoil pulled out a large paper bag full of salt , which he strewed over the ice .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 41]: Winterbottom was satisfied , and remained ; but by the time we had reached Vauxhall Bridge , the refrigeration had become so complete that he was fixed on the ice , which the application of the salt had made solid .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 52]: He complained of cold , shivered , attempted to rise , but could not extricate himself ; at last his teeth chattered , and he became almost sober ; but he was helpless from the effects of the castor oil , his intermediate intoxication , and his present state of numbness .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 27]: He spoke less and less ; at last he was silent , and when we arrived at Whitehall stairs he was firmly fixed in the ice .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 16]: When released he could not walk , and he was sent home in a hackney-coach .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 16]: `` It was cruel to punish him so , Mr Tinfoil , '' said Titania .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 4]: `` Cruel punishment !
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 20]: Why , yes ; a sort of _ impailment _ , '' replied Mr Tinfoil , offering his arm .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 49]: The remainder of the party landed and walked home , followed by the two assistants , who took charge of the crockery ; and thus ended the pic-nic party , which , as Tom said , was the very funniest day he had ever spent in his life .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY NINE .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 64]: MR. TURNBULL `` SETS HIS HOUSE IN ORDER '' -- MRS. T THINKS SUCH CONDUCT VERY DISORDERLY -- THE CAPTAIN AT HIS OLD TRICKS WITH HIS HARPOON -- HE PAYS HIS LADY 'S DEBTS OF HONOUR , AND GIVES THE APPLICANT A QUITTANCE UNDER HIS OWN FOOT -- MONSIEUR AND MADAME TAGLIABUE WITHDRAW FROM THE SOCIETY OF `` CES BARBARES LES ANGLAIS . ''
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 52]: It was on the Sunday after the picnic party , when , feeling I had neglected Captain Turnbull , and that he would think it unkind of me not to go near him , after having accompanied Mary to church , I set off on foot to his villa near Brentford .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 16]: I rang at the porter 's lodge , and asked whether he was at home .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 34]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied the old woman at the lodge , who was very communicative , and very friendly with me ; `` and missus be at home too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 37]: I walked up the carriage-drive of one hundred yards , which led to the entrance-door ; and when I rang it was opened by a servant I had not seen before as belonging to the establishment .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 7]: `` Where is Mr Turnbull ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 38]: inquired I. `` He is in his own room , sir , '' replied the man ; `` but you must send up your name , if you please , as every one is not admitted . ''
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 16]: I must observe to the reader that I was not dressed in jacket and trousers .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 35]: The money I earned was more than sufficient to supply all my expenses , and I had fitted on what are called at sea , and on the river , _ long togs _ .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 10]: I was dressed as most people are on shore .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 25]: The servant evidently took me for a gentleman ; and perhaps , as far as dress went , I was entitled to that distinction .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 16]: Many people are received as such in this world with less claims than I had .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 24]: I gave my name ; the man left me at the door , and soon returned , requesting that I would follow him .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 37]: I must say that I was rather astonished ; where were Mr Mortimer and the two men in flaunting liveries , and long cotton epaulettes with things like little marline-spikes hanging to the ends of them ?
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 19]: Even the livery was changed , being a plain brown coat , with light blue collar and cuffs .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 114]: I was , however , soon made acquainted with what had taken place on my entering the apartment of Mr Turnbull -- his study , as Mrs T called it , although Mr Turnbull insisted upon calling it his cabin , a name certainly more appropriate , as it contained but two small shelves of books , the remainder of the space being filled up with favourite harpoons , porpoise skulls , sharks ' jaws , corals , several bears ' skins , brown and white , and one or two models of the vessels which had belonged to his brother and himself , and which had been employed in the Greenland fishery .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 19]: It was , in fact , a sort of museum of all he had collected during his voyages .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 36]: Esquimaux implements , ornaments and dresses , were lying about in corners ; and skins of rare animals , killed by himself , such as black foxes , etcetera , were scattered about the carpet .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 42]: His sea-chest , full of various articles , was also one of the ornaments of the room , much to the annoyance of Mrs T , who had frequently exerted her influence to get rid of it , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 23]: The only articles of furniture were two sofas , a large table in the centre , and three or four heavy chairs .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 70]: The only attempt at adornment consisted in a dozen coloured engravings , framed and glazed , of walrus shooting , etcetera , taken from the folio works of Captains Cook and Mulgrave ; and a sketch or two by his brother , such as the state of the _ William _ pressed by an iceberg on the morning of the 25th of January , latitude -- , longitude -- .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 20]: Captain T was in his morning-gown , evidently not very well , at least he appeared harassed and pale .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 12]: `` My dear Jacob , this is very kind of you .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 25]: I did mean to scold you for not coming before ; but I 'm too glad to see you to find the heart now .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 10]: But why have you kept away so long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 11]: `` I have really been very well employed , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 24]: Stapleton has given me up the wherry , and I could not neglect his interests , even if I did my own . ''
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 14]: `` Always right , boy ; and how are you getting on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 14]: `` I am very happy , sir ; very happy , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 16]: `` I 'm glad to hear it , Jacob ; may you always be so .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 20]: Now , take the other sofa , and let us have a long palaver , as the Indians say .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 7]: I have something to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 10]: I suppose you observed a change -- heh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 15]: `` Yes , sir ; I observed that Mr Mortimer was not visible . ''
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 3]: `` Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 35]: Mr Mortimer , or John Snobbs , the rascal , is at present in Newgate for trial : and I mean to send him out on a voyage for the good of his health .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 27]: I caught the scoundrel at last , and I 'll show him no more mercy than I would to a shark that had taken the bait .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 6]: But that 's not all .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 28]: We have had a regular mutiny and attempt to take the ship from me ; but I have them all in irons , and ordered for punishment .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 15]: Jacob , money is but too often a curse , depend upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 18]: `` You 'll not find many of your opinion , sir , '' replied I , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 55]: `` Perhaps not ; because those who have it are content with the importance which it gives to them , and wo n't allow the damnable fact ; and because those who have it not are always sighing after it , as if it were the only thing worth looking after in this world .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 24]: But now , I will just tell you what has happened since I last saw you , and then you shall judge . ''
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 29]: As , however , Captain T 's narrative ran to a length of nearly three hours , I shall condense the matter for the information of the reader .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 39]: It appeared that Mrs T had continued to increase the lengths of her drives in her carriage , the number of her acquaintances , and her manifold expenses , until Mr T had remonstrated in very strong terms .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 64]: His remonstrances did not , however , meet with the attention which he had expected ; and he found out by accident , moreover , that the money with which he had constantly supplied Mrs T , to defray her weekly bills , had been otherwise appropriated ; and that the bills for the two last quarters had none of them been paid .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 22]: This produced an altercation , and a desire on his part to know in what manner these sums had been disbursed .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 61]: At first the only reply from Mrs T , who considered it advisable to brazen it out , and , if possible , gain the ascendancy which was necessary , was a contemptuous toss of her head , which undulated the three yellow ostrich feathers in her bonnet , as she walked out of the room and entered her carriage .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 32]: This , to Mr T , who was a matter-of-fact man , was not very satisfactory ; he waited perforce until the carriage returned , and then demanded an explicit answer .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 24]: Mrs T assumed the highest ground , talked about fashionable expenses , her knowledge of what was due to his character , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 22]: Mr T rejoined about necessary expenses , and that it was due to his character to pay his tradesmen 's bills .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 58]: Mrs T then talked of good-breeding , best society , and her _ many plaisers _ , as she termed them ; Mr T did not know what _ many pleasures _ meant in French ; but he thought she had been indulged in as many as most women since they had come down to this establishment .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 21]: But to the question : why were not the bills paid , and what had she done with the money ?
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 7]: Spent it in _ pin money .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 4]: Pin _ money !
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 8]: thirty pounds a-week in _ pins _ !
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 13]: it would have bought harpoons enough for a three years ' voyage .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 6]: She must tell the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 20]: She would n't tell anything , but called for her salts , and called him a _ brute _ .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 14]: At all events , he would n't be called a _ fool _ .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 12]: He gave her till the next morning to consider of it .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 19]: The next morning the bills were all sent in as requested , and amounted to six hundred pounds .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 6]: They were paid and receipted .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 25]: `` Now , Mrs T , will you oblige me by letting me know what you have done with this six hundred pounds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 15]: Mrs T would not -- she was not to be treated in that manner .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 18]: Mr T was not on board a whaler now , to bully and frighten as he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 7]: She would have justice done her .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 10]: Have a separation , alimony , and a divorce .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 21]: She might have them all if she pleased , but she should have no more money ; that was certain .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 9]: Then she would have a fit of hysterics .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 23]: So she did , and lay the whole of the day on the sofa , expecting Mr T would pick her up .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 11]: But the idea never came into Mr T 's head .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 50]: He went to bed ; and feeling restless , he rose very early , and saw from his window a cart drive up to the wall , and the parties who came with it leap over and enter the house , and return carrying to it two large hampers .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 56]: He snatched up one of his harpoons , walked out the other way , and arrived at the cart just as the hampers had been put in , and they were about to drive off ; challenged them , and instead of being answered , the horse was flogged , and he nearly run over .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 44]: He then let fly his harpoon into the horse , which dropped , and pitched out the two men on their heads insensible ; secured them , called to the lodge for assistance , sent for constables , and gave them in charge .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 23]: They proved to be hampers forwarded by Mr Mortimer , who had been in the habit of so doing for some time .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 24]: These hampers contained his best wine , and various other articles , which also proved that Mr Mortimer must have had false keys .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 69]: Leaving the culprits and property in charge of two constables , Mr T returned to the house in company with the third constable ; the door was opened by Mr Mortimer , who followed him into his study , told him he should leave the house directly , had always lived with _ gentlemen _ before , and requested that he might have what was due to him .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 18]: Mr T thought the request but reasonable , and therefore gave him in charge of the constable .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 22]: Mr Snobbs , rather confounded at such ungentlemanly behaviour , was , with the others , marched off to Bow Street .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 40]: Mr T sends for the other two servants in livery , and assures them that he has no longer any occasion for their services , having the excessive vulgar idea that this peculation must have been known to them .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 18]: Pays them their wages , requests they will take off their liveries , and leave the house .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 3]: Both willing .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 13]: _ They _ also had always lived with _ gentlemen _ before .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 33]: Mr T takes the key of the butler 's pantry , that the plate may not consider him too vulgar to remain in the house , and then walks to the stables .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 20]: Horses neigh , as if to say they are all ready for their breakfasts ; but the door locked .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 7]: Hails the coachman , no answer .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 35]: Returning from the stables , perceives coachee , rather dusty , coming in at the lodge gate ; requests to know why he did not sleep at home and take care of his horses .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 40]: He was missus 's coachman , not master 's , and could satisfy her , but could not satisfy Mr T ; who paid him his wages 's and , deducting his liveries , sent him after the others .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 17]: Coachee also was very glad to go -- had always lived with _ gentlemen _ before .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 21]: Meets the lady 's maid , who tells him Mrs T is much too ill to come down to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 12]: Rather fortunate , as there was no breakfast to be had .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 40]: Dresses himself , gets into a pair-horse coach , arrives at the White Horse Cellar , swallows his breakfast , goes to Bow Street , commits Mr Mortimer , _ alias _ Snobbs , and his confederates for trial .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 20]: Hires a job-man to bring the horses up for sale , and leaves his carriage at the coachmaker 's .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 14]: Obtains a temporary footman , and then Mr T returns to his villa .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 7]: A very good morning 's work .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 38]: Finds Mrs T up in the parlour , very much surprised and shocked at his conduct -- at no Mr Mortimer -- at no servants , and indebted to her own maid for a cup of tea .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 22]: More recriminations -- more violence -- another threat of alimony , and the carriage ordered , that she may seek counsel .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 17]: No coachman -- no carriage -- no horses -- no nothing , as her maid declares .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 24]: Mrs T locks herself up in her room , and another day is passed with as little matrimonial comfort as can be expected .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 11]: In the meantime , the news flies in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 6]: Brentford is full of it .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 35]: Mr T had been living too fast -- is done up -- had been had up at Bow Street -- creditors had poured in with bills -- servants discharged -- carriage and horses seized .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 21]: Mrs T , poor creature , in hysterics , and nobody surprised at it ; indeed , everybody expected it .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 22]: The Peters of Petercumb Hall heard it , and shook their heads at the many upstarts there were in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 97]: Mr Smith requested the Right Honourable Lord Viscount Babbleton never to mention to his father the Right Honourable Marquis of Spring-guns , that he had ever been taken to see the Turnbulls or that he , Mr Smith , would infallibly lose his situation in _ esse _ , and his living in _ posse _ : and Monsieur and Madame Tagliabue were even more astounded ; but they felt deeply , and resolved to pay a visit the next morning , at least Monsieur Tagliabue did , and Madame acknowledged to the propriety of it .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 32]: The next morning some little order had been restored ; the footman hired had been given in charge of a sufficient quantity of plate , the rest had been locked up .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 90]: The cook was to stay her month ; the housemaid had no wish to leave ; and as for the lady 's maid , she would remain as long as she could to console her poor mistress , and accept what she was inclined to give her in return , in any way of clothes , dresses , etcetera , although , of course , she could not hurt her character by remaining too long in a family where there was no carriage , or gentlemen out of livery .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 22]: Still Mr T did obtain some breakfast , and had just finished when Monsieur Tagliabue was announced , and was received .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 9]: Monsieur T , I hope madame is better .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 25]: Madame Tagliabue did nothing but cry all last night when she heard the very bad news about de debt , and all dat . ''
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 27]: `` Very much obliged to Madame , '' replied Turnbull , gruffly ; `` and now , pray sir , what may be your pleasure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 27]: Monsieur Turnbull , I feel very much for you ; but suppose a gentleman no lose his _ honour _ , what matter de money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 6]: -LRB- Mr Turnbull stared . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 14]: `` You see , Monsieur Turnbull , honour be everything to a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 29]: If a gentleman owe money to one rascally tradesfellow , and not pay him , dat no great matter ; but he always pay de debt of honour .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 5]: Every gentleman pay dat .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 55]: Here , Monsieur Turnbull , '' -LRB- and the little Frenchman pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket -RRB- , `` be a leetle note of Madame Turnbull , which she gave to Madame Tagliabue , in which she acknowledged she owe two hundred pounds for money lost at _ ecarte _ .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 37]: Dat you see , Monsieur Turnbull , be what gentlemen call debt of honour , which every gentleman pay , or else he lose de character , and be called one blackguard by all the world .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 61]: Madame Tagliabue and I too much fond of you and Madame Turnbull not to save your character , and so I come by her wish to beg you to settle this leetle note -- this _ leetle _ debt of _ honour _ ; '' and Monsieur Tagliabue laid the note on the table , with a very polite bow .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 14]: Mr Turnbull examined the note ; it was as described by Monsieur Tagliabue .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 26]: So , thought he , now the whole story 's out ; she has been swindled out of her money by this rascally French couple .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 38]: `` Now , Monsieur Tagliabue , '' said he , `` allow me to put a question or two before I pay this money ; and if you answer me sincerely , I shall raise no objection .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 18]: I think Mrs T has already lost about six hundred pounds at _ ecarte _ before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 23]: -LRB- Monsieur T , who presumed that Mrs Turnbull had made him acquainted with the fact , answered in the affirmative . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 18]: `` And I think that two months ago she never knew what _ ecarte _ was . ''
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 15]: `` Dat is true ; but the ladies are very quick to learn . ''
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 46]: `` Well , but now , do you think that , as she knew nothing about the game , and you and your wife are well acquainted with it , it was honourable on your part to allow her to lose so much money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 20]: Monsieur , when a lady say she will play _ comment faire _ , what can you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 14]: `` But why did you never play at this house , Monsieur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 17]: Monsieur Turnbull , it is for de lady of de house to propose de game . ''
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 62]: `` Very true , '' replied Mr Turnbull , writing a cheque for the two hundred pounds ; `` there is your money , Mr Tagliabue ; and now that you are paid , allow me to observe that I consider you and your wife a couple of swindlers ; and beg that you will never enter my doors again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 7]: `` Vat you say , sir !
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 4]: _ Swind-lare _ !
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 3]: God dam !
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 8]: Sar , I will have satisfaction . ''
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 19]: `` You 've got your money -- is that sufficient , or do you want anything else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 9]: replied Mr T , rising from his chair .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 16]: `` Yes , sar , I do want more -- I will have more . ''
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 29]: `` So you shall , then , '' replied Mr Turnbull , kicking him out of the room along the passage , and out of the front door .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 28]: Monsieur Tagliabue turned round every now and then , and threatened , and then tried to escape , as he perceived the upraised boot of Mr Turnbull .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 27]: When fairly out of the house he turned round , `` Monsieur Turnbull , I will have de satisfaction , de terrible satisfaction , for this .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 4]: You shall pay .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 15]: By God , sar , you shall pay -- de money for this . ''
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 19]: That evening Mr Turnbull was summoned to appear at Bow Street on the following morning for the assault .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 35]: He met Monsieur Tagliabue with his lawyer , and acknowledged that he had kicked him out of his house for swindling his wife , refused all accommodation , and was prepared with his bail .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 31]: Monsieur Tagliabue stormed and blustered , talked about his acquaintance with the nobility ; but the magistrate had seen too much of foreigners to place much reliance on their asseverations .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 8]: `` Who are you , monsieur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 9]: `` Sar , I am a gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 10]: `` What profession are you of , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 10]: `` Sar , a gentleman has no profession . ''
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 11]: `` But how do you live , Monsieur Tagliabue ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 10]: `` As a gentleman always does , sar . ''
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 16]: `` You mentioned Lord Scrope just now as your particular friend , I think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 34]: `` Yes , sar , me very intimate with Lord Scrope ; me spend three months at Scrope Castle with mi Lady Scrope ; mi Lady Scrope very fond of Madame Tagliabue . ''
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 20]: `` Very well , Monsieur Tagliabue ; we must proceed with another case until Mr Turnbull 's bail arrives .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 12]: Sit down for a little while , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 48]: Another case was then heard , which lasted about half-an-hour ; but previous to hearing it , the magistrate , who knew that Lord Scrope was in town , had despatched a runner with a note to his lordship , and the answer was now brought back .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 41]: The magistrate read it , and smiled ; went on with the other case , and when it was finished , said , `` Now , M. Tagliabue , you have said that you were intimate with Lord Scrope . ''
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 9]: `` Yes , sar , very intimate . ''
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 32]: `` Well , Lord Scrope I have the pleasure of knowing : and , as he is in town , I wrote a note to him and here is his answer .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 6]: I will read it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 32]: M. Tagliabue turned pale as the magistrate read the following : -- `` DEAR SIR -- A fellow of the name you mention came from Russia with me as my valet .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 63]: I discharged him with dishonesty ; after he left , Lady Scrope 's attendant , who it appeared was , unknown to us , married to him , left also , and then I discovered the peculations to have been so extensive that had we known where to have laid hold of him , I should certainly have brought them before you .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 19]: Now the affair is forgotten ; but a greater scoundrel never existed ; -- Yours , SCROPE . ''
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 14]: `` Now , sir , what have you to say for yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 8]: continued the magistrate in a severe tone .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 35]: M. Tagliabue fell on his knees and begged for mercy from the magistrate , from Lord Scrope , and lastly , from Mr Turnbull , to whom he proffered the draft for 200 pounds .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 54]: The magistrate , seeing that Mr Turnbull did not take it , said to him , `` Make no ceremony of taking your money back again , Mr Turnbull ; the very offer of it proves that he has gained it dishonestly ; and 600 pounds is quite enough to have lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 54]: Mr Turnbull then took the cheque and tore it in pieces , and the magistrate ordered M. Tagliabue to be taken to the alien office , and he was sent to the other side of the Channel , in company with his wife , to play _ ecarte _ with whomsoever he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 8]: Thus ended the episode of Monsieur Tagliabue .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTY .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 73]: MR. TURNBULL FINDS OUT THAT MONEY , THOUGH A NECESSARY EVIL , IS NOT A SOURCE OF HAPPINESS -- THE DOMINIE FINDS OUT THAT A LITTLE CALUMNY IS MORE EFFECTUAL THAN OVID 'S REMEDY FOR LOVE ; AND I FIND OUT THAT WALKING GIVES ONE A GOOD APPETITE FOR FILLET OF VEAL AND BACON -- I SET AN EXAMPLE TO THE CLERGY IN REFUSING TO TAKE MONEY FOR A SEAT IN CHURCH .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 29]: `` And now you see , Jacob , what a revolution has taken place ; not very pleasant , I grant , but still it was very necessary .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 52]: I have since been paying all my bills , for the report of my being in difficulty has brought them in fast enough ; and I find that in these last five months my wife has spent a whole year 's income ; so it was quite time to stop . ''
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 24]: `` I agree with you , sir ; but what does Mrs Turnbull say now -- has she come to her senses ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 17]: `` Pretty well , I expect , although she does not quite choose to acknowledge it .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 26]: I have told her that she must dispense with a carriage in future ; and so she shall , till I think she deserves it .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 20]: She knows that she must either have _ my company _ in the house , or none at all .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 56]: She knows that the Peters of Petercumb Hall have cut her , for they did not answer a note of hers , sent by the gardener ; and Mr Smith has written a very violent answer to another of her notes , wondering at her attempting to push herself into the company of the aristocracy .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 18]: But what has brought her to her senses more than all is the affair of Monsieur Tagliabue .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 48]: The magistrate , at my request , gave me the note of Lord Scrope , and I have taken good care that she could read the police report as well ; but the fact is , she is so much mortified that I say nothing to her .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 27]: She has been following the advice of these French swindlers , who have led her wrong , to be able to cheat her of her money .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 29]: I expect she will ask me to sell this place , and go elsewhere ; but at present we hardly exchange a word during the whole day . ''
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 24]: `` I feel very sorry for her , sir ; for I really believe her to be a very good kind-hearted person . ''
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 13]: `` That 's like you , Jacob -- and so she is .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 11]: At present she is in a state to be pitied .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 23]: She would throw a share of the blame upon other people , and can not -- she feels it is all herself .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 55]: All her bubbles of grandeur have burst , and she finds herself not half so respectable as she was before her vanity induced her to cut her former acquaintance , and try to get into the society of those who laughed at her , and at the same time were not half so creditable .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 21]: But it 's that cursed money which has proved her unhappiness -- and , I may add , mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 22]: `` Well , sir , I see no chance of its ever adding to my misfortunes , at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 31]: `` Perhaps not , Jacob , even if you ever should get any ; but , at all events , you may take a little to-morrow , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 48]: I can not ask you to dine here ; it would not be pleasant to you , and show a want of feeling to my wife ; but I should like you to come up with the wherry to-morrow , and we 'll take a cruise . ''
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 16]: `` Very well , I shall be at your orders -- at what time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 17]: `` Say ten o'clock if the weather is fine ; if not the next day . ''
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 22]: `` Then , sir , I 'll now wish you good-bye , as I must go and see the Dominie . ''
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 10]: Mr Turnbull took my hand , and we parted .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 38]: I was soon at Brentford , and was continuing my course through the long , main street , when I met Mr and Mrs Tomkins , the former head clerk who had charge of the Brentford Wharf .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 23]: `` I was intending to call upon you , sir , after I had paid a visit to my old master . ''
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 28]: `` Very well , Jacob ; and recollect we dine at half-past three -- fillet of veal and bacon -- do n't be late for dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 19]: I promised that I would not , and in a few minutes more arrived at the Grammar School .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 27]: I looked at its peaked , antiquated front , and called to mind my feelings when , years back , I had first entered its porch .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 44]: What a difference between the little uncouth , ignorant , savage , tricked out like a harlequin , and now the tall , athletic , well-dressed youth , happy in his independence , and conscious , although not vain , of his acquirements !
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 7]: and I mentally blessed the founders .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 33]: But I had to talk to the Dominie , and to keep my appointment with the veal and bacon at half-past three , so I could not spare any time for meditation .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 27]: I , therefore , unfolded my arms , and making use of my legs , entered the wicket , and proceeded to the Dominie 's room .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 12]: The door was ajar , and I entered without being perceived .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 23]: I have often been reminded , by Flemish paintings which I have seen since , of the picture which then presented itself .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 9]: The room was not large , but lofty .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 28]: It had but one window , fitted with small diamond-shaped panes in heavy wood-work , through which poured a broad , but subdued , stream of light .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 27]: On one side of the window was an ancient armoire , containing the Dominie 's library , not gilt and lettered but well thumbed and worn .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 15]: On the other his huge chest of drawers , on which lay , alas !
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 17]: for the benefit of the rising generations , a new birch rod , of large dimensions .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 42]: The table was in the centre of the room , and the Dominie sat at it , with his back to the window , in a dressing-gown , once black , having been a cassock , but now brown with age .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 48]: He was on his high and narrow-backed chair , leaning forwards , with both elbows on the table , his spectacles on his luxuriant nose , and his hands nearly meeting on the top of his bald crown , earnestly poring over the contents of a book .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 35]: A large Bible , which he constantly made use of , was also on the table , and had apparently been shoved from him to give place to the present object of his meditations .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 19]: His pipe lay on the floor in two pieces , having been thrown off without his perceiving it .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 20]: On one side of him was a sheet of paper , on which he evidently had been writing extracts .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 22]: I passed by him without his perceiving me , and gaining the back of his chair , looked over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 16]: The work he was so intent upon was `` Ovid 's Remedy of Love . ''
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 36]: It appeared that he had nearly finished reading through the whole , for in less than a minute he closed the book , and laying his spectacles down , threw himself back in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 35]: `` Strange , '' soliloquised the Dominie ; `` Yet , verily , is some of his advice important , and I should imagine commendable , yet I do not find my remedy therein .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 80]: ` _ Avoid idleness _ ' -- yes , that is sage counsel -- and employment to one that hath not employed himself may drive away thought ; but I have never been idle , and mine hath not been love in idleness ; ` _ Avoid her presence _ ' -- that I must do ; yet doth she still present herself to mine imagination , and I doubt whether the tangible reality could be more clearly perceptible .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 12]: Even now doth she stand before me in all her beauty .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 43]: ` _ Read not Propertius and Tibullus _ ' -- that is easily refrained from ; but read what I will , in a minute the type passeth from my eyes , and I see but her face beaming from the page .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 17]: Nay , cast my eyes in what direction I may wist , it is the same .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 85]: If I looked at the stained wall , the indistinct lines gradually form themselves into her profile ; if I look at the clouds , they will assume some of the redundant outlines of her form ; if I cast mine eyes upon the fire in the kitchen-grate , the coals will glow and cool until I see her face ; nay , but yesterday , the shoulder of mutton upon the spit gyrated until it at last assumed the decapitated head of Mary .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 20]: ` _ Think of her faults and magnify them _ ' -- nay , that were unjust and unchristian .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 7]: Let me rather correct mine own .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 28]: I fear me that when Ovid wrote his picture he intended it for the use of young men , and not for an old fool like me .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 2]: Behold !
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 17]: I have again broken my pipe -- the fourth pipe that I have destroyed this week .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 6]: What will the dame say ?
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 31]: already hath she declared me demented , and God knows she is not very far from the truth ; '' and the Dominie covered up his face in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 35]: I took this opportunity to step to the door , and appear to enter it , dropping the latch , and rousing the Dominie by the noise , who extended to me his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 35]: `` Welcome , my son -- welcome to thine old preceptor ; and to the walls which first received thee , when thou wert cast on shore as a tangle weed from the river .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 13]: Sit , Jacob ; I was thinking of thee and thine . ''
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 5]: `` What , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 11]: of old Stapleton and his daughter , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 19]: `` Even so ; ye were all in my thoughts at the moment that thou madest thy appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 5]: They are well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 45]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied I. `` I see but little of them ; the old man is always smoking , and as for the girl -- why , the less one sees of her the better , I should say . ''
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 18]: `` Nay , Jacob , this is new to me ; yet is she most pleasant . ''
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 32]: I knew the Dominie 's character , and that if anything could cure his unfortunate passion , it would be a supposition on his part that the girl was not correct .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 31]: I determined at all events to depreciate her , as I knew that what I said would never be mentioned by him , and would therefore do her no harm .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 26]: Still , I felt that I had to play a difficult game , as I was determined not to state what was not the fact .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 26]: `` Pleasant , sir ; yes , pleasant to everybody ; the fact is ; I do n't like such girls as she is . ''
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 12]: `` Indeed , Jacob ; what , is she light ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 7]: I smiled and made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 12]: `` Yet I perceived it not , '' replied the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 19]: `` She is just like her mother , '' observed I. `` And what was her mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 23]: I gave a brief account of her mother , and how she met her death in trying to escape from her husband .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 4]: The Dominie mused .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 21]: `` Little skilled am I in women , Jacob , yet what thou sayest not only surpriseth but grieveth me .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 8]: She is fair to look upon . ''
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 9]: `` Handsome is that handsome does , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 15]: She 'll make many a man 's heart ache yet , I expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 5]: `` Indeed , Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 14]: I am full of marvel at what thou hast already told me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 11]: `` I have seen more of her , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 9]: `` I pray thee tell me more . ''
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 10]: `` No , sir , I had rather not .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 8]: You may imagine all you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 18]: `` Still she is young , Jacob ; when she becometh a wife she might alter . ''
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 35]: `` Sir , it is my firm opinion -LRB- and so it was -RRB- , that if you were to marry her to-morrow , she would run away from you in a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 10]: `` Is that thy candid opinion , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 20]: `` I will stake my life upon her so doing , although not as to the exact time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 26]: `` Jacob , I thank thee -- thank thee much ; thou hast opened mine eyes -- thou hast done me more good than Ovid .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 32]: Yes , boy ; even the ancients , whom I have venerated , have not done me so kind an act as thou , a stripling , whom I have fostered .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 63]: Thou hast repaid me , Jacob -- thou hast rewarded me , Jacob -- thou hast protected me , Jacob -- thou hast saved me , Jacob -- hast saved me both from myself and from her ; for know , Jacob -- know -- that mine heart did yearn towards that maiden ; and I thought her even to be perfection .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 6]: Jacob , I thank thee !
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 40]: Now leave me , Jacob , that I may commune with myself , and search out my own heart , for I am awakened -- awakened as from a dream , and I would fain be quite alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 41]: I was not sorry to leave the Dominie , for I also felt that I would fain be in company with the fillet of veal and bacon , so I shook hands , and thus ended my second morning call .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 17]: I was in good time at Mr Tomkins ' , who received me with great kindness .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 54]: He was well pleased with his new situation , which was one of respectability and consequence , independently of profit ; and I met at his table one or two people who , to my knowledge , would have considered it degrading to have visited him when only head clerk to Mr Drummond .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 60]: We talked over old affairs , not forgetting the ball , and the illuminations , and Mr Turnbull 's _ bon mot _ about Paradise ; and after a very pleasant evening ; I took my leave with the intention of walking back to Fulham , but I found old Tom waiting outside , on the look-out for me .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 21]: `` Jacob , my boy , I want you to come down to my old shop one of these days .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 9]: What day will you be able to come ?
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 59]: The lighter will be here for a fortnight at least , I find from Mr Tomkins , as she waits for a cargo coming by canal , and there is no other craft expected above bridge , so tell me what day will you come and see the old woman , and spend the whole day with us .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 21]: I wants to talk a bit with you , and ax your opinion about a good many little things . ''
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 5]: replied I , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 13]: `` What , are you going to build a new house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 37]: `` No , no -- not that ; but you see , Jacob , as I told you last winter , it was time for me to give up night work up and down the river .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 22]: I 'm not so young as I was about fifty years ago , and there 's a time for all things .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 50]: I do mean to give up the craft in the autumn , and go on shore for a _ full due _ ; but , at the same time , I must see how I can make matters out , so tell me what day you will come . ''
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 11]: `` Well , then , shall we say Wednesday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 42]: `` Wednesday 's as good a day as any other day ; come to breakfast , and you shall go away after supper , if you like ; if not , the old woman shall sling a hammock for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 11]: `` Agreed , then ; but where 's Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 21]: `` Tom , I do n't know ; but I think he 's gone after that daughter of Stapleton 's .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 32]: He begins to think of the girls now , Jacob ; but , as the old buffer , her father , says , ` it 's all human natur ' . '
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 21]: Howsomever , I never interferes in these matters : they seem to be pretty well matched , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 7]: `` How do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 47]: `` Why , as for good looks , they be well enough matched , that 's sure ; but I do n't mean that , I mean , he is quite as knowing as she is , and will shift his helm as she shifts hers .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 24]: ` Twill be a long running fight , and when one strikes , t ` other wo n't have much to boast of .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 47]: Perhaps they may sheer off after all -- perhaps they may sail as consorts ; God only knows ; but this I knows , that Tom 's sweetheart may be as tricky as she pleases , but Tom 's wife wo n't be -- 'cause why ?
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 7]: He 'll keep her in order .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 11]: Well , good-night ; I have a long walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 9]: When I returned home I found Mary alone .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 7]: `` Has Tom been here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 11]: inquired I. `` What makes you ask that question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 3]: replied Mary .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 13]: `` To have it answered -- if you have no objection . ''
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 5]: `` Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 20]: Well , then , Mr Jacob , Tom has been here , and very amusing he has been . ''
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 18]: `` So he always is , '' replied I. `` And where may you have been ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 4]: I told her .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 7]: `` So you saw old Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 13]: Now , tell me , what did he say about me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 41]: `` That I shall not tell , '' replied I ; `` but I will tell you this , that he will not think about you any more ; and you must not expect ever to see him again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 8]: `` But recollect that he promised . ''
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 9]: `` He kept his promise , Mary . ''
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 11]: `` Oh , he told you so , did he ?
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 9]: Did he tell you all that passed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 32]: `` No , Mary , he never told me that he had been here , neither did he tell me what had passed ; but I happen to know all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 8]: `` I can not understand that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 35]: `` Still , it is true ; and I think , on the whole , you behaved pretty well , although I can not understand why you gave him a kiss at parting . ''
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 4]: `` Good heaven !
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 4]: where were you ?
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 8]: You must have been in the room .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 9]: And you heard every word that passed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 31]: `` Every word , '' replied I. `` Well , '' said Mary , `` I could not have believed that you could have done so mean a thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 27]: `` Mary , rather accuse your own imprudence ; what I heard was to be heard by everyone in the street as well as by me .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 37]: If you choose to have love scenes in a room not eight feet from the ground , with the window wide open , you must not be surprised at every passer-by hearing what you say . ''
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 7]: `` Well , that 's true .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 31]: I never thought of the window being open ; not that I would have cared if all the world had heard me , if _ you _ had not . ''
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 29]: It never occurred to me till then why Mary was annoyed at my having overheard her , but at once I recollected what she had said about me .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 5]: I made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 16]: Mary sat down , leaned her forehead against her hands , and was also silent .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 10]: I , therefore , took my candle and retired .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 69]: It appeared that Mary 's pride was much mortified at my having heard her confession of being partial to me -- a confession which certainly made very little impression on me , as I considered that she might , a month afterwards , confess the same relative to Tom , or any other individual who took her fancy ; but in this I did not do her justice .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 23]: Her manners were afterwards much changed towards me ; she always appeared to avoid , rather than to seek , further intimacy .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 22]: As for myself , I continued , as before , very good friends , kind towards her , but nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 28]: The next morning I was up at Mr Turnbull 's by the time agreed upon , but before I set off rather a singular occurrence took place .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 35]: I had just finished cleaning my boat , and had resumed my jacket , when a dark man , from some foreign country , came to the hard with a bundle under his arm .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 19]: `` How much for to go to the other side of the river -- how much pence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 30]: `` Twopence , '' replied I ; but not caring to take him , I continued , `` but you only pay one penny to cross the bridge . ''
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 13]: `` I know very well , but suppose you take me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 50]: He was a well-looking , not very dark man ; his turban was of coloured cloth -- his trousers not very wide ; and I could not comprehend whether he was a Turk or not ; I afterwards found out he was a Parsee , from the East Indies .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 6]: He spoke very plain English .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 34]: As he decided upon crossing , I received him , and shoved off ; when we were in the middle of the stream , he requested me to pull a little way up .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 25]: `` That will do , '' said he , opening his bundle , and spreading a carpet on the stern flooring of the wherry .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 83]: He then rose , looking at the sun , which was then rising in all its majesty , bowed to it , with his hands raised , three times , then knelt on the carpet , and touched it several times with his forehead , again rose to his feet , took some common field flowers from his vest , and cast them into the stream , bowed again , folded up his carpet , and begged me to pull on shore .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 21]: `` I say my prayers , '' said the man , looking at me with his dark , piercing eye .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 12]: `` Very proper ; whom did you say them to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 6]: `` To my God . ''
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 12]: `` But why do n't you say them on shore ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 20]: `` Ca n't see sun in the house ; suppose I go out little boys laugh and throw mud .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 11]: Where no am seen , river very proper place . ''
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 15]: We landed , and he took out threepence , and offered it to me .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 23]: `` No , no , '' said I ; `` I do n't want you to pay for saying your prayers . ''
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 6]: `` No take money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 18]: `` Yes , take money to cross the river , but not take money for saying prayers .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 29]: If you want to say them any other morning , come down , and if I am here , I 'll always pull you into the stream . ''
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 11]: `` You very good man ; I thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 12]: The Parsee made me a low salaam , and walked away .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 40]: I may here observe that the man generally came down at sunrise two or three days in the week , and I invariably gave him a pull off into the stream , that he might pursue his religious ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 9]: We often conversed and at last became intimate .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 32]: Mr Turnbull was at the bottom of the lawn , which extended from his house to the banks of the river , looking out for me , when I pulled up .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 17]: The basket with our dinner , etcetera , was lying by him on the gravel walk .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 50]: `` This is a lovely morning , Jacob ; but it will be rather a warm day , I expect , '' said he ; `` come , let us be off at once ; lay in your sculls , and let us get the oars to pass . ''
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 9]: `` How is Mrs Turnbull , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 22]: `` Pretty well , Jacob ; more like the Molly Brown that I married than she has been for some years .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 19]: Perhaps , after all , this affair may turn out one of the best things that ever happened .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 27]: It may bring her to her senses -- bring happiness back to our hearth ; if so , Jacob , the money is well spent . ''
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 35]: MR. TURNBULL AND I GO ON A PARTY OF PLEASURE -- IT TURNS OUT TO BE AN ADVENTURE , AND WINDS UP WITH A BLUNDERBUSS , A TIN-BOX , AND A LADY 'S CLOAK .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 40]: We pulled leisurely up the stream , talking , and every now and then resting on our oars to take breath ; for , as the old captain said , `` Why should we make a toil of pleasure ?
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 24]: I like the upper part of the river best , Jacob , because the water is clear , and I love clear water .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 84]: How many hours have I , when a boy on board ship , hung over the gunwale of a boat , lowered down in a calm , and watch the little floating objects in the dark blue unfathomable water beneath me ; objects of all sizes , of all colours , and of all shapes -- all of them beautiful and to be admired ; yet of them , perhaps , not one in a hundred millions ever meet the eye of man .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 56]: You know , Jacob , that the North Seas are full of these animals -- you can not imagine the quantity of them ; the sailors call them blubbers , because they are composed of a sort of transparent jelly but the real name I am told is Medusae , that is the learned name .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 21]: The whale feeds on them , and that is the reason why the whale is found where they are . ''
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 31]: `` I should like very much to go a voyage to the whale fishery , '' replied I ; `` I 've heard so much about it from you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 21]: `` It is a stirring life , and a hard life , Jacob ; still it is an exciting one .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 17]: Some voyages will turn out very pleasant , but others are dreadful , from their anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 27]: If the weather continues fine , it is all very well ; but sometimes when there is a continuance of bad weather , it is dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 26]: I recollect one voyage which made me show more grey hairs than all the others , and I think I have been twenty-two in all .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 35]: We were in the drift ice , forcing our way to the northward , when it came on to blow -- the sea rose , and after a week 's gale it was tremendous .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 103]: We had little daylight , and when it was daylight , the fog was so thick that we could see but little ; there we were tossing among the large drift ice , meeting immense icebergs which bore down with all the force of the gale , and each time we narrowly escaped perishing : the rigging was loaded with ice ; the bows of the ship were cased with it ; the men were more than half frozen , and we could not move a rope through a block without pouring boiling water through it first , to clear it out .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 50]: But then the long , dreary , dreadful nights , when we were rising on the mountain wave , and then pitching down into the trough , not knowing but that at each send we might strike upon the ice below , and go to the bottom immediately afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 80]: All pitchy dark -- the wind howling , and as it struck you , cutting you to the back-bone with its cold , searching power , the waves dancing all black around you , and every now and then perceiving by its white colour and the foam encircling it a huge mass of ice borne upon you , and hurled against you as if there were a demon , who was using it as an engine for your destruction .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 25]: I never shall forget the _ turning _ of an iceberg during the dreadful gale which lasted for a month and three days . ''
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 12]: `` I do n't know what that means , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 37]: `` Why , you must know , Jacob , that the icebergs are all fresh water , and are supposed to have been detached from the land by the force of the weather and other causes .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 42]: Now , although ice floats , yet it floats deep : that is , if an iceberg is five hundred feet high above the water , it is generally six times as deep below the water -- do you understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 6]: `` Perfectly , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 72]: `` Now , Jacob , the water is much warmer than the air , and in consequence , the ice under the water melts away much faster ; so that if the iceberg has been some time afloat , at last the part that is below is not so heavy as that which is above ; then it turns , that is , it upsets and floats in another position . ''
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 8]: `` I understand you , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 47]: `` Well , we were close to an iceberg , which was to windward of us , a very tall one , indeed , and we reckoned that we should get clear of it , for we were carrying a press of sail to effect it .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 20]: Still , all hands were eagerly watching the iceberg , as it came down very fast before the storm .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 29]: All of a sudden it blew twice as hard as before , and then one of the men shouted out -- ` _ Turning , turning _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 7]: -- and sure enough it was .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 23]: There was its towering summit gradually bowing towards us , until it almost appeared as if the peak was over our heads .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 29]: Our fate appeared inevitable , as the whole mountain of ice was descending on the vessel , and would , of course , have crushed us into atoms .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 38]: We all fell on our knees , praying mentally , and watching its awful descent ; even the man at the helm did the same , although he did not let go the spokes of the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 80]: It had nearly half turned over , right for us , when the ice below , being heavier on one side than on the other , gave it a more slanting impetus , and shifting the direction of its fall , it plunged into the sea about a cable 's length astern of us , throwing up the water to the heavens in foam , and blinding us all with the violence with which it dashed into our faces .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 79]: For a minute the run of the waves was checked , and the sea appeared to boil and dance , throwing up peaked , pointed masses of water in all directions , one sinking , another rising , the ship rocked and reeled as if she were drunk ; even the current of the gale was checked for a moment , and the heavy sails flapped and cleared themselves of their icy varnishing -- then all was over .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 42]: There was an iceberg of another shape astern of us , the gale recommenced , the waves pressed each other on as before , and we felt the return of the gale , awful as it was , as a reprieve .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 35]: That was a dreadful voyage , Jacob , and turned one-third of my hair grey ; and what made it worse was , that we had only three fish on board on our return .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 34]: However , we had reason to be thankful , for eighteen of our vessels were lost altogether , and it was the mercy of God that we were not among the number . ''
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 18]: `` Well , I suppose you told me that story to prevent my going a voyage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 58]: `` Not a bit , Jacob ; if it should chance that you find it your interest to go to the North Pole , or anywhere else , I would say go , by all means ; let neither difficulty nor danger deter you ; but do not go merely from curiosity ; that I consider foolish .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 63]: It 's all very well for those who come back to have the satisfaction to talk of such things , and it is but fair that they should have it ; but when you consider how many there are who never come back at all , why , then , it 's very foolish to push yourself into needless danger and privation .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 58]: You are amused with my recollections of Arctic voyages ; but just call to mind how many years of hardship , of danger , cold , and starvation I have undergone to collect all these anecdotes , and then judge whether it be worth any man 's while to go for the sake of mere curiosity . ''
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 24]: I then amused Mr Turnbull with the description of the picnic party , which lasted until we had pulled far beyond Kew Bridge .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 45]: We thrust the bow of the wherry into a bunch of sedges , and then we sat down to our meal , surrounded by hundreds of blue dragon-flies , that flitted about as if to inquire what we meant by intruding upon their domiciles .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 23]: We continued there chatting and amusing ourselves till it was late , and then shoved off and pulled down with the stream .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 39]: The sun had set , and we had yet six or seven miles to return to Mr Turnbull 's house , when we perceived a slight , handsome young man in a skiff , who pulled towards us .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 34]: `` I say , my lads , '' said he , taking us both for watermen , `` have you a mind to earn a couple of guineas with very little trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 18]: `` Oh , yes , '' replied Mr Turnbull , `` if you can show us how .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 14]: A fine chance for you , Jacob , '' continued he , aside .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 42]: `` Well , then , I shall want your services , perhaps , for not more than an hour ; it may be a little longer , as there is a lady in question , and we may have to wait .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 14]: All I ask is , that you pull well and do your best .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 5]: Are you agreed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 18]: We consented ; and he requested us to follow him , and then pulled for the shore .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 28]: `` This is to be an adventure , sir , '' said I. `` So it seems , '' replied Mr Turnbull ; `` all the better .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 14]: I 'm old now , but I 'm fond of a spree . ''
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 34]: The gentleman pulled into a little boat-house by the river 's side , belonging to one of the villas on the bank , made fast his boat , and then stepped into ours .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 17]: `` Now , we 've plenty of time ; just pull quietly for the present . ''
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 54]: We continued down the river , and after we had passed Kew Bridge , he directed us in shore , on the right side , till we came to a garden sweeping down to the river from a cottage _ ornee _ , of large dimensions , about fifty yards from the bank .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 19]: The water was up to the brick-wall , which rose from the river about four or five feet .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 29]: `` That will do , st -- , st -- , not a word , '' said he , rising in the stern sheets , and looking over .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 35]: After a minute or two reconnoitring , he climbed from the boat on to the parapet of the wall , and whistled two bars of an air which I had till then never heard .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 4]: All was silent .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 33]: He crouched behind a lilac bush , and in a minute he repeated the same air in a whistle as before ; still there was no appearance of movement at the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 32]: He continued at intervals to whistle the portion of the air , and at last a light appeared at an upper window : it was removed , and re-appeared three times .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 12]: `` Be ready now , my lads , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 31]: In about two minutes afterwards , a female , in a cloak , appeared , coming down the lawn , with a box in her hand , panting with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 37]: `` Oh , William , I heard your first signal , but I could not get into my uncle 's room for the box ; at last he went out , and here it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 17]: The gentleman seized the box from her , and handed it to us in the boat .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 38]: `` Take great care of that , my lads , '' said he ; `` and now , Cecilia , we have no time to lose ; the sooner you are in the boat the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 12]: `` How am I to get down there , William ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 3]: replied she .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 7]: `` Oh , nothing more easy .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 44]: Stop , throw your cloak into the boat , and then all you have to do is , first to get upon the top of the wall , and then trust to the watermen below and to me above for helping you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 44]: It was not , however , quite so easy a matter ; the wall was four feet high above the boat , and moreover , there was a trellised work of iron , above a foot high , which ran along the wall .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 33]: Still , she made every effort on her own part , and we considered that we had arranged so as to conquer the difficulty , when the young lady gave a scream .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 12]: We looked up and beheld a third party on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 37]: It was a stout , tall , elderly man , as far as we could perceive in the dark , who immediately seized hold of the lady by the arm , and was dragging her away .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 35]: This was resisted by the young gentleman , and the lady was relinquished by the other , to defend himself ; at the same time that he called out -- `` Help , help !
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 5]: Thieves , thieves ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 9]: `` Shall I go to his assistance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 6]: said I to Mr Turnbull .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 9]: `` One must stay in the boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 18]: `` Jump up , then , Jacob , for I never could get up that wall . ''
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 46]: I was up in a moment , and gaining my feet , was about to spring to the help of the young man , when four servants , with lights and with arms in their hands , made their appearance , hastening down the lawn .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 31]: The lady had fainted on the grass ; the elderly gentleman and his antagonist were down together , but the elderly gentleman had the mastery , for he was uppermost .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 18]: Perceiving the assistance coming , he called out `` Look to the watermen , secure them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 11]: I perceived that not a moment was to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 17]: I could be of no service , and Mr Turnbull might be in an awkward scrape .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 33]: I sprang into the boat , shoved off , and we were in the stream and at thirty yards ' distance before they looked over the wall to see where we were .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 7]: `` Stop , in that boat !
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 3]: stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 3]: they cried .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 13]: `` Fire , if they do n't , '' cried their master .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 8]: We pulled as hard as we could .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 23]: A musquetoon was discharged , but the shot dropped short ; the only person who fell was the man who fired it .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 58]: To see us he had stood upon the coping bricks of the wall , and the recoil tumbled him over into the river : we saw him fall , and heard the splash ; but we pulled on as hard as we could , and in a few minutes the scene of action was far behind us .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 25]: We then struck across to the other side of the river , and when we had gained close to the shore we took breath .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 30]: `` Well , '' said Mr Turnbull , `` this is a spree I little looked for ; to have a blunderbuss full of shot sent after me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 24]: `` No , '' replied I , laughing , `` that 's carrying the joke rather too far on the river Thames . ''
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 32]: `` Well , but what a pretty mess we are in : here we have property belonging to God knows whom ; and what are we to do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 53]: `` I think , sir , the best thing we can do is , for you to land at your own house with the property , and take care of it until we find out what all this is about ; and I will continue on with the sculls to the hard .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 27]: I shall hear or find out something about it in a day or two ; they may still follow up the pursuit and trace us . ''
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 32]: `` The advice is good , '' replied Mr Turnbull , `` and the sooner we cut over again the better , for we are nearly abreast of my place . ''
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 4]: We did so .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 27]: Mr Turnbull landed in his garden , taking with him the tin-box -LRB- it was what they call a deed-box -RRB- and the lady 's cloak .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 24]: I did not wait , but boating the oars , took my sculls and pulled down to Fulham as fast as I could .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 28]: I had arrived , and was pulling gently in , not to injure the other boats , when a man with a lantern came into the wherry .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 12]: `` Have you anything in your boat , my man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 9]: `` Nothing , sir , '' replied I .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 10]: The man examined the boat , and was satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 20]: `` Tell me , did you see a boat with two men in it as you came along ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 16]: `` No , sir , '' replied I , `` nothing has passed me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 9]: `` Where do you come from now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 10]: `` From a gentleman 's place near Brentford . ''
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 3]: `` Brentford ?
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 10]: Oh , then , you were far below them .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 7]: They are not down yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 11]: `` Have you a job for me , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 12]: said I , not wishing to appear anxious to go away .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 11]: `` No , my man , no ; nothing to-night .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 23]: We are on the lookout , but we have two boats in the stream , and a man at each landing-place . ''
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 23]: I made fast my boat , shouldered my oars and sculls , and departed , not at all sorry to get away .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 55]: It appeared that as soon as it was ascertained that we were not to be stopped by being fired at , they saddled horses , and the distance by the road being so much shorter , had , by galloping as hard as they could , arrived at Fulham some ten minutes before me .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 21]: It was , therefore , most fortunate that the box had been landed , or I should have been discovered .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 25]: That the contents were of value was evident , from the anxiety to secure them ; but the mystery was still to be solved .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 15]: I was quite tired with exertion and excitement when I arrived at Stapleton 's .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 25]: Mary was there to give me my supper , which I ate in silence , complained of a headache , and went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 43]: THE WATERMAN TURNS WATER-KNIGHT -- I BECOME CHIVALROUS , SEE A BEAUTIFUL FACE , AND GO WITH THE STREAM -- THE ADVENTURE SEEMS TO PROMISE MORE LAW THAN LOVE , THERE BEING PAPERS IN THE CASE THAT IS , IN A TIN-BOX .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 28]: That night I dreamed of nothing but the scene , over and over again , and the two bars of music were constantly ringing in my ears .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 24]: As soon as I had breakfasted the next morning I set off to Mr Turnbull 's , and told him what had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 85]: `` It was indeed fortunate that the box was landed , '' said he , `` or you might have now been in prison ; I wish I had had nothing to do with it ; but , as you say , ` what 's done ca n't be helped ; ' I will not give up the box , at all events , until I know which party is entitled to it , and I can not help thinking that the lady is .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 18]: But , Jacob , you will have to reconnoitre , and find out what this story is .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 18]: Tell me , do you think you could remember the tune which he whistled so often ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 26]: `` It has been running in my head the whole night , and I have been trying it all the way as I pulled here .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 7]: I think I have it exact .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 5]: Hear , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 7]: -- I whistled the two bars .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 18]: `` Quite correct , Jacob , quite correct ; well , take care not to forget them .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 7]: Where are you going to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 6]: `` Nowhere , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 57]: `` Suppose , then , you pull up the river , and find out the place where we landed , and when you have ascertained that , you can go on and see whether the young man is with the skiff ; at all events you may find out something -- but pray be cautious . ''
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 29]: I promised to be very careful , and departed on my errand , which I undertook with much pleasure , for I was delighted with anything like adventure .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 20]: I pulled up the river , and in about an hour and a-quarter , came abreast of the spot .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 33]: I recognised the cottage _ ornee _ , the parapet wall , even the spot where we lay , and perceived that several bricks were detached and had fallen into the river .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 54]: There appeared to be no one stirring in the house , yet I continued to pull up and down , looking at the windows ; at last one opened , and a young lady looked out , who , I was persuaded , was the same that we had seen the night before .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 11]: There was no wind , and all was quiet around .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 13]: She sat at the window , leaning her head on her hand .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 9]: I whistled the two bars of the air .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 19]: At the first bar she started up , and looked earnestly at me as I completed the second .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 16]: I looked up ; she waved her handkerchief once , and then shut the window .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 18]: In a few seconds she made her appearance on the lawn , walking down towards the river .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 8]: I immediately pulled in under the wall .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 16]: I laid in my sculls , and held on , standing up in the boat .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 5]: `` Who are you ?
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 6]: and who sent you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 21]: said she , looking down on me , and discovering one of the most beautiful faces I had ever beheld .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 21]: `` No one sent me ma'am , '' replied I , `` but I was in the boat last night .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 18]: I am sorry you were so unfortunate , but your box and cloak are quite safe . ''
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 11]: `` You were one of the men in the boat .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 13]: I trust no one was hurt when they fired at you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 5]: `` No ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 8]: `` And where is the box ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 13]: `` In the house of the person who was with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 6]: `` Can he be trusted ?
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 10]: For they will offer large rewards for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 36]: `` I should think so , ma'am , '' replied I , smiling ; `` the person who was with me is a gentleman of large fortune , who was amusing himself on the river .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 24]: He desires me to say that he will not give up the box until he knows to whom the contents legally belong . ''
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 7]: `` Good heavens , how fortunate !
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 7]: Am I to believe you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 9]: `` I should hope so , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 8]: `` And what are you , then ?
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 7]: You are not a waterman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 9]: `` Yes , ma'am , I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 27]: She paused , looked earnestly at me for a little while , and then continued , `` How did you learn the air you whistled ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 16]: `` The young gentleman whistled it six or seven times last night before you came .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 21]: I tried it this morning coming up , as I thought it would be the means of attracting your attention .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 12]: Can I be of any service to you , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 21]: `` Service -- yes , if I could be sure you were to be trusted -- of the greatest service .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 29]: I am confined here -- can not send a letter -- watched as I move -- only allowed the garden , and even watched while I walk here .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 27]: They are most of them in quest of the tin box to-day , or I should not be able to talk to you so long . ''
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 25]: She looked round at the house anxiously , and then said , `` Stop here a minute , while I walk a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 13]: She then retreated , and paced up and down the garden walk .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 17]: I still remained under the wall , so as not to be perceived from the house .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 46]: In about three or four minutes she returned and said , `` It would be very cruel -- it would be more than cruel -- it would be very wicked of you to deceive me , for I am very unfortunate and very unhappy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 7]: The tears started in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 10]: `` You do not look as if you would .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 6]: What is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 24]: `` Jacob Faithful , ma'am , and I will be true to my name , if you will put your trust in me .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 27]: I never deceived any one that I can recollect ; and I 'm sure I would not you -- now that I 've seen you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 10]: `` Yes , but money will seduce everybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 6]: `` Not me , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 10]: I 've as much as I wish for . ''
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 28]: `` Well , then , I will trust you , and think you sent from heaven to my aid ; but how am I to see you ?
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 42]: To-morrow my uncle will be back , and then I shall not be able to speak to you one moment , and if seen to speak to you , you will be laid in wait for , and perhaps shot . ''
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 24]: `` Well , ma'am , '' replied I , after a pause , `` if you can not speak , you can write .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 12]: You see that the bricks on the parapet are loose here .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 42]: Put your letter under this brick -- I can take it away even in day-time , without being noticed , and can put the answer in the same place , so that you can secure it when you come out . ''
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 5]: `` How very clever !
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 9]: Good heavens , what an excellent idea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 16]: `` Was the young gentleman hurt , ma'am , in the scuffle last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 30]: inquired I. `` No , I believe not much , but I wish to know where he is , to write to him ; could you find out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 14]: I told her where we had met him , and what had passed .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 39]: `` That was Lady Auburn 's , '' replied she ; `` he is often there -- she is our cousin but I do n't know where he lives , and how to find him I know not .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 6]: His name is William Wharncliffe .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 10]: Do you think you could find him out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 14]: `` Yes , ma'am , with a little trouble it might be done .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 13]: They ought to know where he is at Lady Auburn 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 18]: `` Yes , some of the servants might -- but how will you get to them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 10]: `` That , ma'am , I must find out .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 37]: It may not be done in one day , or two days , but if you will look every morning under this brick , if there is anything to communicate you will find it there . ''
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 10]: `` You can write and read , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 14]: `` I should hope so , ma'am , '' replied I , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 11]: `` I do n't know what to make of you .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 7]: Are you really a waterman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 19]: `` Really , and -- '' She turned her head round at the noise of a window opening .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 16]: `` You must go -- do n't forget the brick ; '' and she disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 85]: I shoved my wherry along by the side of the wall , so as to remain unperceived until I was clear of the frontage attached to the cottage ; and then , taking my sculls , pulled into the stream ; and as I was resolved to see if I could obtain any information at Lady Auburn 's , I had to pass the garden again , having shoved my boat down the river instead of up , when I was under the wall .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 30]: I perceived the young lady walking with a tall man by her side ; he speaking very energetically , and using much gesticulation , she holding down her head .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 11]: In another minute they were shut out from my sight .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 34]: I was so much stricken with the beauty and sweetness of expression in the young lady 's countenance that I was resolved to use my best exertions to be of service to her .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 34]: In about an hour-and-a-half I had arrived at the villa , abreast of which we had met the young gentleman , and which the young lady had told me belonged to Lady Auburn .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 15]: I could see no one in the grounds , nor indeed in the house .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 29]: After watching a few minutes , I landed as near to the villa as I could , made fast the wherry , and walked round to the entrance .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 14]: There was no lodge , but a servant 's door at one side .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 19]: I pulled the bell , having made up my mind how to proceed as I was walking up .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 25]: The bell was answered by an old woman , who , in a snarling tone , asked me `` what did I want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 20]: `` I am waiting below , with my boat , for Mr Wharncliffe ; has he come yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 4]: `` Mr Wharncliffe !
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 23]: No -- he 's not come ; nor did he say that he would come ; when did you see him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 3]: `` Yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 7]: Is Lady Auburn at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 34]: `` Lady Auburn -- no ; she went to town this morning ; everybody goes to London now , that they may not see the flowers and green trees , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 22]: `` But I suppose Mr Wharncliffe will come , '' continued I , `` so I must wait for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 24]: `` You can do just as you like , '' replied the old woman , about to shut the gate in my face .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 57]: `` May I request a favour of you , ma'am , before you shut the gate -- which is , to bring me a little water to drink , for the sun is hot , and I have had a long pull up here ; '' and I took out my handkerchief and wiped my face .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 20]: `` Yes , I 'll fetch you some , '' replied she , shutting the gate and going away .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 16]: `` This do n't seem to answer very well , '' thought I to myself .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 17]: The old woman returned , opened the gate , and handed me a mug of water .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 12]: I drank some , thanked her , and returned the mug .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 24]: `` I am very tired , '' said I ; `` I should like to sit down and wait for the gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 11]: `` Do n't you sit down when you pull ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 5]: inquired the old woman .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 49]: `` Yes , '' replied I. `` Then you must be tired of sitting , I should think , not of standing ; at all events , if you want to sit , you can sit in your boat , and mind it at the same time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 18]: With this observation she shut the door upon me , and left me without any more comment .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 32]: After this decided repulse on the part of the old woman , I had nothing to do but take her advice -- viz. , to go and look after my boat .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 17]: I pulled down to Mr Turnbull 's , and told him my good and bad fortune .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 22]: It being late , he ordered me some dinner in his study , and we sat there canvassing over the affair .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 38]: `` Well , '' said he , as we finished , `` you must allow me to consider this as my affair , Jacob , as I was the occasion of our getting mixed up in it .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 43]: You must do all that you can to find this young man , and I shall hire Stapleton 's boat by the day until we succeed ; you need not tell him so , or he may be anxious to know why .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 10]: To-morrow you go down to old Beazeley 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 13]: `` Yes , sir ; you can not hire me to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 17]: `` Still I shall , as I want to see you to-morrow morning before you go .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 14]: Here 's Stapleton 's money for yesterday and to-day and now good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 20]: I was at Mr Turnbull 's early the next morning , and found him with the newspapers before him .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 17]: `` I expected this , Jacob , '' said he ; `` read that advertisement . ''
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 60]: I read as follows : -- `` Whereas , on Friday night last , between the hours of nine and ten , a tin box , containing deeds and papers , was handed into a wherry from the grounds of a villa between Brentford and Kew , and the parties who owned it were prevented from accompanying the same .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 40]: This is to give notice , that a reward of twenty pounds will be paid to the watermen , upon their delivering up the same to Messrs. James and John White , of Number 14 Lincoln 's Inn Fields .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 24]: As no other parties are authorised to receive the said tin box of papers , all other applications for it must be disregarded .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 10]: An early attention to this advertisement will oblige . ''
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 47]: `` There must be papers of no little consequence in that box , Jacob , depend upon it , '' said Mr Turnbull ; `` however , here they are , and here they shall remain until I know more about it ; that 's certain .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 36]: I intend to try what I can do myself with the old woman , for I perceive the villa is to be let for three months -- here is the advertisement in the last column .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 26]: I shall go to town to-day , and obtain a ticket from the agent , and it is hard but I 'll ferret out something .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 6]: I shall see you to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 8]: Now you may go , Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 34]: I hastened away , as I had promised to be down to old Tom 's to breakfast ; an hour 's smart pulling brought me to the landing-place , opposite to his house .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 40]: A TEN-POUND HOUSEHOLDER OCCUPIED WITH AFFAIRS OF STATE -- THE ADVANTAGE OF THE WORD `` IMPLICATION '' -- AN UNEXPECTED MEETING AND A RECONCILIATION -- RESOLUTION VERSUS BRIGHT BLACK EYES -- VERDICT FOR THE DEFENDANT , WITH HEAVY DAMAGES .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 49]: The house of old Tom Beazeley was situated on the verge of Battersea Fields , about a mile-and-a-half from the bridge bearing the same name ; the river about twenty yards before it -- the green grass behind it , and not a tree within half-a-mile of it .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 117]: There was nothing picturesque in it but its utter loneliness ; it was not only lonely , but isolated , for it was fixed upon a delta of about half-an-acre , between two creeks , which joined at about forty yards from the river , and ran up through the fields , so that the house was at high water upon an island , and at low water was defended by an impassable barrier of mud , so that the advances to it could be made only from the river , where a small _ hard _ , edged with posts worn down to the conformation of decayed double-teeth , offered the only means of access .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 84]: The house itself was one storey high ; dark red bricks , and darker tiles upon the roof ; windows very scarce and very small , although built long before the damnable tax upon light , for it was probably built in the time of Elizabeth , to judge by the peculiarity of the style of architecture observable in the chimneys ; but it matters very little at what epoch was built a tenement which was rented at only ten pounds per annum .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 33]: The major part of the said island was stocked with cabbage plants ; but on one side there was half a boat set upright , with a patch of green before it .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 85]: At the time that old Beazeley hired it there was a bridge rudely constructed of old ship plank , by which you could gain a path which led across the Battersea Fields ; but as all the communications of old Tom were by water , and Mrs Beazeley never ventured over the bridge , it was gradually knocked away for firewood , and when it was low-water , one old post , redolent of mud , marked the spot where the bridge had been .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 7]: The interior was far more inviting .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 37]: Mrs Beazeley was a clean person and frugal housewife , and every article in the kitchen , which was the first room you entered , was as clean and as bright as industry could make it .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 49]: There was a parlour also , seldom used ; both of the inmates , when they did meet , which was not above a day or two in three weeks , during the time that old Beazeley was in charge of the lighter , preferring comfort to grandeur .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 20]: In this isolated house , upon this isolated spot , did Mrs Beazeley pass a life of most isolation .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 32]: And yet , perhaps there never was a more lively or a more happy woman than Mrs Beazeley , for she was strong and in good health , and always employed .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 37]: She knew that her husband was following up his avocation on the river , and laying by a provision for their old age , which she herself was adding considerably to it by her own exertions .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 33]: She had married old Tom long before he had lost his legs , at a time when he was a prime , active sailor , and the best man of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 23]: She was a net-maker 's daughter , and had been brought up to the business , at which she was very expert .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 49]: The most difficult part of the art is that of making large _ seines _ for taking sea-fish ; and when she had no order for those to complete , the making of casting-nets beguiled away her time as soon as her household cares had been disposed of .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 28]: She made money and husbanded it , not only for herself and her partner , but for her son , young Tom , upon whom she doted .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 54]: So accustomed was she to work hard and be alone that it was most difficult to say whether she was most pleased or most annoyed when her husband and son made their appearance for a day or two , and the latter was alternately fondled and scolded during the whole of his sojourn .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 25]: Tom , as the reader may suppose from a knowledge of his character , caring about as much for the one as the other .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 14]: I pulled into the _ hard _ , and made fast my boat .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 38]: There was no one outside the door when I landed ; on entering , I found them all seated at the table , and a grand display of fragments , in the shape of herring-bones , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 39]: `` Well , Jacob -- come at last -- thought you had forgot us ; piped to breakfast at eight bells -- always do , you know , '' said old Tom , on my making my appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 10]: `` Have you had your breakfast , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 4]: said Mrs Beazeley .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 25]: `` No , '' replied I ; `` I was obliged to go up to Mr Turnbull 's , and that detained me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 20]: `` No more sodgers , Jacob , '' said Tom ; `` father and I eat them all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 5]: `` Have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 39]: replied Mrs Beazeley , taking two more red herrings out of the cupboard , and putting them on the fire to grill ; `` no , no , master Tom , there 's some for Jacob yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 24]: `` Well , mother , you make nets to some purpose , for you 've always a fish when it 's wanted . ''
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 51]: I despatched my breakfast , and as soon as all had been cleared away by his wife , old Tom , crossing his two timber legs , commenced business , for it appeared , what I was not aware of , that we had met on a sort of council-of-war .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 21]: `` Jacob , sit down by me ; old woman , bring yourself to an anchor in the high chair .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 11]: Tom , sit anywhere , so you sit still . ''
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 17]: `` And leave my net alone , Tom , '' cried his mother , in parenthesis .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 32]: -- `` You see , Jacob , the whole long and short of it is this -- I feel my toes more and more , and flannel 's no longer warm .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 27]: I ca n't tide it any longer , and I think it high time to lie up in ordinary and moor abreast of the old woman .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 18]: Now , there 's Tom , in the first place , what 's to do with he ?
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 46]: I think that I 'll build him a wherry , and as I 'm free of the river he can finish his apprenticeship with my name on the boat ; but to build him a wherry would be rather a heavy pull for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 26]: `` If you mean to build it yourself , I think it will prove a _ heavy pull _ for me , '' replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 18]: `` Silence , Tom ; I built you , and God knows you 're light enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 15]: `` And , Tom , leave my net alone , '' cried his mother .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 9]: `` Father made me light-fingered , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 20]: `` Ay , and light-hearted too , boy , '' rejoined the dame , looking fondly at her son .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 26]: `` Well , '' continued old Tom , `` supposing that Tom be provided for in that way ; then now I comes to myself .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 47]: I 've an idea that I can do a good bit of work in patching up boats ; for you see I always was a bit of a carpenter , and I know how the builders extortionate the poor watermen when there 's a trifle amiss .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 26]: Now , if they knew I could do it , they 'd all come to me fast enough ; but then there 's a puzzle .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 14]: I 've been thinking this week how I can make them know it .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 30]: I ca n't put out a board and say , Beazeley , _ Boat-builder _ , because I 'm no boatbuilder , but still I want a sign . ''
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 13]: `` Lord , father , have n't you got one already ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 25]: interrupted young Tom ; `` you 've half a boat stuck up there , and that means that you 're half a boat-builder . ''
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 14]: `` Silence , Tom , with your frippery ; what do you think .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 3]: Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 13]: `` Could you not say , ` Boats repaired here ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 24]: `` Yes , but that wo n't exactly do ; they like to employ a builder -- and there 's the puzzle . ''
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 47]: `` Not half so puzzling as this net , '' observed Tom , who had taken up the needle , unseen by his mother , and begun to work ; `` I 've made only ten stitches , and six of them are long ones . ''
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 18]: `` Tom , Tom , you good-for-nothing -- why do n't you let my net alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 24]: cried Mrs Beazeley ; `` now ` twill take me as much time to undo ten stitches as to have made fifty . ''
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 7]: `` All right , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 15]: `` No , Tom , all 's wrong ; look at these meshes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 12]: `` Well , then , all 's fair , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 16]: `` No , all 's foul , boy ; look how it 's tangled . ''
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 60]: `` Still , I say , all 's fair , mother , for it is but fair to give the fish one or two chances to get away , and that 's just what I 've done ; and now , father , I 'll settle your affair to your own satisfaction , as I have mother 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 23]: `` That will be queer satisfaction , Tom , I guess ; but let 's hear what you have to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 31]: `` Then , father , it seems that you 're no boat-builder , but you want people to fancy that you are -- a 'n' t that the question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 19]: `` Why , 't is something like it , Tom , but I do nobody no harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 13]: `` Certainly not ; it 's only the boats which will suffer .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 25]: Now , get a large board , with ` Boats _ built to order _ , and boats repaired , by Tom Beazeley . '
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 38]: You know if any man is fool enough to order a boat , that 's his concern ; you did n't say you 're a boat-builder , although you have no objection to try your hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 8]: `` What do you say Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 8]: said old Tom , appealing to me .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 18]: `` I think that Tom has given very good advice , and I would follow it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 12]: Tom has a head , '' said Mrs Beazeley , fondly .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 12]: `` Tom , let go my net again , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 6]: What a boy you are !
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 26]: Now touch it again if you dare , '' and Mrs Beazeley took up a little poker from the fire-place and shook it at him .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 41]: `` Tom has a head , indeed , '' said young Tom , `` but as he has no wish to have it broken , Jacob , lend me your wherry for half-an-hour , and I 'll be off . ''
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 65]: I assented , and Tom , first tossing the cat upon his mother 's back , made his escape , crying : `` Lord , Molly , what a fish -- '' as the animal fixed in its claws to save herself from falling , making Mrs Beazeley roar out and vow vengeance , while old Tom and I could not refrain from laughter .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 37]: After Tom 's departure the conversation was renewed , and everything was finally arranged between old Tom and his wife , except the building of the wherry , at which the old woman shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 27]: The debate would be too long , and not sufficiently interesting to detail ; one part , however , I must make the reader acquainted with .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 28]: After entering into all the arrangements of the house , Mrs Beazeley took me upstairs to show me the rooms , which were very neat and clean .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 28]: I came down with her , and old Tom said , `` Did the old woman show you the room with the white curtains , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 17]: `` Yes , '' replied I , `` and a very nice one it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 13]: `` Well , Jacob , there 's nothing sure in this world .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 41]: You 're well off at present , and ` leave well alone ' is a good motto ; but recollect this , that room is for you when you want it , and everything else we can share with you .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 13]: It 's offered freely , and you will accept it the same .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 8]: Is it not , old lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 30]: `` Yes , that it is , Jacob ; but may you do better -- if not , I 'll be your mother for want of a better . ''
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 27]: I was moved with the kindness of the old couple ; the more so as I did not know what I had done to deserve it .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 30]: Old Tom gave me a hearty squeeze of the hand , and then continued -- `` But about this wherry -- what do you say , old woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 7]: `` What will it cost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 5]: replied she , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 25]: `` Cost ; let me see -- a good wherry , with sculls and oars , will be a matter of thirty pounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 21]: The old woman screwed up her mouth , shook her head , and then walked away to prepare for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 21]: `` I think she could muster the blunt , Jacob , but she do n't like to part with it .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 5]: Tom must coax her .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 11]: I wish he had n't shied the cat at her .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 8]: He 's too full of fun . ''
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 15]: As old Beazeley finished , I perceived a wherry pulling in with some ladies .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 14]: I looked attentively , and recognised my own boat , and Tom pulling .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 29]: In a minute more they were at the _ hard _ , and who , to my astonishment , were there seated , but Mrs Drummond and Sarah .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 52]: As Tom got out of the boat and held it steady against the _ hard _ , he called to me ; I could not do otherwise than go and assist them out ; and once more did I touch the hands of those whom I never thought to meet again .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 26]: Mrs Drummond retained my hand a short time after she landed , saying , `` We are friends , Jacob , are we not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 19]: `` Oh , yes , madam , '' replied I , much moved , in a faltering voice .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 21]: `` I shall not ask that question , '' said Sarah , gaily , `` for we parted friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 30]: And as I recalled to mind her affectionate behaviour , I pressed her hand , and the tears glistened in my eyes as I looked into her sweet face .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 25]: As I afterwards discovered , this was an arranged plan with old and young Tom , to bring about a meeting without my knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 63]: Mrs Beazeley courtesied and stroked her apron -- smiled at the ladies , looked very _ cat _ - ish at Tom , showed the ladies into the house , where old Tom assisted to do the honours after his own fashion , by asking Mrs Drummond if she would like to _ whet her whistle _ after her _ pull _ .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 18]: Mrs Drummond looked round to me for explanation , but young Tom thought proper to be interpreter .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 39]: `` Father wants to know , if you please , ma'am , whether , after your _ pull _ in the boat , you would n't like to have a _ pull _ at the brandy bottle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 22]: `` No , '' replied Mrs Drummond , smiling ; `` but I should be obliged for a glass of water .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 9]: Will you get me one , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 15]: I hastened to comply , and Mrs Drummond entered into conversation with Mrs Beazeley .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 19]: Sarah looked at me , and went to the door , turning back as inviting me to follow .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 18]: I did so , and we soon found ourselves seated on the bench in the old boat .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 25]: `` Jacob , '' said she , looking earnestly at me , `` you surely will be friends with _ my _ father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 29]: I think I should have shaken my head , but she laid an emphasis on _ my _ , which the little gipsy knew would have its effect .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 43]: All my resolutions , all my pride , all my sense of injury vanished before the mild , beautiful eyes of Sarah , and I replied hastily , `` Yes , Miss Sarah , I can refuse _ you _ nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 9]: `` Why _ Miss _ , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 14]: `` I am a waterman , and you are much above me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 15]: `` That is your own fault ; but say no more about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 45]: `` I must say something more , which is this : do not attempt to make me leave my present employment ; I am happy , because I am independent ; and that I will , if possible , be for the future . ''
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 11]: `` Any one can pull an oar , Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 21]: `` Very true , Miss Sarah , and is under no obligation to any one by so earning his livelihood .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 11]: He works for all and is paid for all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 10]: `` Will you come and see us , Jacob ?
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 9]: Come to-morrow -- now do -- promise me .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 10]: Will you refuse your old playmate , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 10]: `` I wish you would not ask that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 14]: `` How then can you say that you are friends with my father ?
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 12]: I will not believe you unless you promise to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 33]: `` Sarah , '' replied I , earnestly , `` I will come ; and to prove to you that we are friends , I will ask a favour of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 21]: `` Oh , Jacob , this is kind indeed , '' cried Sarah , with her eyes swimming with tears .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 12]: `` You have made me so -- so very happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 18]: The meeting with Sarah humanised me , and every feeling of revenge was chased from my memory .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 12]: Mrs Drummond joined us soon after , and proposed to return .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 12]: `` And Jacob will pull us back , '' cried Sarah .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 16]: `` Come , sir , look after your _ fare _ , in both senses .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 12]: Since you will be a waterman , you shall work . ''
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 9]: I laughed and handed them to the boat .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 18]: Tom took the other oar , and we were soon at the steps close to their house .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 26]: `` Mamma , we ought to give these poor fellows something to drink ; they 've worked very hard , '' said Sarah , mocking .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 9]: `` Come up , my good men . ''
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 3]: I hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 11]: `` Nay , Jacob , if tomorrow why not to-day ?
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 10]: The sooner these things are over the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 12]: I felt the truth of this observation , and followed her .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 39]: In a few minutes I was again in that parlour in which I had been dismissed , and in which the affectionate girl burst into tears on my shoulder , as I held the handle of the door .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 10]: I looked at it , and looked at Sarah .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 18]: Mrs Drummond had gone out of the room to let Mr Drummond know that I had come .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 9]: `` How kind you were , Sarah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 31]: said I. `` Yes , but kind people are cross sometimes , and so am I -- and so was -- '' Mr Drummond came in , and stopped her .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 26]: `` Jacob , I am glad to see you again in my house ; I was deceived by appearances , and did you injustice . ''
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 51]: How true is the observation of the wise man , that a soft word turneth away wrath ; that Mr Drummond should personally acknowledge that he was wrong to me -- that he should confess it -- every feeling of resentment was gone , and others crowded in their place .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 49]: I recollected how he had protected the orphan -- how he had provided him with instruction -- how he had made _ his _ house a home to me -- how he had tried to bring me forward under his own protection I recollected -- which , alas !
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 34]: I never should have forgotten -- that he had treated me for years with kindness and affection , all of which had been obliterated from my memory by one single act of injustice .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 23]: I felt that I was a culprit , and burst into tears ; and Sarah , as before , cried in sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 38]: `` I beg your pardon , Mr Drummond , '' said I , as soon as I could speak ; `` I have been very wrong in being so revengeful after so much kindness from you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 42]: `` We both have been wrong -- but say no more on the subject , Jacob ; I have an order to give , and then I will come up to you again ; '' and Mr Drummond quitted the room .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 16]: `` You dear , good boy , '' said Sarah , coming up to me .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 10]: `` Now , I really do love you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 17]: What I might have replied was put a stop to by Mrs Drummond entering the room .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 50]: She made a few inquiries about where I at present resided , and Sarah was catechising me rather inquisitively about Mary Stapleton , when Mr Drummond re-entered the room , and shook me by the hand with a warmth which made me more ashamed of my conduct towards him .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 28]: The conversation became general , but still rather embarrassed , when Sarah whispered to me `` What is the favour you would ask of my father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 40]: I had forgotten it at the moment , but I immediately told him that I would be obliged if he would allow me to have a part of the money belonging to me which he held in his possession .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 21]: `` That I will , with pleasure , and without asking what you intend to do with it , Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 7]: How much do you require ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 11]: `` Thirty pounds , if there is so much . ''
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 19]: Mr Drummond went down , and in a few minutes returned with the sum in notes and guineas .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 11]: I thanked him , and shortly afterwards took my leave .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 16]: `` Did not young Beazeley tell you I had something for you , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 9]: said Sarah , as I wished her good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 8]: `` Yes ; what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 13]: `` You must come and see , '' replied Sarah , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 24]: Thus was a finale to all my revenge brought about by a little girl of fifteen years old , with large dark eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 18]: Tom had taken his glass of grog below , and was waiting for me at the steps .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 18]: We shoved off , and returned to his father 's house , where dinner was just ready .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 23]: After dinner old Tom recommenced the argument ; `` The only hitch , '' says he , `` is about the wherry .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 9]: What do you say , old woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 7]: The old woman shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 47]: `` As that is the only hitch , '' said I , `` I can remove it , for here is the money for the wherry , which I make a present to Tom , '' and I put the money into young Tom 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 15]: Tom counted it out before his father and mother , much to their astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 25]: `` You are a good fellow , Jacob , '' said Tom ; `` but I say , do you recollect Wimbledon Common ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 5]: `` What then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 12]: replied I. `` Only Jerry Abershaw , that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 14]: `` Do not be afraid , Tom , it is honestly mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 15]: `` But how did you get it , Jacob , '' said old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 42]: It may appear strange , but , impelled by a wish to serve my friends , I had asked for the money which I knew belonged to me , but never thought of the manner in which it had been obtained .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 22]: The question of old Tom recalled everything to my memory , and I shuddered when I recollected the circumstances attending it .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 11]: I was confused , and did not like to reply .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 21]: `` Be satisfied , the money is mine , '' replied I. `` Yes , Jacob , but how ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 22]: replied Mrs Beazeley ; `` surely you ought to be able to tell how you got so large a sum . ''
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 34]: `` Jacob has some reason for not telling , missus , depend upon it ; mayhap Mr Turnbull , or whoever gave it to him , told him to hold his tongue . ''
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 28]: But this answer would not satisfy Mrs Beazeley , who declared she would not allow a farthing to be taken unless she knew how it was obtained .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 18]: `` Tom , give back the money directly , '' said she , looking at me suspiciously .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 14]: Tom laid it on the table before me , without saying a word .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 13]: `` Take it , Tom , '' said I , colouring up .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 9]: `` I had it from my mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 8]: `` From your mother , Jacob ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 4]: said old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 16]: `` Nay , that could not well be , if my memory sarves me right .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 6]: Still it may be . ''
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 29]: `` Deary me , I do n't like this at all , '' cried Mrs Beazeley , getting up , and wiping her apron with a quick motion .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 14]: `` Oh , Jacob , that must be -- not the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 15]: I coloured up to the tips of my ears at being suspected of falsehood .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 32]: I looked round , and saw that even Tom and his father had a melancholy doubt in their countenances ; and certainly my confused appearance would have caused suspicion in anybody .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 50]: `` I little thought , '' said I , at last , `` when I hoped to have so much pleasure in giving , and to find that I had made you happy in receiving the money , that it would have proved a source of so much annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 20]: I perceive that I am suspected of having obtained it improperly , and of not having told the truth .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 59]: That Mrs Beazeley may think so , who does not know me , is not to be wondered at ; but that you , '' continued I , turning to old Tom , `` or you , '' looking at his son , `` should suspect me , is very mortifying ; and I did not expect it .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 18]: I tell you that the money is mine , honestly mine , and obtained from my mother .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 10]: I ask you , do you believe me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 24]: `` I , for one , do believe you , Jacob , '' said young Tom , striking his fist on the table .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 28]: `` I ca n't understand it , but I know you never told a lie , or did a dishonourable act since I 've known you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 15]: `` Thank you , Tom , '' said I , taking his proffered hand .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 109]: `` And I would swear the same , Jacob , '' said old Tom ; `` although I have been longer in the world than my boy has , and have , therefore , seen more ; and sorry am I to say , many a good man turned bad , from temptation being too great ; but when I looked in your face , and saw the blood up to your forehead , I did feel a little suspicious , I must own ; but I beg your pardon , Jacob ; no one can look in your face now and not see that you are innocent .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 28]: I believe all you say , in spite of the old woman and -- the devil to boot -- and there 's my hand upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 10]: `` Why not tell -- why not tell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 17]: muttered Mrs Beazeley , shaking her head , and working at her net faster than ever .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 23]: But I had resolved to tell , and did so , narrating distinctly the circumstances by which the money had been obtained .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 16]: I did it , however , with feelings of mortification which I can not express .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 20]: I felt humiliation -- I felt that , for my own wants , that money I never could touch .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 20]: Still my explanation had the effect of removing the doubts even of Mrs Beazeley , and harmony was restored .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 19]: The money was accepted by the old couple , and promised to be applied for the purpose intended .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 25]: `` As for me , Jacob , '' said Tom , `` when I say I thank you , you know I mean it .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 29]: Had I had the money , and you had wanted it , you will believe me when I say that I would have given it to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 10]: `` That I 'm sure of , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 63]: `` Still , Jacob , it is a great deal of money , and I shall lay by my earnings as fast as I can , that you may have it in case you want it ; but it will take many a heavy pull and many a shirt wet with labour before I can make up a sum like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 54]: I did not stay much longer after this little fracas ; I was hurt -- my pride was wounded by suspicion , and fortunate it was that the occurrence had not taken place previous to my meeting with Mrs Drummond and Sarah , otherwise no reconciliation would have taken place in that quarter .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 21]: How much are we the sport of circumstances , and how insensibly they mark out our career in this world ?
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 40]: With the best intentions we go wrong ; instigated by unworthy motives , we fall upon our feet , and the chapter of accidents has more power over the best regulated mind than all the chapters in the Bible .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 30]: HOW I WAS REVENGED UPON MY ENEMIES -- WE TRY THE BARS OF MUSIC BUT FIND THAT WE ARE BARRED OUT -- BEING NO GO , WE GO BACK .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 52]: I shook hands with Tom , who perceiving that I was vexed , had accompanied me down to the boat , with his usual sympathy , and had offered to pull with me to Fulham , and walk back ; which offer I declined , as I wished to be alone .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 28]: It was a fine moonlight night , and the broad light and shadow , with the stillness of all around , were peculiarly adapted to my feelings .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 100]: I continued my way up the river , revolving in my mind the scenes of the day ; the reconciliation with one whom I never intended to have spoken to again ; the little quarrel with those whom I never expected to have been at variance with , and that at the time when I was only exerting myself to serve them ; and then I thought of Sarah , as an oasis of real happiness in this contemplated desert , and dwelt upon the thought of her as the most pleasant and calming to my still agitated mind .
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 55]: Thus did I ruminate till I had passed Putney Bridge , forgetting that I was close to my landing place , and continuing , in my reverie , to pull up the river , when my cogitations were disturbed by a noise of men laughing and talking , apparently in a state of intoxication .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 32]: They were in a four-oared wherry , coming down the river , after a party of pleasure , as it is termed , generally one ending in intoxication , I listened .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 31]: `` I tell you I can spin an oar with any man in the king 's service , '' said the man in the bow , `` Now look . ''
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 49]: He threw his oar out of the rowlocks , spun it in the air , but unfortunately did not catch it when it fell , and consequently it went through the bottom , starting two of the planks of the fragile-built boat , which immediately filled with water .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 3]: `` Hilloa !
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 3]: waterman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 15]: cried another , perceiving me , `` quick , or we shall sink . ''
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 30]: But the boat was nearly up to the thwarts in water before I could reach her , and just as I was nearly alongside she filled and turned over .
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 23]: `` Help , waterman ; help me first ; I 'm senior clerk , '' cried a voice which I well knew .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 23]: I put out my oar to him as he struggled in the water , and soon had him clinging to the wherry .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 79]: I then tried to catch hold of the man who had sunk the boat by his attempt to toss the oar , but he very quietly said , `` No , damn it , there 's too many ; we shall swamp the wherry ; I 'll swim on shore '' -- and suiting the action to the word , he made for the shore with perfect self-possession , swimming in his clothes with great ease and dexterity .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 64]: I picked up two more , and thought that all were saved , when turning round , and looking towards the bridge , I saw resplendent in the bright beams of the moon , and `` round as its orb , '' the well-remembered face of the stupid young clerk who had been so inimical to me , struggling with all his might .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 41]: I pulled to him , and putting out my oar over the bow , he seized it after rising from his first sink , and was , with the other three , soon clinging to the side of the wherry .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 12]: `` Pull me in -- pull me in , waterman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 11]: cried the head clerk , whose voice I had recognised .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 10]: `` No ; you will swamp the boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 13]: `` Well , but pull me in , if not the others .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 7]: I 'm the senior clerk . ''
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 30]: `` Ca n't help that ; you must hold on , '' replied I , `` while I pull you on shore ; we shall soon be there . ''
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 18]: I must say that I felt a pleasure in allowing him thus to hang in the water .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 50]: I might have taken them all in certainly , although at some risk , from their want of presence of mind and hurry , arising from the feeling of self-preservation ; but I desired them to hold on , and pulled for the landing-place ; which we soon gained .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 18]: The person who had preferred swimming had arrived before us , and was waiting on the beach .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 10]: `` Have you got them all , waterman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 14]: `` Yes , sir , I believe so ; I have four . ''
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 25]: `` The tally is right , '' replied he , `` and four greater galloots were never picked up ; but never mind that .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 23]: It was my nonsense that nearly drowned them ; and , therefore , I 'm very glad you 've managed so well .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 17]: My jacket went down in the boat , and I must reward you another time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 19]: `` Thank you , sir , no occasion for that , it 's not a regular fare . ''
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 9]: `` Nevertheless , give us your name . ''
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 24]: `` Oh , you may ask Mr Hodgson , the senior clerk , or that full-moon-faced fellow -- they know my name . ''
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 9]: `` Waterman , what do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 8]: replied Mr Hodgson , shivering with cold .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 14]: `` Very impudent fellow , '' said the junior of the round face .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 18]: `` If they know your name , they wo n't tell it , '' replied the other .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 43]: `` Now , I 'll first tell you mine , which is Lieutenant Wilson , of the navy ; and now let 's have yours , that I may ask for it ; and tell me what stairs you ply from . ''
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 37]: `` My name is Jacob Faithful , sir , '' replied I ; `` and you may ask your friends whether they know it or not when their teeth do n't chatter quite so much . ''
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 33]: At the mention of my name the senior and junior clerk walked off , and the lieutenant , telling me that I should hear from him again , was about to leave .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 21]: `` If you mean to give me money , sir , I tell you candidly I shall not take it .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 42]: I hate these two men for the injuries they have heaped on me ; but I do n't know how it is , I feel a degree of pleasure in having saved them , that I wish for no better revenge .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 6]: So farewell , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 14]: `` Spoken as you ought , my lad -- that 's glorious revenge .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 26]: Well , then , I will not come ; but if ever we meet again I shall never forget this night and Jacob Faithful . ''
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 14]: He held out his hand , shook mine warmly , and walked away .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 20]: When they were gone , I remained for some little time quite stupified at the events of the day .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 9]: The reconciliation -- the quarrel -- the revenge .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 16]: I was still in thought when I heard the sound of a horse 's hoofs .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 26]: This recalled me , and I was hauling up my boat , intending to go home to Stapleton 's ; but with no great eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 30]: I felt a sort of dislike to Mary Stapleton , which I could not account for ; but the fact was I had been in company with Sarah Drummond .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 39]: The horse stopped at the foot of the bridge ; and the rider giving it to his servant , who was mounted on another , to hold , came down to where I was hauling up my boat .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 15]: `` My lad , is it too late for you to launch your boat ?
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 7]: I will pay you well . ''
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 11]: `` Where do you wish to go to , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 8]: It is now past ten o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 22]: `` I know it is , and I hardly expected to find a waterman here ; but I took the chance .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 12]: Will you take me about two miles up the river ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 54]: I looked at the person who addressed me , and was delighted to recognise in him the young man who had hired Mr Turnbull and me to take him to the garden , and who had been captured when we escaped with the tin box ; but I did not make myself known .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 37]: `` Well , sir , if you wish it , I 've no objection , '' replied I , putting my shoulder to the bow of my wherry , and launching her again into the water .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 32]: At all events , this has been a day of adventure , thought I , as I threw my sculls again into the water , and commenced pulling up the stream .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 26]: I was some little while in meditation whether I should make myself known to the young man ; but I decided that I would not .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 28]: Let me see , thought I , what sort of a person this is -- whether he is as deserving as the young lady appeared to consider .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 7]: `` Which side , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 11]: inquired I. `` The left , '' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 30]: I knew that well enough , and I pulled in silence until nearly up to the wall of the garden which ran down to the band of the river .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 37]: `` Now pull in to that wall , and make no noise , '' was the injunction ; which I obeyed , securing the boat to the very part where the coping bricks had been displaced .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 45]: He stood up , and whistled the two bars of the tune as before , waited five minutes , repeated it , and watched the windows of the house ; but there was no reply , or signs of anybody being up or stirring .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 13]: `` It is too late ; she is gone to rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 33]: `` I thought there was a lady in the case , sir , '' observed I. `` If you wish to communicate with her , I think I could manage it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 5]: `` Could you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 3]: replied he .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 13]: `` Stop a moment ; I 'll speak to you by-and-by . ''
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 30]: He whistled the tune once more , and after waiting another ten minutes , dropped himself down on the stern sheets , and told me to pull back again .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 22]: After a minute 's silence he said to me , `` You think you could communicate with her , you say .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 8]: Pray , how do you propose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 22]: `` If you will write a letter , sir , I 'll try to let it come to her hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 60]: `` That , sir , you must leave me to find out , and trust to opportunity ; but you must tell me what sort of a person she is , that I may not give it to another ; and also , who there is in the house that I must be careful does not see me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 8]: `` Very true , '' replied he .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 32]: `` I can only say that if you do succeed , I will reward you handsomely ; but she is so strictly watched that I am afraid it will be impossible .
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 30]: However , a despairing , like a drowning man , will catch at a straw ; and I will see whether you will be able to assist me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 76]: He then informed me that there was no one in the house except her uncle and his servants , all of whom were spies upon her ; that my only chance was watching if she were permitted to walk in the garden alone , which might be the case ; and perhaps , by concealing myself from eight o'clock in the morning till the evening under the parapet wall , I might find an opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 33]: He directed me to be at the foot of the bridge next morning at seven o'clock , when he would come with a letter written for me to deliver , if possible .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 7]: We had then arrived at Fulham .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 34]: He landed , and putting a guinea in my hand , mounted his horse , which his servant -LSB- had -RSB- walked up and down , waiting for him , and rode off .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 18]: I hauled up my boat and went home , tired with the manifold events of the day .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 47]: Mary Stapleton who had sat up for me , was very inquisitive to know what had occasioned my coming home so late ; but I evaded her questions , and she left me in anything but good-humour ; but about that I never felt so indifferent .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 31]: The next morning the servant made his appearance with the letter , telling me that he had orders to wait till the evening ; and I pulled up the river .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 45]: I placed it under the loose brick , as agreed upon with the young lady , and then shoved off to the other side of the river , where I had a full view of the garden , and could notice all that passed .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 21]: In half-an-hour the young lady came out , accompanied by another female , and sauntered up and down the gravel-walk .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 18]: After a while she stopped , and looked on the river , her companion continuing her promenade .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 44]: As if without hoping to find anything there , she moved the brick aside with her foot ; perceiving the letter , she snatched it up eagerly , and concealed it in her dress , and then cast her eyes on the river .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 12]: It was calm , and I whistled the bar of music .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 13]: She heard it , and turning away , hastened into the house .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 17]: In about half-an-hour she returned , and watching her opportunity , stooped down to the brick .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 17]: I waited a few minutes , when both she and her companion went into the house .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 72]: I then pulled in under the wall , lifted up the brick , took the letter , and hastened back to Fulham ; when I delivered the letter to the servant , who rode off with it as fast as he could ; and I returned home quite pleased at the successful issue of my attempt , and not a little curious to learn the real facts of this extraordinary affair .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 62]: THE DOMINIE READS ME A SERMON OUT OF THE LARGEST BOOK I EVER FELL IN WITH , COVERING NEARLY TWO ACRES OF GROUND -- THE PAGES NOT VERY EASY TO TURN OVER , BUT THE TYPE VERY CONVENIENT TO READ WITHOUT SPECTACLES -- HE LEAVES OFF WITHOUT SHUTTING HIS BOOK , AS PARSONS USUALLY DO AT THE END OF THEIR SERMONS .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 18]: The next day being Sunday , as usual I went to see the Dominie and Mr Turnbull .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 44]: I arrived at the school just as all the boys were filing off , two and two , for church , the advance led by the usher , and the rear brought up by the Dominie in person , and I accompanied them .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 19]: The Dominie appeared melancholy and out of spirits -- hardly exchanging a word with me during our walk .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 33]: When the service was over he ordered the usher to take the boys home , and remained with me in the churchyard , surveying the tombstones , and occasionally muttering to himself .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 11]: At last the congregation dispersed , and we were alone .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 37]: `` Little did I think , Jacob , '' said he , at last , `` that when I bestowed such care upon thee in thy childhood , I should be rewarded as I have been !
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 48]: Little did I think that it would be to the boy who was left destitute that I should pour out my soul when afflicted , and find in him that sympathy which I have long lost , by the removal of those who were once my friends !
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 75]: Yes , Jacob , those who were known to me in my youth -- those few in whom I confided and leant upon -- are now lying here in crumbling dust , and the generation hath passed away ; and I now rest upon thee , my son , whom I have directed in the right path , and who hast , by the blessing of God , continued to walk straight in it .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 36]: Verily , thou art a solace to me , Jacob ; and though young in years , I feel that in thee I have received a friend , and one that I may confide in .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 5]: Bless thee , Jacob !
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 6]: bless thee , my boy !
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 21]: and before I am laid with those who have gone before me , may I see thee prosperous and happy !
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 29]: Then I will sing the _ Nunc Dimittis _ , then will I say , ` Now , Lord , let thy servant depart in peace . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 48]: `` I am happy , sir , '' replied I , `` to hear you say that I am of any comfort to you , for I feel truly grateful for all your kindness to me ; but I wish that you did not require comfort . ''
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 51]: `` Jacob , in what part of a man 's life does he not require comfort and consolation ; yea , even from the time when , as a child , he buries his weeping face in his mother 's lap till the hour that summons him to his account ?
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 79]: Not that I consider this world to be , as many have described it , a ` vale of tears ' ; No , Jacob ; it is a beautiful world , a glorious world , and would be a happy world , if we would only restrain those senses and those passions with which we have been endowed , that we may fully enjoy the beauty , the variety , the inexhaustible bounty of a gracious heaven .
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 26]: All was made for enjoyment and for happiness ; but it is we ourselves who , by excess , defile that which otherwise were pure .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 39]: Thus , the fainting traveller may drink wholesome and refreshing draughts from the bounteous , overflowing spring ; but should he rush heedlessly into it , he muddies the source , and the waters are those of bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 29]: Thus , Jacob , was wine given to cheer the heart of man ; yet , didst not thou witness me , thy preceptor , debased by intemperance ?
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 73]: Thus , Jacob , were the affections implanted in us as a source of sweetest happiness , such as those which now yearn in my breast towards thee ; yet hast thou seen me , thy preceptor , by yielding to the infatuation and imbecility of threescore years , dote , in my folly , upon a maiden , and turn the sweet affections into a source of misery and anguish . ''
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 26]: I answered not , for the words of the Dominie made a strong impression upon me , and I was weighing them in my mind .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 55]: `` Jacob , '' continued the Dominie , after a pause , `` next to the book of life , there is no subject of contemplation more salutary than the book of death , of which each stone now around us may be considered as a page , and each page contains a lesson .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 8]: Read that which is now before us .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 89]: It would appear hard that an only child should have been torn away from its doting parents , who have thus imperfectly expressed their anguish on the tomb ; it would appear hard that their delight , their solace , the object of their daily care , of their waking thoughts , of their last imperfect recollections as they sank into sleep , of their only dreams , should thus have been taken from them ; yet did I know them , and Heaven was just and merciful .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 23]: The child had weaned them from their God ; they lived but in him ; they were without God in the world .
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 21]: The child alone had their affections , and they had been lost had not He in His mercy removed it .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 7]: Come this way , Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 17]: I followed the Dominie till he stood before another tombstone in the corner of the churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 61]: `` This stone , Jacob , marks the spot where lies the remains of one who was my earliest and dearest friend -- for in my youth I had friends , because I had anticipations , and little thought that it would have pleased God that I should do my duty in that station to which I have been called .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 23]: He had one fault , which proved a source of misery through life , and was the cause of an untimely death .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 7]: He was of a revengeful disposition .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 23]: He never forgave an injury , forgetting , poor , sinful mortal , for how much he had need to be forgiven .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 16]: He quarrelled with his relations ; he was shot in a duel with his friend !
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 51]: I mention this , Jacob , as a lesson to thee ; not that I feel myself worthy to be thy preceptor , for I am humbled , but out of kindness and love towards thee , that I might persuade thee to correct that fault in thy disposition . ''
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 28]: `` I have already made friends with Mr Drummond , sir , '' answered I ; `` but still your admonition shall not be thrown away . ''
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 6]: `` Hast thou , Jacob ?
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 7]: then is my mind much relieved .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 35]: I trust thou wilt no longer stand in thine own light , but accept the offers which , in the fulness of his heart to make redress , he may make unto thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 23]: `` Nay , sir , I can not promise that ; I wish to be independent and earn my own livelihood . ''
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 26]: `` Then hear me , Jacob , for the spirit of prophecy is on me ; the time will come when thou shalt bitterly repent .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 46]: Thou hast received an education by my unworthy endeavours , and hast been blessed by Providence with talents far above the situation in life to which thou wouldst so tenaciously adhere ; the time will come when thou wilt repent , yea , bitterly repent .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 14]: Look at that marble monument with the arms so lavishly emblazoned upon it .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 20]: That , Jacob , is the tomb of a proud man , whose career is well known to me .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 32]: He was in straitened circumstances , yet of gentle race -- but like the steward in the Scripture , ` work he could not , to beg he was ashamed . '
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 14]: He might have prospered in the world , but his pride forbade him .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 12]: He might have made friends , but his pride forbade him .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 22]: He might have wedded himself to wealth and beauty , but there was no escutcheon , and his pride forbade him .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 11]: He did marry , and entail upon his children poverty .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 23]: He died , and the little he possessed was taken from his children 's necessities to build this record to his dust .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 19]: Do not suppose that I would check that honest pride which will prove a safeguard from unworthy actions .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 15]: I only wish to check that undue pride which will mar thy future prospects .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 15]: Jacob , that which thou termest _ independence _ is naught but pride . ''
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 24]: I could not acknowledge that I agreed with the Dominie , although something in my breast told me that he was not wrong .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 5]: I made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 5]: The Dominie again spoke .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 17]: `` Yes ; it is a beautiful world for the Spirit of God is on it .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 23]: At the separation of chaos it came over the water , and hath since remained with us , everywhere , but invisible .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 42]: We see his hand in the variety and the beauty of creation , but his Spirit we see not ; yet do we feel it in the still small voice of conscience , which would lead us into the right path .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 20]: Now , Jacob , we must return , for I have the catechism and collects to attend to . ''
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 30]: I took leave of the Dominie , and went to Mr Turnbull 's , to whom I gave an account of what had passed since I last saw him .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 27]: He was much pleased with my reconciliation with the Drummonds , and interested about the young lady to whom appertained the tin box in his possession .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 16]: `` I presume , Jacob , we shall now have that mystery cleared up . ''
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 46]: `` I have not told the gentleman that we have possession of the box , '' replied I. `` No ; but you told the young lady , you silly fellow ; and do you think she will keep it a secret from him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 10]: `` Very true ; I had forgotten that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 25]: `` Jacob , I wish you to go to Mr Drummond 's and see his family again ; you ought to do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 3]: I hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 46]: `` Nay , I shall give you a fair opportunity without wounding that pride of yours , sir , '' replied Mr Turnbull ; `` I owe him for some wine he purchased for me , and I shall send the cheque by you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 17]: To this I assented , as I was not sorry of an opportunity of seeing Sarah .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 23]: I dined with Mr Turnbull , who was alone , his wife being on a visit to a relation in the country .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 52]: He again offered me his advice as to giving up the profession of a waterman ; but if I did not hear him with so much impatience as before , nor use so many arguments against it , I did not accede to his wishes , and the subject was dropped .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 22]: Mr Turnbull was satisfied that my resistance was weakened , and hoped in time to have the effect that he desired .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 53]: When I went home Mary told me that Tom Beazeley had been there , that his wherry was building , that his father had given up the lighter , and was now on shore very busy in getting up his board to attract customers , and obtain work in his new occupation .
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 23]: I had not launched my wherry the next morning when down came the young gentleman to whom I had despatched the letter .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 24]: `` Faithful , '' said he , `` come to the tavern with me ; I must have some conversation with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 42]: I followed him , and as soon as we were in a room , he said , `` First , let me pay my debt , for I owe you much ; '' and he laid five guineas on the table .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 26]: `` I find from Cecilia that you have possession of the tin case of deeds which has been so eagerly sought after by both parties .
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 7]: Why did you not say so ?
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 24]: And why did you not tell me that it was you whom I hired on the night when I was so unfortunate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 34]: `` I considered the secret as belonging to the young lady , and having told her , I left it to her discretion to make you acquainted or not as she pleased . ''
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 21]: `` It was thoughtful and prudent of you , at all events , although there was no occasion for it .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 18]: Nevertheless , I am pleased that you did so , as it proves you to be trustworthy .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 25]: Now , tell me , who is the gentleman who was with you in the boat , and who has charge of the box ?
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 12]: Observe , Faithful , I do not intend to demand it .
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 34]: I shall tell him the facts of the case in your presence , and then leave him to decide whether he will surrender up the papers to the other party or to me .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 8]: Can you take me there now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 27]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied I , `` I can , if you please ; I will pull you up in half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 10]: The house is at the river 's side . ''
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 19]: The young gentleman leaped into my wherry , and we were soon in the parlour of Mr Turnbull .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 20]: I will not repeat the conversation in detail , but give an outline of the young man 's story .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 74]: A LONG STORY , WHICH ENDS IN THE OPENING OF THE TIN BOX , WHICH PROVES TO CONTAIN DEEDS MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY TO MR. WHARNCLIFFE THAN THE DEEDS OF HIS UNCLE -- BEGIN TO FEEL THE BLESSINGS OF INDEPENDENCE , AND SUSPECT THAT I HAVE ACTED LIKE A FOOL -- AFTER TWO YEARS ' CONSIDERATION , I BECOME QUITE SURE OF IT , AND , AS TOM SAYS , `` NO MISTAKE . ''
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 18]: `` The gentleman who prevented my taking off the young lady is uncle to both of us .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 8]: We are , therefore , first cousins .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 6]: Our family name is Wharncliffe .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 9]: My father was a major in the army .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 21]: He died when I was young , and my mother is still alive , and is sister to Lady Auburn .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 10]: The father and mother of Cecilia are both dead .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 20]: He went out to India to join his brother , another uncle , of whom I shall speak directly .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 36]: He has now been dead three years , and out of the four brothers there is only one left , my uncle ; with whom Cecilia is living , and whose Christian name is Henry .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 19]: He was a lawyer by profession , but he purchased a patent place , which he still enjoys .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 32]: My father , whose name was William , died in very moderate circumstances ; but still he left enough for my mother to live upon , and to educate me properly .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 22]: I was brought up to the law under my uncle Henry , with whom , for some years , I resided .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 46]: Cecilia 's father , whose name was Edward , left nothing ; he had ruined himself in England , and had gone out to India at the request of my uncle there , whose name was James , and who had amassed a large fortune .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 30]: Soon after the death of Cecilia 's father , my uncle James came home on furlough , for he held a very high and lucrative situation under the Company .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 49]: A bachelor from choice , he was still fond of young people ; and having but one nephew and one niece to leave his money to , as soon as he arrived with Cecilia , whom he brought with him , he was most anxious to see me .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 34]: He therefore took up his quarters with my uncle Henry , and remained with him during his sojourn in England ; but my uncle James was of a very cold and capricious temper .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 20]: He liked me best because I was a boy , and one day declared I should be his heir .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 25]: The next day he would alter his intention , and declare that Cecilia , of whom he was very fond , should inherit everything .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 44]: If we affronted him , for at the age of sixteen as a boy , and fourteen as a girl , worldly prospects were little regarded , he would then declare that we should not be a shilling the better for his money .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 34]: With him money was everything : it was his daily theme of conversation , his only passion ; and he valued and respected people in proportion to what they were supposed to possess .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 20]: With these feelings he demanded for himself the greatest deference from Cecilia and me , as his expectant heirs .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 31]: This he did not receive ; but on the whole he was pleased with us , and after remaining three years in England , he returned to the East Indies .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 38]: I had heard him mention to my uncle Henry his intention of making his will , and leaving it with him before he sailed ; but I was not certain whether it had been done or not .
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 40]: At all events , my uncle Henry took care that I should not be in the way ; for at that time my uncle carried on his profession as a lawyer , and I was working in his office .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 25]: It was not until after my uncle James returned to India that he gave up business and purchased the patent place which I mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 29]: Cecilia was left with my uncle Henry , and as we lived in the same house , our affections , as we grew up , ripened into love .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 39]: We often used to laugh at the threats of my uncle James , and agreed that whoever might be the fortunate one to whom he left his property , we would go halves , and share it equally .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 23]: `` In the meantime I still followed up my profession in another house , in which I at present am a partner .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 39]: Four years after the return of my uncle James to India news came home of his death ; but it was also stated that no will could be found , and it was supposed that he died intestate .
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 30]: Of course my uncle Henry succeeded as heir-at-law to the whole property , and thus were the expectations and hopes of Cecilia and of myself dashed to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 125]: But this was not the worst of it : my uncle , who had witnessed our feelings for each other , and had made no comment , as soon as he was in possession of the property , intimated to Cecilia that she should be his heiress , provided that she married according to his wishes ; and pointed out to her that a fortune such as she might expect would warrant the alliance of the first nobleman in the kingdom ; and he very plainly told me that he thought it advisable that I should find lodgings for myself , and not be any longer an inmate in the same house as was my cousin , as no good would result from it .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 27]: Thus , sir , we were not only disappointed in our hopes , but thwarted in our affections , which had for some time been exchanged .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 52]: Maddened at this intimation , I quitted the house ; and at the same time the idea of my uncle James having made a will still pressed upon me , as I called to mind what I had heard him say to my uncle Henry previous to his sailing for India .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 26]: There was a box of deeds and papers , the very box now in your possession , which my uncle invariably kept in his bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 33]: I felt convinced that the will , if not destroyed -LRB- and I did not believe my uncle would dare to commit an act of felony -RRB- , was in that box .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 24]: Had I remained in the house I would have found some means to have opened it ; but this was no longer possible .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 42]: I communicated my suspicions to Cecilia , and begged her to make the attempt , which would be more easy as my uncle would not suspect her of being bold enough to venture it , even if he had the suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 29]: Cecilia promised , and one day my uncle fortunately left his keys upon his dressing-table when he came down to breakfast , and went out without missing them .
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 56]: Cecilia discovered them , and opened the box , and amongst other parchments found a document labelled outside as the will of our uncle James ; but women understand little about these things , and she was in such trepidation for fear that my uncle should return that she could not examine it very minutely .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 26]: As it was , my uncle did return for his keys just as she had locked the box and placed the keys upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 15]: He asked her what she was doing there , and she made some excuse .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 60]: He saw the keys on the table , and whether suspecting her , for she coloured up very much , or afraid that the attempt might be made at my suggestion , he removed the box and locked it up in a closet , the key of which , I believe , he left with his banker in town .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 50]: When Cecilia wrote to me an account of what had passed , I desired her to find the means of opening the closet , that we might gain possession of the box ; and this was easily effected , for the key of another closet fitted the lock exactly .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 35]: I then persuaded her to put herself under my protection , with the determination that we would marry immediately ; and we had so arranged that the tin box was to have accompanied us .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 70]: You are aware , sir , how unfortunately our plan turned out -- at least , so far unfortunately , that I lost , as I thought , not only Cecilia , but the tin box , containing , as I expect , the will of my uncle , of which I am more than ever convinced from the great anxiety shown by my uncle Henry to recover it .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 20]: Since the loss he has been in a state of agitation , which has worn him to a shadow .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 37]: He feels that his only chance is that the waterman employed might have broken open the box , expecting to find money in it , and being disappointed , have destroyed the papers to avoid detection .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 44]: If such had been the case , and it might have been had it not fallen into such good hands , he then would have obtained his only wish , that of the destruction of the will although not by his own hands .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 27]: Now , sir , I have given you a full and honest account of the affair , and leave you to decide how to act . ''
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 20]: `` If you leave me to decide , I shall do it very quickly , '' replied Mr Turnbull .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 19]: `` A box has fallen into my hands , and I do not know who is the owner .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 27]: I shall open it , and take a list of the deeds in contains , and advertise them in the _ Times _ and other newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 50]: If your dead uncle 's will is in it it will , of course , be advertised with the others , and after such publicity your uncle Henry will not venture , I presume , to say a word , but be too glad not to be exposed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 16]: Mr Turnbull ordered a locksmith to be summoned , and the tin box was opened .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 53]: It contained the document of the uncle 's purchase of the patent place in the courts , and some other papers , but it also contained the parchment so much looked after -- the last will and testament of James Wharncliffe , Esquire , dated two months previous to his quitting England .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 30]: `` I think , '' observed Mr Turnbull , `` that in case of accident , it may be as well that this will should be read before witnesses .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 14]: You observe , it is witnessed by Henry Wharncliffe , with two others .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 8]: Let us take down their names . ''
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 15]: The will was read by young Wharncliffe , at the request of Mr Turnbull .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 64]: Strange to say , the deceased bequeathed the whole of his property to his nephew , William Wharncliffe , and his niece , Cecilia , provided they married ; if they did not , they were left 20,000 pounds each , and the remainder of the fortune to go to the first male child born after the marriage of either niece or nephew .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 33]: To his brother the sum of 10,000 pounds was bequeathed , with a liberal arrangement , to be paid out of the estate , so long as his niece lived with him .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 22]: The will was read , and returned to Mr Turnbull , who shook hands with Mr Wharncliffe , and congratulated him .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 32]: `` I am so much indebted to you , sir , that I can hardly express my gratitude , but I am still more indebted to this intelligent lad , Faithful .
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 18]: You must no longer be a waterman , Faithful , '' and Mr Wharncliffe shook my hand .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 35]: I made no answer to the latter observation , for Mr Turnbull had fixed his eye upon me : I merely said that I was very happy to have been of use to him .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 63]: `` You may truly say , Mr Wharncliffe , '' observed Mr Turnbull , `` that your future prosperity will be through his means ; and , as it appears by the will that you have 9000 pounds per annum safe in the Funds , I think you ought to give a prize wherry , to be rowed for every year . ''
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 25]: `` And I will take that , '' replied I , `` for a receipt in full for my share in the transaction . ''
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 42]: `` And now , '' said Mr Turnbull , interrupting Mr Wharncliffe , who was about to answer me , `` it appears to me that it may be as well to avoid any exposure -- the case is too clear .
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 52]: Call upon your uncle -- state in whose hands the documents are -- tell him that he must submit to your terms , which are , that he proves the will , and permits the marriage to take place immediately , and that no more will be said on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 33]: He , as a lawyer , knows how severely and disgracefully he might be punished for what he has done , and will be too happy now to accede to your terms .
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 28]: In the meantime I keep possession of the papers , for the will shall never leave my hands until it is lodged in Doctors ' Commons . ''
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 91]: Mr Wharncliffe could not but approve of this judicious arrangement , and we separated ; and , not to interfere with my narrative , I may as well tell the reader at once that Mr Wharncliffe 's uncle bowed to circumstances , pretended to rejoice at the discovery of the will , never mentioned the loss of his tin box , put the hand of Cecilia into that of William , and they were married one month after the meeting at Mr Turnbull 's , which I have now related .
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 31]: The evening was so far advanced before this council-of-war was over , that I was obliged to defer the delivery of the cheque to Mr Drummond until the next day .
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 24]: I left about eleven o'clock , and arrived at noon ; when I knocked at the door the servant did not know me .
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 7]: `` What did you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 18]: `` I wanted to speak with Mrs or Miss Drummond , and my name is Faithful . ''
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 24]: He desired me to sit down in the hall while he went up ; `` And wipe your shoes , my lad . ''
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 33]: I can not say that I was pleased at this command , as I may call it , but he returned , desiring me to walk up , and I followed him .
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 8]: I found Sarah alone in the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 41]: `` Jacob , I 'm so glad to see you , and I 'm sorry that you were made to wait below , but -- if people who can be otherwise will be watermen , it is not our fault .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 8]: The servants only judge by appearances . ''
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 13]: I felt annoyed for a moment , but it was soon over .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 14]: I sat down by Sarah , and talked with her for some time .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 49]: `` The present I had to make you was a purse of my own knitting , to put your earnings in ; '' said she , laughing ; and then she held up her finger in mockery , crying , `` Boat , sir ; boat , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 24]: Well , Jacob , there 's nothing like independence , after all , and you must not mind my laughing at you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 29]: `` I do not heed it , Sarah , '' replied I ; -LRB- but I did mind it very much -RRB- `` there is no disgrace . ''
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 19]: `` None whatever , I grant ; but a want of ambition , which I can not understand .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 11]: However , let us say no more about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 11]: Mrs Drummond came into the room and greeted me kindly .
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 12]: `` When can you come and dine with us , Jacob ?
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 7]: Will you come on Wednesday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 5]: `` Oh , mamma !
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 15]: He ca n't come on Wednesday ; we have company on that day . ''
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 32]: `` So we have , my dear ; I had forgotten it ; but on Thursday we are quite alone : will you come , then on Thursday , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 38]: I hesitated , for I felt that it was because I was a waterman that I was not admitted to the table where I had been accustomed to dine at one time , whoever might be invited .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 53]: `` Yes , Jacob , '' said Sarah , coming to me , `` it must be Thursday , and you must not deny us ; for although we have greater people on Wednesday , the party that day will not be so agreeable to me as your company on Thursday . ''
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 14]: The last compliment from Sarah decided me , and I accepted the invitation .
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 15]: Mr Drummond came in , and I delivered to him Mr Turnbull 's cheque .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 25]: He was very kind , but said little further than that he was glad that I had promised to dine with them on Thursday .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 24]: The footman came in and announced the carriage at the door , and this was a signal for me to take my leave .
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 80]: Sarah , as she shook hands with me , laughing , asserted that it was not considerate in them to detain me any longer , as I must have lost half-a-dozen good fares already ; `` So go down to your boat , pull off your jacket , and make up for lost time , '' continued she ; `` one of these days mamma and I intend to go on the water , just to patronise you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 12]: I laughed and went away , but I was cruelly mortified .
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 14]: I could not be equal to them , because I was a waterman .
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 28]: The sarcasm of Sarah was not lost upon me ; still there was so much kindness mixed with it that I could not be angry with her .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 33]: On the Thursday I went there , as agreed ; they were quite alone ; friendly and attentive ; but still there was a degree of constraint which communicated itself to me .
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 38]: After dinner Mr Drummond said very little ; there was no renewal of offers to take me into his employ , nor any inquiry as to how I got on in the profession which I had chosen .
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 28]: On the whole , I found myself uncomfortable , and was glad to leave early , nor did I feel at all inclined to renew my visit .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 22]: I ought to remark that Mr Drummond was now moving in a very different sphere than when I first knew him .
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 16]: He was consignee of several large establishments abroad , and was making a rapid fortune .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 21]: His establishment was also on a very different scale , every department being appointed with elegance and conducive to luxury .
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 67]: As I pulled up the river something within my breast told me that the Dominie 's prophecy would turn out correct , and that I should one day repent of my having refused the advances of Mr Drummond -- nay , I did not exactly know whether I did not , even at that moment , very much doubt the wisdom of my asserting my independence .
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 31]: And now , reader , that I may not surfeit you with an uninteresting detail , you may allow nearly two years to pass away before I recommence my narrative .
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 15]: The events of that time I shall sum up in one or two pages .
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 24]: The Dominie continued the even tenor of his way -- blew his nose and handled his rod with as much effect as ever .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 17]: I seldom passed a Sunday without paying him a visit , and benefiting by his counsel .
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 27]: Mr Turnbull was always kind and considerate , but gradually declining in health , having never recovered from the effects of his submersion under the ice .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 42]: Of the Drummonds I saw but little ; when we did meet , I was kindly received , but I never volunteered a call , and it was usually from a message through Tom that I went to pay my respects .
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 41]: Sarah had grown a very beautiful girl , and the well-known fact of Mr Drummond 's wealth , and her being an only daughter , was an introduction to a circle much higher than they had been formerly accustomed to .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 22]: Every day , therefore , the disparity increased , and I felt less inclined to make my appearance at their house .
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 19]: Stapleton , as usual , continued to smoke his pipe and descant upon _ human natur ' _ .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 13]: Mary had grown into a splendid woman , but coquettish as ever .
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 41]: Poor Tom Beazeley was fairly entrapped by her charms , and was a constant attendant upon her , but she played him fast and loose -- one time encouraging and smiling on him , at another rejecting and flouting him .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 36]: Still Tom persevered , for he was fascinated , and having returned me the money advanced for his wherry , he expended all his earnings on dressing himself smartly , and making presents to her .
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 40]: She had completely grown out of any control from me , and appeared to have a pleasure in doing everything she knew I disapproved ; still , we were on fair friendly terms as inmates of the same house .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 50]: Old Tom Beazeley 's board was up , and he had met with great success ; and all day he might be seen hammering at the bottom of boats of every description , and heard , at the same time , lightening his labour with his variety of song .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 35]: I often called there on my way up and down the river , and occasionally passed a few hours listening to his yarns , which , like his songs , appeared to be inexhaustible .
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 17]: With respect to myself , it would be more a narrative of feelings than of action .
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 13]: My life glided on as did my wherry -- silently and rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 17]: One day was but the forerunner of another , with slight variety of incident and customers .
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 17]: My acquaintance , as the reader knows , were but few , and my visits occasional .
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 26]: I again turned to my books during the long summer evenings , in which Mary would walk out , accompanied by Tom and other admirers .
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 14]: Mr Turnbull 's library was at my service , and I profited much .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 20]: After a time reading became almost a passion , and I was seldom without a book in my hand .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 14]: But although I improved my mind , I did not render myself happier .
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 24]: On the contrary , I felt more and more that I had committed an act of egregious folly in thus asserting my independence .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 52]: I felt that I was superior to my station in life , and that I had lived with those who were not companions -- that I had thrown away , by foolish pride , those prospects of advancement which had offered themselves , and that I was passing my youth unprofitably .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 37]: All this crowded upon me more and more every day , and I bitterly repented , as the Dominie told me that I should , my spirit of independence -- now that it was too late .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 69]: The offers of Mr Drummond were never renewed , and Mr Turnbull , who had formed the idea that I was still of the same opinion , and who , at the same time , in his afflicted state -- for he was a martyr to the rheumatism -- naturally thought more of himself and less of others , never again proposed that I should quit my employment .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 57]: I was still too proud to mention my wishes , and thus did I continue plying on the river , apathetic almost as to gain , and only happy when , in the pages of history or among the flowers of poetry , I could dwell upon times that were past , or revel in imagination .
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 63]: Thus did reading , like the snake which is said to contain in its body a remedy for the poison of its fangs , become , as it enlarged my mind , a source of discontent at my humble situation ; but , at the same time , the only solace in my unhappiness , by diverting my thoughts from the present .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 44]: Pass , then , nearly two years , reader , taking the above remarks as an outline , and filling up the picture from the colours of your imagination , with incidents of no peculiar value , and I again resume my narrative .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 84]: A CHAPTER OF LOSSES TO ALL BUT THE READER , THOUGH AT FIRST TOM WORKS WITH HIS WIT , AND RECEIVES THE FULL VALUE OF HIS EXERTIONS -- WE MAKE THE VERY WORST BARGAIN WE EVER MADE IN OUR LIVES -- WE LOSE OUR FARE , WE LOSE OUR BOAT , AND WE LOSE OUR LIBERTY -- ALL LOSS AND NO PROFIT -- FAIR VERY UNFAIR -- TWO GUINEAS WORTH OF ARGUMENT NOT WORTH TWOPENCE , EXCEPT ON THE QUARTER-DECK OF A MAN-OF-WAR .
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 51]: `` Jacob , '' said Tom to me , pulling his wherry into the _ hard _ , alongside of mine , in which I was sitting with one of Mr Turnbull 's books in my hand ; `` Jacob , do you recollect that my time is up to-morrow ?
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 22]: I shall have run off my seven years , and when the sun rises I shall be free of the river .
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 9]: How much more have you to serve ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 14]: `` About fifteen months , as near as I can recollect , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 6]: -- Boat , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 18]: `` Yes ; oars , my lad ; be smart , for I am in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 5]: How 's tide ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 15]: `` Down , sir , very soon ; but it 's now slack water .
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 10]: Tom , see if you can find Stapleton . ''
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 3]: `` Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 12]: never mind him , Jacob , I 'll go with you .
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 29]: I say , Jones , tell old ` _ human natur '_' to look after my boat , '' continued Tom , addressing a waterman of our acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 24]: `` I thought you had come up to see _ her _ , '' said I to Tom , as we shoved off .
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 22]: `` See _ her _ at Jericho first , '' replied Tom `` she 's worse than a dog vane . ''
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 11]: `` What , are you _ two _ again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 14]: `` Two indeed -- it 's all two -- we are two fools .
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 23]: She is too fanciful ; I am too fond ; she behaves too ill , and I put up with too much .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 10]: However , it 's all _ one _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 15]: `` I thought it was all _ two _ just now , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 14]: `` But two may be made one , Jacob , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 14]: `` Yes , by the parson : but you are no parson . ''
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 38]: `` Anyhow , I am something like one just now , '' replied Tom , who was pulling the foremost oar ; `` for you are a good clerk , and I am sitting behind you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 23]: `` That 's not so bad , '' observed the gentleman in the stern-sheets , whom we had forgotten in the colloquy .
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 16]: `` A waterman would make but a bad parson , sir , '' replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 5]: `` Why so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 12]: `` He 's not likely to practice as he preaches . ''
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 7]: `` Again , why so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 14]: `` Because all his life he looks one way and pulls another . ''
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 10]: `` Very good -- very good , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 24]: `` Nay , sir , good in practice , but still not good _ in deed _ -- there 's a puzzle . ''
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 19]: `` A puzzle , indeed , to find such a regular chain of repartee in a wherry . ''
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 23]: `` Well , sir , if I 'm a regular chain to-day , I shall be like an irregular watch to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 8]: `` Why so , my lad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 13]: `` Because I shall be _ out of my time _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 17]: `` Take that , my lad , '' said the gentleman , tossing half-a-crown to Tom .
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 21]: `` Thanky , sir ; when we meet again may you have no more wit than you have now . ''
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 7]: `` How do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 16]: `` Not wit enough to keep your money , sir -- that 's all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 13]: `` I presume you think that I have not got much . ''
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 10]: `` Which , sir ; wit or money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 7]: `` Wit , my lad . ''
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 35]: `` Nay , sir , I think you have both : the first you purchased just now ; and you would hardly have bought it , if you had not money to spare . ''
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 10]: `` But I mean wit of my own . ''
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 41]: `` No man has wit of his own ; if he borrows it , it 's not his own ; if he has it in himself , it 's _ mother _ wit , so it 's not his . ''
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 17]: We pulled into the stairs near London Bridge , and the gentleman paid me his fare .
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 12]: `` Good-bye , my lad , '' said he to Tom .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 27]: `` Fare-you-well , for well you 've paid your fare , '' replied Tom , holding out his arm to assist him out of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 19]: `` Well , Jacob , I 've made more by my head than by my hands this morning .
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 16]: I wonder , in the long run , which gains most in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 16]: `` Head , Tom , depend upon it ; but they work best together . ''
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 22]: Here we were interrupted -- `` I say , you watermen , have you a mind for a good fare ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 24]: cried a dark-looking , not over clean , square-built , short young man , standing on the top of the flight of steps .
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 7]: `` Where to , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 16]: `` Gravesend , my jokers , if you ai n't afraid of salt water . ''
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 28]: `` That 's a long way , sir , '' replied Tom ; `` and for salt water , we must have salt to our porridge . ''
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 18]: `` So you shall , my lads , and a glass of grog into the bargain . ''
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 14]: `` Yes ; but the bargain a 'n' t made yet , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 7]: Jacob , will you go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 10]: `` Yes , but not under a guinea . ''
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 12]: `` Not under two guineas , '' replied Tom , aside .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 11]: `` Are you in a great hurry , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 8]: continued he , addressing the young man .
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 16]: `` Yes , in a devil of a hurry ; I shall lose my ship .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 8]: What will you take me for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 7]: `` Two guineas , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 15]: Just come up to the public-house here , and put in my traps . ''
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 21]: We brought down his luggage , put it into the wherry , and started down the river with the tide .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 46]: Our fare was very communicative , and we found out that he was the master 's mate of the _ Immortalite _ , forty-gun frigate , lying off Gravesend , which was to drop down next morning and wait for sailing orders at the Downs .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 26]: We carried the tide with us , and in the afternoon were close to the frigate , whose blue ensign waved proudly over the taffrail .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 56]: There was a considerable sea arising from the wind meeting the tide , and before we arrived close to her we had shipped a great deal of water ; and when we were alongside , the wherry , with the chest in her bows , pitched so heavily that we were afraid of being swamped .
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 95]: Just as a rope had been made fast to the chest , and they were weighing it out of the wherry , the ship 's launch with water came alongside , and , whether from accident or wilfully , I know not , although I suspect the latter , the midshipman who steered her shot her against the wherry , which was crushed in , and immediately filled , leaving Tom and me in the water , and in danger of being jammed to death between the launch and the side of the frigate .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 39]: The seamen in the boat , however , forced her off with their oars , and hauled us in , while our wherry sank with her gunwale even with the water 's edge , and floated away astern .
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 32]: As soon as we had shaken ourselves a little , we went up the side , and asked one of the officers to send a boat to pick up our wherry .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 16]: `` Speak to the first lieutenant -- there he is , '' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 28]: I went up to the person pointed out to me ; `` If you please , sir -- '' `` What the devil do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 13]: `` A boat , sir , to -- '' `` A boat !
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 6]: the devil you do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 13]: `` To pick up our wherry , sir , '' interrupted Tom .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 21]: `` Pick it up yourself , '' said the first lieutenant , passing us , and hailing the men aloft .
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 10]: `` Maintop , there , hook on your stays .
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 3]: Be smart .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 5]: Lower away the yards .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 7]: Marines and after-guard , clear launch .
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 5]: Boatswain 's mate . ''
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 6]: `` Here , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 10]: `` Pipe marines and after-guard to clear launch . ''
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 8]: `` Aye , aye , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 16]: `` But we shall lose our boat , Jacob , '' said Tom to me .
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 15]: `` They stove it in , and they ought to pick it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 22]: Tom then went up to the master 's mate , which he had brought on board , and explained our difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 13]: `` Upon my soul , I dar 'n' t say a word .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 10]: I 'm in a scrape for breaking my leave .
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 23]: Why the devil did n't you take care of your wherry , and haul a-head when you saw the launch coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 13]: `` How could we , when the chest was hoisting out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 4]: `` Very true .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 18]: Well , I am very sorry for you , but I must look after my chest . ''
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 10]: So saying , he disappeared down the gangway ladder .
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 20]: `` I 'll try it again , anyhow , '' said Tom , going up to the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 20]: `` Hard case to lose our boat and our bread , sir , '' said Tom touching his hat .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 28]: The first lieutenant , now that the marines and after-guard were at a regular stamp and go , had , unfortunately more leisure to attend to us .
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 19]: He looked at us earnestly , and walked aft to see if the wherry was yet in sight .
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 21]: At that moment up came the master 's mate , who had not yet reported himself to the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 29]: `` Tom , '' said I , `` there is a wherry close to , let us get into it , and go after our boat ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 31]: `` Wait one moment to see if they will help us -- and get our money , at all events , '' replied Tom ; and we both walked aft .
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 20]: `` Come on board , sir , '' said the master 's mate , touching his hat with humility .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 34]: `` You 've broke your leave , sir , '' replied the first lieutenant , `` and now I 've to send a boat to pick up the wherry through your carelessness . ''
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 18]: `` If you please , they are two very fine young men , '' observed the mate .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 5]: `` Make capital foretopmen .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 10]: Boat 's not worth sending for , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 21]: This hint , given by the mate to the first lieutenant , to regain his favour , was not lost .
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 9]: `` Who are you , my lads ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 7]: said the first lieutenant to us .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 6]: `` Watermen , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 5]: `` Watermen , heh ?
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 7]: was that your own boat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 21]: `` No , sir , '' replied I ; `` it belongs to the man that I serve with . ''
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 8]: `` Oh , not your own boat ?
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 8]: Are you an apprentice , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 9]: `` Yes , sir , both apprentices . ''
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 7]: `` Show me your indentures . ''
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 11]: `` We do n't carry them about with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 13]: `` Then how am I to know that you are apprentices ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 14]: `` We can prove it , sir , if you wish it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 17]: `` I do wish it ; at all events , the captain will wish it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 12]: `` Will you please to send for the boat , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 8]: she 's almost out of sight . ''
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 18]: `` No , my lads , I ca n't find king 's boats for such service . ''
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 34]: `` Then we had better go ourselves , Tom , '' said I , and we went forward to call the waterman , who was lying on his oars close to the frigate .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 9]: `` Stop -- stop -- not so fast .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 9]: Where are you going , my lads ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 10]: `` To pick up our boat , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 8]: `` Without my leave , heh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 12]: `` We do n't belong to the frigate , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 20]: `` No ; but I think it very likely that you will , for you have no protections . ''
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 16]: `` We can send for them , and have them down by to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 28]: `` Well , you may do so if you please , my lads ; but you can not expect me to believe everything that is told me .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 16]: Now , for instance , how long have you to serve , my lad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 6]: said he , addressing Tom .
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 10]: `` My time is up to-morrow , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 4]: `` Up to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 19]: Why , then , I shall detain you until tomorrow , and then I shall press you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 15]: `` If you detain me now , sir , I am pressed to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 5]: `` Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 15]: you are only detained until you prove your apprenticeship , that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 14]: `` Nay , sir , I certainly am pressed during my apprenticeship . ''
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 13]: `` Not at all , and I 'll prove it to you .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 15]: You do n't belong to the ship until you are victualled on her books .
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 22]: Now I sha 'n' t _ victual _ you to-day , and therefore you wo n't be _ pressed _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 22]: `` I shall be pressed with hunger at all events , '' replied Tom , who never could lose a joke .
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 21]: `` No you sha 'n' t ; for I 'll send you both a good dinner out of the gun-room .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 20]: So you wo n't be pressed at all , '' replied the lieutenant , laughing at Tom 's reply .
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 40]: `` You will allow me to go , sir , at all events , '' replied I ; for I knew that the only chance of getting Tom and myself clear was my hastening to Mr Drummond for assistance .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 3]: `` Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 15]: nonsense ; you must both row in the same boat as you have done .
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 31]: The fact is , my lads , I 've taken a great fancy to you both , and I ca n't make up my mind to part with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 44]: `` It 's hard to lose our bread this way , '' replied I. `` We will find you bread , and hard enough you will find it , '' replied the lieutenant , laughing ; `` it 's like a flint . ''
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 26]: `` So we ask for bread , and you give us a stone , '' said Tom ; `` that 's ` gainst Scripture . ''
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 24]: `` Very true , my lad ; but the fact is , all the scriptures in the world wo n't man the frigate .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 22]: Men we must have , and get them how we can , and where we can , and when we can .
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 16]: Necessity has no law ; at least it obliges us to break through all laws .
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 25]: After all , there 's no great hardship in serving the king for a year or two , and filling your pockets with prize-money .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 5]: Suppose you volunteer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 17]: `` Will you allow us to go on shore for half-an-hour to think about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 5]: replied I. `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 9]: I 'm afraid of the crimps dissuading you .
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 22]: But I 'll give you till to-morrow morning , and then I shall be sure of one at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 9]: `` Thanky for me , '' replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 27]: `` You 're very welcome , '' replied the first lieutenant , as , laughing at us , he went down the companion-ladder to his dinner .
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 22]: `` Well , Jacob , we are in for it , '' said Tom , as soon as we were alone .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 12]: `` Depend upon it there 's no mistake this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 35]: `` I am afraid not , '' replied I , `` unless we can get a letter to your father , or Mr Drummond , who , I am sure , would help us .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 30]: But that dirty fellow , who gave the lieutenant the hint , said the frigate sailed to-morrow morning ; there he is , let us speak to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 8]: `` When does the frigate sail ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 14]: said Tom to the master 's mate , who was walking the deck .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 26]: `` My good fellow , it 's not the custom on board of a man-of-war for men to ask officers to answer such impertinent questions .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 24]: It 's quite sufficient for you to know that when the frigate sails you will have the pleasure of sailing in her . ''
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 29]: `` Well , sir , '' replied I , nettled at his answer , `` at all events you will have the goodness to pay us our fare .
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 25]: We have lost our wherry , and our liberty , perhaps , through you ; we may as well have our two guineas . ''
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 4]: `` Two guineas !
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 10]: It 's two guineas you want , heh . ''
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 14]: `` Yes , sir , that was the fare we agreed upon . ''
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 38]: `` Why you must observe , my men , '' said the master 's mate , hooking a thumb into each armhole of his waistcoat , `` there must be a little explanation as to that affair .
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 23]: I promised you two guineas as watermen ; but now that you belong to a man-of-war , you are no longer watermen .
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 21]: I always pay my debts honourably when I can find the lawful creditors ; but where are the watermen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 7]: `` Here we are sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 21]: `` No , my lads , you are men-of-war 's men now , and that quite alters the case . ''
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 25]: `` But we are not so yet , sir ; even if it did alter the case , we are not pressed yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 19]: `` Well , then , you 'll be to-morrow , perhaps ; at all events we shall see .
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 45]: If you are allowed to go on shore again , I owe you two guineas as watermen ; and if you are detained as men-of-war 's men , why then you will only have done your duty in pulling down one of your officers .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 15]: You see , my lads , I say nothing but what 's fair . ''
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 18]: `` Well , sir , but when you hired us we were watermen , '' replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 32]: `` Very true , so you were ; but recollect the two guineas were not due until you had completed your task , which was not until you came on board .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 15]: When you came on board you were pressed , and became men-of-war 's men .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 16]: You should have asked for your fare before the first lieutenant got hold of you .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 11]: Do n't you perceive the justice of my remarks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 26]: `` Ca n't say I do , sir ; but I perceive there 's very little chance of our being paid , '' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 15]: `` You are a lad of discrimination , '' replied the master 's mate .
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 25]: `` And now I advise you to drop the subject , or you may induce me to pay you ` man-of-war fashion . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 8]: `` How 's that , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 25]: `` Over the face and eyes , as the cat paid the monkey , '' replied the master 's mate , walking leisurely away .
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 18]: `` No go , Tom , '' said I , smiling at the absurdity of the arguments .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 16]: `` I 'm afraid it 's _ no go _ in every way , Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 10]: However , I do n't care much about it .
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 32]: I have had a little hankering after seeing the world , and perhaps now 's as well as an other time ; but I 'm sorry for you , Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 49]: `` It 's all my own fault , '' replied I ; and I fell into one of those reveries so often indulged in of late , as to the folly of my conduct in asserting my independence , which had now ended in my losing my liberty .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 17]: But we were cold from the ducking we had received , and moreover , very hungry .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 36]: The first lieutenant did not forget his promise : he sent us a good dinner , and a glass of grog each , which we discussed under the half-deck , between two of the guns .
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 66]: We had some money in our pockets , and we purchased some sheets of paper from the bum-boat people , who were on the main-deck supplying the seamen , and I wrote to Mr Drummond and Mr Turnbull , as well as to Mary and old Tom , requesting the two latter to forward our clothes to Deal , in case of our being detained .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 28]: Tom also wrote to comfort his mother , and the greatest comfort which he could give was , as he said , to promise to keep sober .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 36]: Having entrusted these letters to the bumboat woman , who promised faithfully to put them into the post-office , we had then nothing else to do but to look out for some place to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 31]: Our clothes had dried on us , and we were walking under the half-deck : but not a soul spoke to , or even took the least notice of us .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 22]: In a newly-manned ship just ready to sail there is a universal feeling of selfishness prevailing among the ship 's company .
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 29]: Some , if not most , had , like us , been pressed , and their thoughts were occupied with their situation and the change in their prospects .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 55]: Others were busy making their little arrangements with their wives or relations ; while the mass of the seamen , not yet organised by discipline or known to each other , were in a state of disunion and individuality , which naturally induced every man to look after himself without caring for his neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 27]: We therefore could not expect , nor did we receive , any sympathy ; we were in a scene of bustle and noise , yet alone .
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 25]: A spare topsail , which had been stowed for the present between two of the guns , was the best accommodation which offered itself .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 21]: We took possession of it , and , tired with exertion of mind and body , were soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 68]: THERE ARE MANY UPS AND DOWNS IN THIS WORLD -- WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE DOWNS -- OUR CAPTAIN COMES ON BOARD , AND GIVES US A SHORT SERMON UPON ANTIPATHIES , WHICH MOST OF US NEVER HEARD THE LIKE OF -- HE SETS US ALL UPON THE GO WITH HIS STOP WATCH , AND NEVER CALLS THE WATCH UNTIL THE WATCH IS SATISFIED WITH ALL HANDS .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 27]: At daylight the next morning we were awakened with a start by the shrill whistles of the boatswain and his mates piping all hands to unmoor .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 12]: The pilot was on board , and the wind was fair .
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 51]: As the frigate had no anchor down , but was hanging to the moorings in the river , we had nothing to do but to cast off , sheet home , and in less than half-an-hour we were under all sail , stemming the last quarter of the flood tide .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 37]: Tom and I had remained on the gangway watching the proceedings but not assisting , when the ship being fairly under sail , the order was given by the first lieutenant to coil down the ropes .
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 32]: `` I think , Jacob , we may as well help , '' said Tom laying hold of the main tack , which was passed aft , and hauling it forward .
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 22]: `` With all my heart , '' replied I , and I hauled it forward , while he coiled it away .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 14]: While we were thus employed the first lieutenant walked forward and recognised us .
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 32]: `` That 's what I like , my lads , '' said he ; `` you do n't sulk , I see , and I sha 'n' t forget it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 49]: `` I hope you wo n't forget that we are apprentices , sir , and allow us to go on shore , '' replied I. `` I 've a shocking bad memory in some things , '' was his reply , as he continued forward to the forecastle .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 39]: He did not , however , forget to victual us that day , and insert our names , in pencil , upon the ship 's books ; but we were not put into any mess , or stationed .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 10]: We anchored in the Downs on the following morning .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 49]: It came on to blow hard in the afternoon , and there was no communication with the shore , except the signal was made , third day , when it moderated , and the signal was made `` Prepare to weigh , and send boat for captain . ''
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 16]: In the meantime several boats came off , and one had a postman on board .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 43]: I had letters from Mr Drummond and Mr Turnbull , telling me that they would immediately apply to the Admiralty for our being liberated , and one from Mary , half of which was for me , and the rest to Tom .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 30]: Stapleton had taken Tom 's wherry and pulled down to old Tom Beazeley with my clothes , which , with young Tom 's , had been despatched to Deal .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 46]: Tom had a letter from his mother , half indited by his father , and the rest from herself ; but I shall not trouble the reader with the contents , as he may imagine what was likely to be said upon such an occasion .
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 43]: Shortly afterwards our clothes , which had been sent to the care of an old shipmate of Tom 's father , were brought on board , and we hardly had received them when the signalman reported that the captain was coming off .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 74]: There were so many of the men in the frigate who had never seen the captain that no little anxiety was shown by the ship 's company to ascertain how far , by the '' _ cut of his jib _ , '' that is , his outward appearance , they might draw conclusions as to what they might expect from one who had such unlimited power to make them happy or miserable .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 51]: I was looking out of the maindeck port with Tom , when the gig pulled alongside , and was about to scrutinise the outward and visible signs of the captain , when I was attracted by the face of a lieutenant sitting by his side , whom I immediately recognised .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 37]: It was Mr Wilson , the officer who had spun the oar and sunk the wherry , from which , as the reader may remember , I rescued my friends , the senior and junior clerk .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 18]: I was overjoyed at this , as I hoped that he would interest himself in our favour .
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 13]: The pipe of the boatswain re-echoed as the captain ascended the side .
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 33]: He appeared on the quarter-deck -- every hat descending to do him honour ; the marines presented arms , and the marine officer at their head lowered the point of his sword .
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 44]: In return , the omnipotent personage , taking his cocked hat with two fingers and a thumb , by the highest peak , lifted it one inch off his head , and replaced it , desiring the marine officer to dismiss the guard .
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 22]: I had now an opportunity , as he paced to and fro with the first lieutenant , to examine his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 31]: He was a tall , very large-boned , gaunt man , with an enormous breadth of shoulders , displaying Herculean strength -LRB- and this we found he eminently possessed -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 50]: His face was of a size corresponding to his large frame ; his features were harsh , his eye piercing , but his nose , although bold , was handsome , and his capacious mouth was furnished with the most splendid row of large teeth that I ever beheld .
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 11]: The character of his countenance was determination rather than severity .
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 8]: When he smiled the expression was agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 17]: His gestures and his language were emphatic , and the planks trembled with his elephantine walk .
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 35]: He had been on board about ten minutes , when he desired the first lieutenant to turn the hands up , and all the men were ordered on the larboard side of the quarter-deck .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 66]: As soon as they were all gathered together , looking with as much awe on the captain as a flock of sheep at a strange , mischief-meaning dog , he thus addressed them -- `` My lads , as it so happens that we are all to trust to the same planks , it may be just as well that we should understand one another .
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 19]: I _ like _ to see my officers attentive to their duty , and behave themselves as gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 16]: I _ like _ to see my men well disciplined , active , and sober .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 15]: What I _ like _ I _ will have _ -- you understand me .
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 33]: Now , '' continued he , putting on a stern look -- `` now , just look in my face , and see if you think you can play with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 27]: The men looked in his face , and saw that there was no chance of playing with him ; and so they expressed by their countenances .
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 32]: The captain appeared satisfied by their mute acknowledgments , and to encourage them , smiled , and showed his white teeth , as he desired the first lieutenant to pipe down .
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 27]: As soon as the scene was over , I walked up to Mr Wilson , the lieutenant , who was standing aft , and accosted him .
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 31]: `` Perhaps , sir , you do not recollect me ; but we met one night when you were sinking in a wherry , and you asked my name . ''
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 18]: `` And I recollect it , my lad ; it was Faithful , was it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 24]: `` Yes , sir ; '' and I then entered into an explanation of our circumstances , and requested his advice and assistance .
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 5]: He shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 15]: `` Our captain , '' said he , `` is a very strange person .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 24]: He has commanding interest , and will do more in defiance of the rules of the Admiralty than any one in the service .
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 27]: If an Admiralty order came down to discharge you , he would obey it ; but as for regulations , he cares very little for them .
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 8]: Besides , we sail in an hour .
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 34]: However , I will speak to him , although I shall probably get a rap on the knuckles , as it is the business of the first lieutenant , and not mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 15]: `` But , sir , if you requested the first lieutenant to speak ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 33]: `` If I did , he would not , in all probability ; men are too valuable , and the first lieutenant knows that the captain would not like to discharge you .
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 25]: He will , therefore , say nothing until it is too late , and then throw all the blame upon himself for forgetting it .
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 25]: Our captain has such interest that his recommendation would give a commander 's rank to-morrow , and we must all take care of ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 16]: However , I will try , although I can give you very little hopes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 40]: Mr Wilson went up to the captain , who was still walking with the first lieutenant , and , touching his hat , introduced the subject , stating , as an apology , that he was acquainted with me .
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 28]: `` Oh , if the man is an acquaintance of yours , Mr Wilson , we certainly must decide , '' replied the captain with mock politeness .
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 6]: `` Where is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 8]: I advanced , and Tom followed me .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 5]: We stated our case .
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 72]: `` I always like to put people out of suspense , '' said the captain , `` because it unsettles a man -- so now hear me ; if I happened to press one of the blood-royal , and the king , and the queen , and all the little princesses were to go down on their knees , I 'd keep him , without an Admiralty order for his discharge .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 12]: Now , my lads , do you perceive your chance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 39]: Then turning away to Mr Wilson , he said , `` You will oblige me by stating upon what grounds you ventured to interfere in behalf of these men , and I trust your explanation will be satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 26]: Mr Knight , '' continued he , to the first lieutenant , `` send these men down below , watch , and station them . ''
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 35]: We went below by the gangway ladder and watched the conference between the captain and Mr Wilson , who , we were afraid , had done himself no good by trying to assist us .
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 20]: But when it was over the captain appeared pleased , and Mr Wilson walked away with a satisfied air .
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 11]: As I afterwards discovered it did me no little good .
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 35]: The hands were piped to dinner , and after dinner we weighed and made sail , and thus were Tom and I fairly , or rather unfairly , embarked in his majesty 's service .
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 16]: `` Well , Tom , '' said I , `` it 's no use crying .
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 24]: What 's done ca n't be helped ; here we are ; now let us do all we can to make friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 9]: `` That 's just my opinion , Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 33]: Hang care ; it killed the cat ; I shall make the best of it , and I do n't see why we may not be as happy here as anywhere else .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 20]: Father says we may , if we do our duty , and I do n't mean to shirk mine .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 23]: The more the merrier , they say , and I 'll be hanged but there 's not enough of us here . ''
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 77]: I hardly need say that , for the first three or four days , we were not very comfortable ; we had been put into the seventh mess , and were stationed in the foretop ; for although we had not been regularly bred up as seaman , the first lieutenant so decided , saying , that he was sure that , in a few weeks , there would be no smarter men in the ship .
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 38]: We were soon clear of the Channel , and all hands were anxious to know our destination , which , in this almost solitary instance , had been really kept a secret , although surmises were correct .
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 72]: There is one point which , by the present arrangements , invariably makes known whether a ship is `` fitting foreign , '' or for home service , which is , by the stores and provisions ordered on board ; and these stores are so arranged , according to the station to which the vessel is bound , that it is generally pretty well known what her destination is to be .
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 44]: This is bad , and at the same time easily remedied ; for if every ship , whether for home service or foreign , was ordered to fit foreign , no one would be able to ascertain where she was about to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 27]: With a very little trouble strict secrecy might be preserved , now that the Navy Board is abolished ; but during its existence that was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 101]: The _ Immortalite _ was a very fast sailing vessel , and when the captain -LRB- whose name I have forgotten to mention , it was Hector Maclean -RRB- opened his sealed orders , we found that we were to cruise for two months between the Western Isles and Madeira , in quest of some privateers , which had captured many of our outward-bound West Indiamen , notwithstanding they were well protected by convoy , and , after that period , to join the admiral at Halifax , and relieve a frigate which had been many years on that station .
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 46]: In a week we were on our station , the weather was fine , and the whole of the day was passed in training the men to the guns , small arms , making and shortening sail , reefing topsails , and manoeuvring the ship .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 27]: The captain would never give up his point , and sometimes we were obliged to make or shorten sail twenty times running until he was satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 56]: `` My lads , '' he would say to the ship 's company , sending for them aft , `` you have done this pretty well ; you have only been two minutes ; not bad for a new ship 's company , but I _ like _ it done in a minute and a-half .
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 6]: We 'll try again . ''
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 18]: And sure enough it was try again , until in a minute and a-half it was accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 32]: Then the captain would say , `` I knew you could do it , and having once done it , my lads , of course you can do it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 9]: Tom and I adhered to our good resolutions .
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 27]: We were as active and as forward as we could be ; and Mr Knight , the first lieutenant , pointed us out to the captain .
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 54]: As soon as the merits of the different men were ascertained , several alterations were made in the watch and station bills , as well as in the ratings on the ship 's books , and Tom and I were made _ second _ captains , larboard and starboard , of the foretop .
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 31]: This was great promotion for so young hands , especially as we were not bred as regular sailors ; but it was for the activity and zeal which we displayed .
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 35]: Tom was a great favourite among the men , always joking , and ready for any lark or nonsense ; moreover , he used to mimic the captain , which few others dared do .
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 30]: He certainly seldom ventured to do it below ; it was generally in the foretop , where he used to explain to the men what he _ liked _ .
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 17]: One day we both ventured it , but it was on an occasion which excused it .
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 38]: Tom and I were aft , sitting in the jolly boat astern , fitting some of her gear , for we belonged to the boat at that time , although we were afterwards shifted into the cutter .
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 18]: The frigate was going about four knots through the water , and the sea was pretty smooth .
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 12]: One of the marines fell overboard , out of the forechains .
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 34]: `` Man overboard , '' was cried out immediately , and the men -LSB- became -RSB- very busy clearing away the starboard cutter , with all the expedition requisite on such an occasion .
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 48]: The captain was standing aft on the signal chest when the marine passed astern ; the poor fellow could not swim , and Tom turning to me said , `` Jacob , I should _ like _ to save that Jolly , '' and immediately dashed overboard .
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 20]: `` And I should _ like _ to help you , Tom , '' cried I , following him .
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 12]: The captain was close to us , and heard us both .
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 23]: Between us we easily held up the marine , and the boat had us all on board in less than a minute .
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 12]: When we came on deck the captain was at the gangway .
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 16]: He showed his white teeth , and shook the telescope in his hand at us .
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 24]: `` I heard you both ; and I should _ like _ to have a good many more impudent fellows like you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 37]: We continued our cruise , looking sharp out for the privateers , but without success ; we then touched at Madeira for intelligence , and were informed that they had been seen more to the southward .
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 47]: The frigate 's head was turned in that direction until we were abreast of the Canary Isles , and then we traversed east and west , north or south , just as the wind and weather , or the captain 's _ like _ thought proper .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 31]: We had now cruised seven weeks out of our time without success , and the captain promised five guineas to the man who should discover the objects of our search .
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 34]: Often did Tom and I climb to the mast-head and scan the horizon , and so did many others : but those who were stationed at the look-out were equally on the alert .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 40]: The ship 's company were now in a very fair state of discipline , owing to the incessant practice , and every evening the hands were turned up to skylark -- that is , to play and amuse themselves .
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 33]: There was one amusement which was the occasion of a great deal of mirth , and it was a favourite one of the captain 's , as it made the men smart .
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 10]: It is called , `` Follow my leader . ''
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 20]: One of the men leads , and all who choose follow him : sometimes forty or fifty will join .
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 18]: Whatever the leader does , the rest must do also ; wherever he goes they must follow .
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 172]: Tom , who was always the foremost for fun , was one day the leader , and after having scampered up the rigging , laid out on the yards , climbed in by the lifts , crossed from mast to mast by the stays , slid down by the backstays , blacked his face in the funnel , in all which motions he was followed by about thirty others , hallooing and laughing , while the officers and other men were looking on and admiring their agility , a novel idea came into Tom 's head ; it was then about seven o'clock in the evening , the ship was lying becalmed , Tom again sprang up the rigging , laid out to the main yard-arm , followed by me and the rest , and as soon as he was at the boom iron , he sprang up , holding by the lift , and crying out , `` Follow my leader , '' leaped from the yard-arm into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 46]: I was second , and crying out , `` Follow my leader '' to the rest , I followed him , and the others , whether they could swim or not , did the same , it being a point of honour not to refuse .
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 61]: The captain was just coming up the ladder , when he saw , as he imagined , a man tumble overboard , which was Tom in his descent ; but how much more was he astonished at seeing twenty or thirty more tumbling off by twos or threes , until it appeared that half the ship 's company were overboard .
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 22]: Some of the men who could not swim , but were too proud to refuse to follow , were nearly drowned .
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 26]: As it was , the first lieutenant was obliged to lower the cutter to pick them up , and they were all brought on board .
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 25]: `` Confound that fellow , '' said the captain to the first lieutenant ; `` he is always at the head of all mischief .
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 6]: Follow my leader , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 6]: Send Tom Beazeley here . ''
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 11]: We all thought that Tom was about to catch it .
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 29]: `` Hark ye , my lad , '' said the captain ; `` a joke 's a joke , but everybody ca n't swim as well as you .
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 30]: I ca n't afford to lose any of my men by your pranks , so do n't try that again -- I do n't _ like _ it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 71]: Every one thought that Tom got off very cheaply ; but he was a favourite with the captain , although that never appeared but indirectly ; `` Beg pardon , sir , '' replied Tom , with great apparent humility , `` but they were all so dirty -- they 'd blacked themselves at the funnel , and I thought a little washing would not do them any harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 27]: `` Be off , sir , and recollect what I have said , '' replied the captain , turning away , and showing his white teeth .
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 23]: I heard the first lieutenant say to the captain , `` He 's worth any ten men in the ship , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 15]: He keeps them all alive and merry , sets such a good example . ''
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY NINE .
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 62]: `` TO BE , OR NOT TO BE , '' THAT IS THE QUESTION -- SPLINTERS ON BOARD OF A MAN-OF-WAR VERY DIFFERENT FROM SPLINTERS IN THE FINGER ON SHORE -- TOM PREVENTS THIS NARRATIVE FROM BEING WOUND UP BY MY GOING DOWN -- I RECEIVE A LAWYER 'S LETTER , AND INSTEAD OF BEING ANNOYED , AM DELIGHTED WITH IT .
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 39]: In the meantime , Tom had gone up to the fore-royal arm , and was looking round for the five guineas , and just as the conversation was going on , cried out , `` Sail ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 6]: `` Strange sail reported . ''
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 12]: `` Where , '' cried the first lieutenant , going forward .
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 7]: `` Right under the sun . ''
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 11]: `` Mast-head there -- do you make her out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 23]: `` Yes , sir ; I think she 's a schooner ; but I can only see down to her mainyard . ''
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 16]: `` That 's one of them , depend upon it , '' said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 15]: `` Up there , Mr Wilson , and see what you make of her .
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 9]: Who is the man who reported it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 7]: `` Tom Beazeley , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 24]: `` Confound that fellow , he makes all my ship 's company jump overboard , and now I must give him five guineas .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 11]: What do you make of her , Mr Wilson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 14]: `` A low schooner , sir , very rakish indeed , black sides .
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 22]: I can not make out her ports ; but I should think she can show a very pretty set of teeth .
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 9]: She is becalmed as well as we . ''
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 12]: `` Well , then , we must whistle for a breeze .
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 16]: In the meantime , Mr Knight , we will have the boats all ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 12]: If you whistle long enough the wind is certain to come .
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 41]: In about an hour the breeze did come , and we took it down with us ; but it was too dark to distinguish the schooner , which we had lost sight of as soon as the sun had set .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 13]: About midnight the breeze failed us , and it was again calm .
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 23]: The captain and most of the officers were up all night , and the watch were employed preparing the boats for service .
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 26]: It was my morning watch , and at break of day I saw the schooner from the foresail-yard about four miles to the North West .
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 9]: I ran down on deck and reported her .
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 7]: `` Very good , my lad .
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 36]: I have her , Mr Knight , '' said the captain , who had directed his glass to where I pointed ; `` and I will have her too , one way or the other .
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 5]: No signs of wind .
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 5]: Lower down the cutters .
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 9]: Get the yards and stays hooked all ready .
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 20]: We 'll wait a little , and see a little more of her when it 's broad daylight . ''
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 17]: At broad daylight the schooner , with her appointments , was distinctly to be made out .
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 18]: She was pierced for sixteen guns , and was a formidable vessel to encounter with the boats .
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 21]: The calm still continuing , the launch , yawl , and pinnace were hoisted out , manned , and armed .
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 15]: The schooner got out her sweeps , and was evidently preparing for their reception .
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 38]: Still the captain appeared unwilling to risk the lives of his men in such a dangerous conflict , and there we all lay alongside , each man sitting in his place with his oar raised on end .
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 45]: Cat 's - paws of wind , as they call them , flew across the water here and there , ruffling its smooth surface , portending that a breeze would soon spring up , and the hopes of this chance rendered the captain undecided .
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 42]: Thus did we remain alongside , for Tom and I were stationed in the first and second cutters until twelve o'clock , when we were ordered out to take a hasty dinner , and the allowance of spirits was served out .
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 7]: At one it was still calm .
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 19]: Had we started when the boats were first hoisted out the affair would have been long before decided .
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 29]: At last , the captain , perceiving that the chance of a breeze was still smaller then than in the forenoon , ordered the boats to shove off .
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 17]: We were still about the same distance from the privateer , from three-and-a-half to four miles .
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 31]: In less than half-an-hour we were within gun-shot ; the privateer swept her broadside to us , and commenced firing guns with single round shot , and with great precision .
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 20]: They _ ricochetted _ over the boats , and at every shot we made sure of our being struck .
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 11]: At this time a slight breeze swept along the water .
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 15]: It reached the schooner , filled her sails , and she increased her distance .
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 11]: Again it died away , and we neared her fast .
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 40]: She swept round again , and recommenced firing , and one of her shot passed through the second cutter , in which I was stationed , ripping open three of her planks , and wounding two men beside me .
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 41]: The boat , heavy with the gun , ammunition chests , etcetera , immediately filled and turned over with us , and it was with difficulty that we could escape from the weighty hamper that was poured out of her .
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 23]: One of the poor fellows , who had not been wounded , remained entangled under the boat , and never rose again .
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 18]: The remainder of the crew rose to the surface and clung to the side of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 75]: The first cutter hauled to our assistance , for we had separated to render the shot less effectual ; but it was three or four minutes before she was able to render us any assistance , during which time the other two wounded men , who had been apparently injured in the legs or body , exhausted with loss of blood , gradually unloosed their holds and disappeared under the calm , blue water .
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 33]: I had received a splinter in my left arm , and held on longer than the others who had been maimed , but I could not hold on till the cutter came .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 8]: I lost my recollection , and sank .
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 35]: Tom , who was in the bow of the cutter , perceiving me go down , dived after me , brought me up again to the surface , and we were both hauled in .
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 8]: The other five men were also saved .
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 23]: As soon as we were picked up , the cutter followed the other boats , which continued to advance towards the privateer .
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 44]: I recovered my senses , and found that a piece of one of the thwarts of the boat , broken off by the shot , had been forced through the fleshy part of my arm below the elbow , where it still remained .
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 12]: It was a very dangerous as well as a painful wound .
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 48]: The officer of the boat , without asking me , laid hold of the splinter and tore it out ; but the pain was so great , from its jagged form , and the effusion of blood so excessive after this operation , that I again fainted .
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 14]: Fortunately no artery was wounded , or I must have lost my arm .
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 15]: They bound it up , and laid me at the bottom of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 36]: The firing from the schooner was now very warm ; and we were within a quarter of a mile of her , when the breeze sprang up , and she increased her distance a mile .
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 24]: There was a prospect of wind from the appearance of the sky , although , for a time , it again died away .
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 31]: We were within less than half-a-mile of the privateer , when we perceived that the frigate was bringing up a smart breeze , and rapidly approached the scene of conflict .
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 56]: The breeze swept along the water and caught the sails of the privateer , and she was again , in spite of all the exertions of our wearied men , out of gun-shot ; and the first lieutenant very properly decided upon making for the frigate , which was now within a mile of us .
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 48]: In less than ten minutes the boats were hoisted in ; and the wind now rising fast , we were under all sail , going at the rate of seven miles an hour ; the privateer having also gained the breeze , and gallantly holding her own .
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 16]: I was taken down into the cockpit , the only wounded man brought on board .
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 33]: The surgeon examined my arm , and at first shook his head , and I expected immediate amputation ; but on re-examination he gave his opinion that the limb might be saved .
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 33]: My wound was dressed , and I was put into my hammock , in a screened bulk under the half-deck , where the cooling breeze from the ports fanned my feverish cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 8]: But I must return to the chase .
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 39]: In less than an hour the wind had increased , so that we could with difficulty carry our royals ; the privateer was holding her own about three miles right a-head , keeping our three masts in one .
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 22]: At sunset they were forced to take in the royals , and the sky gave every prospect of a rough gale .
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 29]: Still we carried on every stitch of canvas which the frigate could bear ; keeping the chase in sight with our night-glasses , and watching all her motions .
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 24]: The breeze increased ; before morning there was a heavy sea , and the frigate could only carry top-gallant sails over double-reefed top-sails .
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 42]: At daylight we had neared the schooner , by the sextants , about a quarter of a mile , and the captain and officers went down to take some repose and refreshment , not having quitted the deck for twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 84]: All that day did we chase the privateer , without gaining more than a mile upon her , and it now blew up a furious gale : the topgallant sails had been before taken in ; the top-sails were close reefed , and we were running at the speed of nearly twelve miles an hour ; still so well did the privateer sail , that she was barely within gunshot when the sun went down below the horizon , angry and fiery red .
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 44]: There was now great fear that she would escape , from the difficulty of keeping the glasses upon her during the night , in a heavy sea , and the expectation that she would furl all sail and allow us to pass her .
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 74]: It appeared , however , that this manoeuvre did not enter into the head of the captain of the privateer ; he stood on under a press of sail , which even in day-time would have been considered alarming ; and at daylight , owing to the steerage during the night never being so correct as during the day , she had recovered her distance , and was about four miles from us .
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 25]: The gale , if anything , had increased , and Captain Maclean determined , notwithstanding , to shake a reef out of the topsails .
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 20]: In the morning , as usual , Tom came to my cot , and asked me how I was ?
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 39]: I told him I was better and in less pain , and that the surgeon had promised to dress my wound after breakfast , for the bandages had not been removed since I had first come on board .
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 27]: `` And the privateer , Tom , I hope we shall take her ; it will be some comfort to me that she is captured . ''
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 56]: `` I think we shall , if the masts stand , Jacob ; but we have an enormous press of sail , as you may guess by the way in which the frigate jumps ; there is no standing on the forecastle , and there is a regular waterfall down in the waist from forward .
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 6]: We are nearing her now .
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 50]: It is beautiful to see how she behaves : when she heels over , we can perceive that all her men are lashed on deck , and she takes whole seas into her fore and aft mainsail , and pours them out again as she rises from the lurch .
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 10]: She deserves to escape , at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 25]: She did not , however , obtain her deserts , for about twelve o'clock in the day we were within a mile of her .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 32]: At two , the marines were firing small arms at her , for we would not yaw to fire at her a gun , although she was right under our bows .
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 43]: When within a cable 's length we shortened sail , so as to keep at that distance astern , and the chase , after having lost several men by musketry , the captain of her waved his hat in token of surrender .
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 41]: We immediately shortened sail to keep the weather-gage , pelting her until every sail was lowered down : we then rounded to , keeping her under our lee , and firing at every man who made his appearance on deck .
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 54]: Taking possession of her was a difficult task : a boat could hardly live in such a sea and when the captain called aloud for volunteers , and I heard Tom 's voice in the cutter as it was lowering down , my heart misgave me lest he should meet with some accident .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 26]: At last I knew , from the conversation on deck , that the cutter had got safe on board , and my mind was relieved .
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 21]: The surgeon came up and dressed my arm , and I then received comparative bodily as well as mental relief .
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 44]: It was not until the next day , when we lay to , with the schooner close to us , that the weather became sufficiently moderate to enable us to receive the prisoners , and put our own men and officers on board .
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 16]: The prize proved to be an American-built schooner , fitted out as a French privateer .
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 39]: She was called the _ Cerf Agile _ , mounting fourteen guns , of nearly three hundred tons measurement , and with a crew of one hundred and seventy men , of which forty-eight were away in prizes .
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 24]: It was perhaps fortunate that the boats were not able to attack her , as they would have received a very warm reception .
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 20]: Thus did we succeed in capturing this mischievous vessel , after a chase of two hundred and seventy miles .
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 31]: As soon as all the arrangements were made , we shaped our course , with the privateer in company , for Halifax , where we arrived in about five weeks .
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 24]: My wound was now nearly healed , but my arm had wasted away , and I was unable to return to my duty .
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 37]: It was well known that I wrote a good hand , and I volunteered , as I could do nothing else , to assist the purser and the clerk with the ship 's books , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 39]: The admiral was at Bermuda , and the frigate which we were to relieve had , from the exigence of the service , been despatched down to the Honduras , and was not expected back for some months .
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 23]: We sailed from Halifax to Bermuda , and joined the admiral , and after three weeks we were ordered on a cruise .
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 52]: My arm was now perfectly recovered , but I had become so useful in the clerk 's office that I was retained , much against my own wishes : but the captain _ liked _ it , as Tom said and after that there was no more said about the matter .
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 33]: America was not the seat of war at that period ; and , with the exception of chasing French runners , there was nothing to be done on the North American station .
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 22]: I have , therefore , little to narrate during the remainder of the time that I was on board the frigate .
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 86]: Tom did his duty in the foretop , and never was in any disgrace ; on the contrary , he was a great favourite both with officers and men , and took more liberties with the captain than any one else dared to have done ; but Captain Maclean knew that Tom was one of his foremost and best men , always active , zealous , and indifferent as to danger , and Tom knew exactly how far he could venture to play with him .
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 46]: I remained in the clerk 's office , and as it was soon discovered that I had received an excellent education , and always behaved myself respectfully to my superiors , I was kindly treated , and had no reason to complain of a man-of-war .
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 45]: Such was the state of affairs when the other frigate arrived from the Honduras , and we , who had been cruising for the last four months in Boston Bay , were ordered in by a cutter , to join the admiral at Halifax .
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 14]: We had now been nearly a year from England without receiving any letters .
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 44]: The reader may , therefore , judge of my impatience when , after the anchor had been let go and the sails furled , the admiral 's boat came on board with several bags of letters for the officers and ship 's company .
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 19]: They were handed down into the gun-room , and I waited with impatience for the sorting and distribution .
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 17]: `` Faithful , '' said the purser , `` here are two letters for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 20]: I thanked him , and hastened into the clerk 's office , that I might read them without interruption .
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 13]: The first was addressed in a formal hand quite unknown to me .
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 20]: I opened it with some degree of wonderment as to who could possibly write to so humble an individual !
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 32]: It was from a lawyer , and the contents were as follows : -- Sir -- We hasten to advise you of the death of your good friend Mr Alexander Turnbull .
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 53]: By his will , which has been opened and read , and of which you are the executor , he has made you his sole heir , bequeathing you , at the present , the sum of 30,000 pounds , with the remainder of his fortune at the demise of his wife .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 26]: With the exception of 5000 pounds left to Mrs Turnbull for her own disposal , the legacies do not amount to more than 800 pounds .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 55]: The jointure arising from the interest of the money secured to Mrs Turnbull during her life is 1080 pounds per annum , upon the three per cent , consols , so that at her demise you will come into 36,000 pounds consols , which at 76 , will be equal to 27,360 pounds sterling .
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 26]: I beg to congratulate you upon your good fortune , and , with Mr Drummond , have made application to the Admiralty for your discharge .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 36]: This application , I am happy to say , has been immediately attended to , and by the same mail that conveys this letter is forwarded an order for your discharge and a passage home .
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 25]: Should you think proper to treat our firm as your legal advisers , we shall be most happy to enrol you among our clients .
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 12]: I am , sir , yours very respectfully , JOHN FLETCHER .
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 14]: I must leave the reader to judge of this unexpected and welcome communication .
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 63]: At first I was so stunned that I appeared as a statue , with the letter in my hand , and in this condition I remained until roused by the first lieutenant , who had come to the office to desire me to pass the word for `` letters for England , '' and to desire the sail-maker to make a bag .
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 9]: `` Faithful -- why what 's the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 8]: Are you ill , or -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 14]: I could not reply , but I put the letter into his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 12]: He read the contents , expressed his astonishment by occasional exclamations .
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 18]: `` I wish you joy , my lad , and may it be my turn next time .
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 9]: No wonder you looked like a stuck pig .
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 29]: Had I received such news the captain might have hallooed till he was hoarse , and the ship might have tumbled overboard before I should have roused myself .
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 35]: Well , I suppose we shall get no more work out of you -- '' `` The captain wants you , Mr Knight , '' said one of the midshipmen , touching his hat .
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 24]: Mr Knight went into the cabin , and in a few minutes returned , holding the order for my discharge in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 22]: `` It 's all right , Faithful , here is your discharge , and an order for your passage home . ''
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 24]: He laid it on the table , and then went away , for a first lieutenant in harbour has no time to lose .
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 24]: The next person who came was Tom , holding in his hand a letter from Mary , with a postscript from his mother .
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 17]: `` Well , Jacob , '' said he , `` I have news to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 31]: Mary says that Mr Turnbull is dead , and has left her father 200 pounds , and that she has been told that he has left you something handsome . ''
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 17]: `` He has indeed , Tom , '' replied I ; `` read this letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 18]: While Tom was reading , I perceived the letter from Mr Drummond , which I had forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 4]: I opened it .
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 45]: It communicated the same intelligence as that of the lawyer , in fewer words ; recommended my immediate return , and enclosed a bill upon his house for 100 pounds , to enable me to appear in a manner corresponding to my present condition .
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 18]: `` Well , '' said Tom , `` this is , indeed , good news , Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 13]: You are a gentleman at last , as you deserve to be .
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 15]: It has made me so happy ; what do you mean to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 20]: `` I have my discharge here , '' replied I , `` and am ordered a passage home . ''
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 4]: `` Better still .
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 10]: I am so happy , Jacob ; so happy .
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 11]: But what _ is _ to become of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 17]: And Tom passed the back of his hand across his eyes to brush away a tear .
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 22]: `` You shall soon follow me , Tom , if I can manage it either by money or any influence . ''
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 13]: `` I will manage it , if you do n't , Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 14]: I wo n't stay here without you , that I am determined . ''
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 7]: `` Do nothing rashly , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 28]: I am sure I can buy your discharge , and on my arrival in England I will not think of anything else until it is done . ''
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 22]: `` You must be quick , then , Jacob , for I 'm sure I ca n't stay here long . ''
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 23]: `` Trust to me , Tom ; you 'll still find me Jacob Faithful , '' said I , extending my hand .
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 17]: Tom squeezed it earnestly , and with moistened eyes , turned away , and walked forward .
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 25]: The news had spread through the ship , and many of the officers , as well as the men , came to congratulate me .
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 51]: What would I have given to have been allowed only one half-hour to myself -- one half-hour in which I might be permitted to compose my excited feelings -- to have returned thanks for such unexpected happiness , and paid a tribute to the memory of so sincere a friend ?
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 54]: But in a ship this is almost impossible , unless , as an officer , you can retreat to your own cabin ; and those gushings from the heart , arising from grief or pleasure , the tears so sweet in solitude , must be prostituted before the crowd , or altogether repressed .
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 8]: At last the wished-for opportunity did come .
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 61]: Mr Wilson , who had been away on service , came to congratulate me as soon as he heard the news , and with an instinctive perception of what might be my feelings , asked me whether I would not like to write my letters in his cabin , which , for a few hours , was at my service .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 27]: I thankfully accepted the offer ; and , when summoned by the captain , had relieved my overcharged heart , and had composed my excited feelings .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 21]: `` Jacob Faithful , you are aware there is an order for your discharge , '' said he , kindly .
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 28]: `` You will be discharged this afternoon into the _ Astrea _ ; she is ordered home , and will sail with despatches in a few days .
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 69]: You have conducted yourself well since you have been under my command ; and , although you are now in a situation not to require a good certificate , still you will have the satisfaction of feeling that you have done your duty in the station of life to which you have , for a certain portion of it , been called -- I wish you well . ''
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 49]: Although Captain Maclean , in what he said , never lost sight of the relative situations in which we had been placed , there was a kindness of manner , especially in the last words , `` I wish you well , '' which went to my heart .
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 26]: I replied that I had been very happy during the time I had been under his command , and thanked him for his good wishes .
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 8]: I then bowed and left the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 21]: But the captain did not send me on board the _ Astrea _ , although I was discharged into her .
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 93]: He told the first lieutenant that I had better go on shore , and equip myself in a proper manner ; and as I afterwards found out , spoke of me in very favourable terms to the captain of the _ Astrea _ , acknowledging that I had received the education of a gentleman , and had been illegally impressed ; so that , when I made my appearance on board the _ Astrea _ , the officers of the gun-room requested that I would mess with them during the passage home .
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 40]: I went on shore , obtained the money for my bill , hastened to a tailor , and with his exertions , and other fitting-out people , procured all that was requisite for the outward appearance of a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 25]: I then returned to the _ Immortalite _ , and bade farewell to the officers and seamen with whom I had been most intimate .
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 7]: My parting with Tom was painful .
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 21]: Even the few days which I had been away , I perceived , had made an alteration in his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 67]: `` Jacob , '' said he , `` do n't think I envy you ; on the contrary , I am as grateful , even more grateful than if such good fortune had fallen to my own lot ; but I can not help fretting at the thought of being left here without you : and I shall fret until I am with you again . ''
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 35]: I renewed my promises to procure his discharge , and forcing upon him all the money I thought that I could spare , I went over the side as much affected as poor Tom .
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 6]: Our passage home was rapid .
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 28]: We had a continuance of North West winds , and we flew before them , and in less than three weeks we dropped our anchor at Spithead .
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 60]: Happy in the change of my situation , and happier still in anticipation , I shall only say that I never was in better spirits , or in company with more agreeable young men than were the officers of the _ Astrea _ ; and although we were so short a time together , we separated with mutual regret .
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 3]: CHAPTER FORTY .
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 45]: I INTERRUPT A MATRIMONIAL DUET AND CAPSIZE THE BOAT -- BEING UPON DRY LAND , NO ONE IS DROWNED -- TOM LEAVES A MAN-OF-WAR BECAUSE HE DO N'T LIKE IT -- I FIND THE PROFESSION OF A GENTLEMAN PREFERABLE TO THAT OF A WATERMAN .
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 22]: My first object on my return was to call upon old Tom , and assure him of his son 's welfare .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 25]: My wishes certainly would have led me to Mr Drummond 's but I felt that my duty required that I should delay that pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 38]: I arrived at the hotel late in the evening , and early next morning I went down to the steps at Westminster Bridge , and was saluted with the usual cry of `` Boat , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 48]: A crowd of recollections poured into my mind at the well-known sound ; my life appeared to have passed in review in a few seconds , as I took my seat in the stern of a wherry , and directed the waterman to pull up the river .
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 72]: It was a beautiful morning , and even at that early hour almost too warm -- the sun was so powerful ; I watched every object that we passed with an interest I can not describe ; every tree , every building , every point of land -- they were all old friends , who appeared , as the sun shone brightly on them , to rejoice in my good fortune .
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 50]: I remained in a reverie too delightful to be wished to be disturbed from it , although occasionally there were reminiscences which were painful ; but they were but as light clouds , obscuring for a moment , as they flew past , the glorious sun of my happiness .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 44]: At last the well-known tenement of old Tom , his large board with `` Boats built to order , '' and the half of the boat stuck up on end , caught my sight , and I remembered the object of my embarkation .
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 62]: I directed the waterman to pull to the hard , and , paying him well , dismissed him ; for I had perceived that old Tom was at work stumping round a wherry , bottom up ; and his wife was sitting on a bench in the boat-arbour , basking in the warm sun , and working away at her nets .
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 35]: I had landed so quietly , and they both were so occupied with their respective employments , that they had not perceived me , and I crept round by the house to surprise them .
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 16]: I had gained a station behind the old boat , where I overheard the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 33]: `` It 's my opinion , '' said old Tom , who left off hammering for a time , `` that all the nails in Birmingham wo n't make this boat water-tight .
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 16]: The timbers are as rotten as a pear , and the nails fall through them .
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 26]: I have put in one piece more than agreed for ; and if I do n't put in another here she 'll never swim . ''
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 15]: `` Well , then , put another piece in , '' replied Mrs Beazeley .
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 22]: `` Yes ; so I will ; but I 've a notion I shall be out of pocket by this job .
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 9]: Seven-and-sixpence wo n't pay for labour and all .
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 28]: However , never mind , '' and Tom carolled forth -- `` Is not the sea Made for the free -- Land for courts and chains alone ?
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 18]: There we are slaves , But on the waves Love and liberty 's all our own . ''
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 19]: `` Now , if you do sing , sing truth , Beazeley , '' said the old woman .
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 11]: `` A 'n' t our boy pressed into the service ?
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 9]: And how can you talk of liberty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 32]: Old Tom answered by continuing his song -- `` No eye to watch , and no tongue to wound us ; All earth forgot , and all heaven around us . ''
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 19]: `` Yes , yes , '' replied the old woman ; `` no eye to watch , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 32]: He may be in sickness and in sorrow ; he may be wounded , or dying of a fever ; and there 's no mother 's eye to watch over him .
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 20]: As to all the earth being forgot , I wo n't believe that Tom has forgotten his mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 21]: Old Tom replied -- `` Seasons may roll , But the true soul Burns the same wherever it goes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 37]: `` So it does , Tom -- so it does ; and he 's thinking this moment of his father and mother , I do verily believe , and he loves us more than ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 23]: `` So I believe , '' replied old Tom -- `` that is , if he has n't anything better to do .
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 29]: But there 's a time for all things ; and when a man is doing his duty as a seaman , he must n't let his thoughts wander .
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 12]: Never fear , old woman : he 'll be back again .
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 23]: `` There 's a sweet little cherub that sits up aloft , To take care of the life of poor Jack . ''
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 5]: `` God grant it !
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 5]: God grant it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 18]: replied the old woman , wiping her eyes with her apron , and then resuming her netting .
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 45]: `` He seems , '' continued she , `` by his letters , to be over-fond of that girl , Mary Stapleton -- and I sometimes think that she cares not a little for him ; but she 's never of one mind long .
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 34]: I did n't like to see her flaunting and flirting so with the soldiers , and at the same time Tom says that she writes that she cares for nobody but him . ''
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 6]: `` Women are -- women !
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 64]: that 's sartin , '' replied old Tom , musing for a time , and then showing that his thoughts were running on his son , by bursting out -- `` Mary , when yonder boundless sea Shall part us , and perchance for ever , Think not my heart can stray from thee , Or cease to mourn thine absence -- never !
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 34]: And when in distant climes I roam , Forlorn , unfriended , broken-hearted -- '' `` Do n't say so , Tom -- do n't say so , '' interrupted the old woman .
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 23]: Tom continued -- `` Oft shall I sigh for thee and home , And all those joys from which I parted . ''
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 17]: `` Aye , so he does , poor fellow , I 'll be bound to say .
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 13]: What would I give to see his dear , smiling face ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 4]: said Mrs Beazeley .
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 12]: `` And I 'd give no little , missus , myself .
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 27]: But still , it 's the duty for every man to serve his country ; and so ought Tom , as his father did before him .
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 19]: I shall be glad to see him back : but I 'm not sorry that he 's gone .
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 30]: Our ships must be manned , old woman ; and if they take men by force , it 's only because they wo n't volunteer -- that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 12]: When they 're once on board they do n't mind it .
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 21]: You women require pressing just as much as the men , and it 's all much of a muchness . ''
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 7]: `` How 's that Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 27]: `` Why , when we make love , and ask you to marry , do n't you always pout , and say , ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 13]: You like being kissed , but we must take it by force .
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 8]: So it is with manning a ship .
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 35]: The men all say , ` No ; ' but when they are once there , they like the service very much -- only , you see , like you , they want pressing .
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 28]: Do n't Tom write and say that he 's quite happy , and do n't care where he is so long as he 's with Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 36]: `` Yes ; that 's true ; but they say Jacob is to be discharged and come home , now that he 's come to a fortune ; and what will Tom say then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 12]: `` Why , that _ is _ the worst of it .
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 20]: I believe that Jacob 's heart is in the right place ; but still , riches spoil a man .
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 5]: But we shall see .
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 19]: If Jacob do n't prove ` true blue , ' I 'll never put faith in man again .
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 12]: But there be changes in this world , that 's sartin .
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 46]: `` We all have our taste of the ups and the downs , As Fortune dispenses her smiles and her frowns ; But may we not hope , if she 's frowning to-day , That to-morrow she 'll lend us the light of her ray .
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 13]: `` I only wish Jacob was here -- that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 25]: `` Then you have your wish , my good old friend , '' cried I , running up to Tom and seizing his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 30]: But old Tom was so taken by surprise that he started back and lost his equilibrium , dragging me after him , and we rolled on the turf together .
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 40]: Nor was this the only accident , for old Mrs Beazeley was so alarmed that she also sprang from the bench fixed in the half of the old boat stuck on end , and threw herself back against it .
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 29]: The boat , rotten when first put up , and with the disadvantage of exposure to the elements for many years , could no longer stand such pressure .
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 47]: It gave way to the sudden force applied by the old woman , and she and the boat went down together , she screaming and scuffling among the rotten planks , which now , after so many years close intimacy , were induced to part company .
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 46]: I was first on my legs , and ran to the assistance of Mrs Beazeley , who was half smothered with dust and flakes of dry pitch ; and old Tom coming to my assistance , we put the old woman on her legs again .
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 6]: `` O deary me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 10]: cried the old woman -- `` O deary me !
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 8]: I do believe my hip is out !
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 11]: Lord , Mr Jacob , how you frightened me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 27]: `` Yes , '' said old Tom , shaking me warmly by the hand , `` we were all taken aback , old boat and all .
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 14]: What a shindy you have made , bowling us all down like ninepins !
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 24]: Well , my boy , I 'm glad to see you , and notwithstanding your gear , you 're Jacob Faithful still . ''
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 41]: `` I hope so , '' replied I ; and we then adjourned to the house , where I made them acquainted with all that had passed , and what I intended to do relative to obtaining Tom 's discharge .
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 47]: I then left them , promising to return soon , and , hailing a wherry going up the river , proceeded to my old friend the Dominie , of whose welfare , as well as Stapleton 's and Mary 's , I had been already assured .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 28]: But as I passed through Putney Bridge I thought I might as well call first upon old Stapleton ; and I desired the waterman to pull in .
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 35]: I hastened to Stapleton 's lodgings , and went upstairs , where I found Mary in earnest conversation with a very good-looking young man , in a sergeant 's uniform of the 93rd Regiment .
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 45]: Mary , who was even handsomer than when I had left her , starting up , at first did not appear to recognise me , then coloured up to the forehead , as she welcomed me with a constraint I had never witnessed before .
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 43]: The sergeant appeared inclined to keep his ground ; but on my taking her hand and telling her that I brought a message from a person whom I trusted she had not forgotten , he gave her a nod and walked downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 52]: Perhaps there was a severity in my countenance as I said , `` Mary , I do not know whether , after what I have seen , I ought to give the message ; and the pleasure I anticipated in meeting you again is destroyed by what I have now witnessed .
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 35]: How disgraceful is it thus to play with a man 's feelings -- to write to him , assuring him of your regard and constancy , and at the same time encouraging another . ''
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 6]: Mary hung down her head .
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 33]: `` If I have done wrong , Mr Faithful , '' said she , after a pause , `` I have not wronged Tom ; what I have written I felt . ''
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 14]: `` If that is the case , why do you wrong another person ?
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 12]: why encourage another young man only to make him unhappy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 19]: `` I have promised him nothing ; but why does not Tom come back and look after me ?
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 35]: I ca n't mope here by myself ; I have no one to keep company with ; my father is always away at the alehouse , and I must have somebody to talk to .
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 29]: Besides , Tom is away , and may be away a long while , and absence cures love in men , although it does not in women . ''
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 24]: `` It appears then , Mary , that you wish to have two strings to your bow , in case of accident . ''
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 18]: `` Should the first string break , a second would be very acceptable , '' replied Mary .
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 67]: `` But it is always this way , '' continued she , with increasing warmth ; `` I never can be in a situation which is not right ; whenever I do anything which may appear improper , so certain do _ you _ make your appearance when least expected and least wished for -- as if you were born to be my constant accuser . ''
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 12]: `` Does not your own conscience accuse you , Mary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 61]: `` Mr Faithful , '' repeated she , very warmly , `` you are not my father confessor ; but do as you please -- write to Tom if you please , and tell him all you have seen , and anything you may think -- make him and make me miserable and unhappy -- do it , I pray .
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 30]: It will be a friendly act ; and as you are now a great man , you may persuade Tom that I am a jilt and a good-for-nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 15]: Here Mary laid her hands on the table and buried her face in them .
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 59]: `` I did not come here to be your censor , Mary ; you are certainly at liberty to act as you please , without my having any right to interfere ; but as Tom is my earliest and best friend , so far as his interests and happiness are concerned , I shall carefully watch over them .
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 67]: We have been so long together , and I am so well acquainted with all his feelings , that I really believe that if ever there was a young man sincerely and devotedly attached to a woman , he is so to you ; and I will add , that if ever there was a young man who deserved love in return , it is Tom .
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 48]: When I left , not a month back , he desired me to call upon you as soon as I could , and assure you of his unalterable attachment ; and I am now about to procure his discharge , that he may be able to return .
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 49]: All his thoughts are upon this point , and he is now waiting with the utmost impatience the arrival of it , that he may again be in your company ; you can best judge whether his return will or will not be a source of happiness . ''
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 12]: Mary raised her head -- her face was wet with tears .
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 15]: `` Then he will soon be back again , and I shall see him .
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 47]: Indeed , his return will be no source of unhappiness , if I can make him happy -- indeed , it shall not , Mr Faithful ; but pray do n't tell him of my foolish conduct , pray do n't -- why make him unhappy ?
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 9]: -- I entreat you not to do it .
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 7]: I will not do so again .
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 9]: Promise me , Jacob , will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 16]: continued Mary , taking me by the arm , and looking beseechingly in my face .
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 21]: `` Mary , I will never be a mischief-maker ; but recollect I exact the performance of your promise . ''
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 19]: `` Oh , and I will keep it , now that I know he will soon be home .
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 21]: I can , I think I can -- I 'm sure I can wait a month or two without flirting .
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 13]: But I do wish that I was not left so much alone .
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 19]: I wish Tom was at home to take care of me , for there is no one else .
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 9]: I ca n't take care of myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 31]: I saw by Mary 's countenance that she was in earnest , and I therefore made friends with her , and we conversed for two hours , chiefly about Tom .
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 36]: When I left her she had recovered her usual spirits , and said at parting , looking archly at me , `` Now , you will see how wise and prudent I shall be . ''
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 37]: I shook my head , and left her that I might find out -LSB- my -RSB- old friend Stapleton , who , as usual , was at the door of the public-house , smoking his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 50]: At first he did not recognise me , for when I accosted him he put his open hand to his ear as usual , and desired me to speak a little louder , but I answered , `` Nonsense , Stapleton , that wo n't do with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 18]: He then took his pipe out of his mouth , and looked me full in the face .
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 8]: `` Jacob , as I 'm alive !
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 18]: Did n't know you in your long togs -- thought you was a gentleman wanting a boat .
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 26]: Well , I hardly need say how glad I am to see you after so long ; that 's no more than human natur ' .
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 5]: And how 's Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 6]: Have you seen Mary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 13]: These two questions enabled me to introduce the subject that I wished .
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 27]: I told him of the attachment and troth pledged between the two , and how wrong it was for him to leave her so much alone .
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 79]: The old man agreed with me , and said , that as to talking to the men , that was on Mary 's part nothing but `` human natur ' '' ; and that as for Tom wishing to be at home and seeing her again , that also was nothing but `` human natur ' '' ; but that he would smoke his pipe at home in future , and keep the soldiers out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 21]: Satisfied with this assurance I left him , and taking another wherry went up to Brentford to see the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 67]: ALL THE LITTLE BOYS ARE LET LOOSE , AND THE DOMINIE IS CAUGHT -- ANXIOUS TO SUPPLY MY TEETH , HE FALLS IN WITH OTHER TEETH , AND MRS. BATELY ALSO SHOWS HER TEETH -- GIN OUTSIDE , GIN IN , AND GIN OUT AGAIN , AND OLD WOMAN OUT ALSO -- DOMINIE IN FOR IT AGAIN -- MORE LIKE A WHIG MINISTRY THAN A NOVEL .
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 37]: I found the worthy old Dominie in the school-room , seated at his elevated desk , the usher not present , and the boys making a din enough to have awaked a person from a trance .
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 23]: That he was in one of his deep reveries , and that the boys had taken advantage of it , was evident .
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 21]: `` Mr Dobbs , '' said I , walking close up to the desk , but the Dominie answered not .
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 9]: I repeated his name in a louder voice .
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 28]: `` Cosine of _ X plus AB minus Z minus a half _ ; such must be the result , '' said the Dominie talking to himself .
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 8]: `` Yet it doth not prove correct .
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 6]: I may be in error .
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 22]: Let me revise my work , '' and the Dominie lifted up his desk to take out another piece of paper .
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 17]: When the desk lid was raised , I removed his work and held it behind me .
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 7]: `` But how is this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 13]: exclaimed the Dominie , and he looked everywhere for his previous calculations .
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 32]: `` Nay , '' continued he , `` it must have been the wind ; '' and then he cast his eyes about until they fixed upon me laughing at him .
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 3]: `` Eheu !
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 6]: what do my eyes perceive ?
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 20]: -- It is -- yet it is not -- yes , most truly it is , my son Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 23]: Welcome , most welcome , '' cried the old man , descending from his desk , and clasping me in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 21]: `` Long is it since I have seen thee , my son , _ Interea magnum sol circumvolvitur annum _ .
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 33]: Long , yes long , have I yearned for thy return , fearful lest , _ nudus ignota arena _ , thou mightest , like another Palinurus , have been cast away .
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 40]: Thou art returned , and all is well ; as the father said in the Scripture : I have found my son which I had lost ; but no prodigal thou , though I use the quotation as apt .
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 50]: Now all is well ; thou hast escaped the danger of the battle , the fire , and the wreck , and now thou mayest hang up thy wet garment as a votive offering ; as Horace hath it , _ Uvida suspendisse potenti vestimenta maris Deo _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 52]: During the apostrophe of the Dominie , the boys perceiving that he was no longer wrapped up in his algebra , had partly settled to their desks , and in their apparent attention to their lessons reminded me of the humming of bees before a hive on a summer 's day .
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 33]: `` Boys , '' cried the Dominie , '' _ nunc est ludendum _ ; verily ye shall have a holiday ; put up your books , and depart in peace . ''
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 45]: The books were hastily put up , in obedience to the command ; the depart in peace was not so rigidly adhered to -- they gave a loud shout , and in a few seconds the Dominie and I stood alone in the school-room .
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 19]: `` Come , Jacob , let us adjourn to my sanctum ; there may we commune without interruption .
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 30]: Thou shalt tell me thine adventures , and I will communicate to thee what hath been made known to me relative to those with whom thou wert acquainted . ''
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 31]: `` First let me beg you to give me something to eat , for I am not a little hungry , '' interrupted I , as we gained the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 52]: `` Verily shalt thou have all that we possess , Jacob ; yet now , I think , that will not be much , seeing that I and our worthy matron did pick the bones of a shoulder of mutton , this having been our fourth day of repast upon it .
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 21]: She is out , yet I will venture to intrude into the privacy of her cupboard , for thy sake .
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 14]: Peradventure she may be wroth , yet will I risk her displeasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 25]: So saying , the old Dominie opened the cupboard , and , one by one , handed to me the dishes with their contents .
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 10]: `` Here Jacob are two hard dumplings from yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 9]: Canst thou relish cold , hard , dumplings ?
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 23]: -- but , stop , here is something more savoury -- half of a cold cabbage , which was left this day .
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 5]: We will look again .
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 30]: Here is meat -- yes , it is meat ; but now do I perceive it is a piece of lights reserved for the dinner of the cat to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 19]: I am fearful that we must not venture upon that , for the dame will be wroth . ''
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 19]: `` Pray put it back , sir ; I would not interfere with puss on any account . ''
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 22]: `` Nay , then , Jacob , I see naught else , unless there may be viands on the upper shelf .
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 35]: Sir , here is bread , the staff of life , and also a fragment of cheese ; and now , methinks , I discern something dark at the back of the shelf . ''
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 21]: The Dominie extended his hand , and immediately withdrew it , jumping from his chair , with a loud cry .
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 35]: He had put his fingers into a rat gin , set by the old woman for those intruders , and he held up his arm and stamped as he shouted out with the pain .
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 58]: I hastened to him , and pressing down the spring , released his fingers from the teeth , which , however , had drawn blood , as well as bruised him ; fortunately , like most of the articles of their menage , the trap was a very old one , and he was not much hurt .
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 19]: The Dominie thrust his fingers into his capacious mouth , and held them there some time without speaking .
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 14]: He began to feel a little ease , when in came the matron .
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 9]: `` Why , what 's all this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 8]: said she , in a querulous tone .
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 12]: `` Jacob here , and all my cupboard on the table .
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 11]: Jacob , how dare you go to my cupboard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 29]: `` It was the Dominie , Mrs Bately , who looked there for something for me to eat , and he has been caught in a rat-trap . ''
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 12]: `` Serve him right ; I have forbade him that cupboard .
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 8]: Have I not , Mr Dobbs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 39]: `` Yea , and verily , '' quoth the Dominie , `` and I do repent me that I took not thine advice , for look at my fingers ; '' and the Dominie extended his lacerated digits .
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 4]: `` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 23]: well I 'd no idea that a rat-trap pinched so hard , '' replied the old woman , whose wrath was appeased .
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 38]: `` How it must hurt the poor things -- I wo n't set it again , but leave them all to the cat ; he 'll kill them , if he only can get at them . ''
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 47]: The old lady went to a drawer , unlocked it , brought out some fragments of rags , and a bottle of friar 's balsam , which she applied to the Dominie 's hand , and then bound it up , scolding him the whole time .
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 21]: `` How stupid of you , Mr Dobbs ; you know that I was only out for a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 15]: Why did n't you wait -- and why did you go to the cupboard ?
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 13]: Hav 'n' t I always told you not to look into it ?
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 8]: and now you see the consequences . ''
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 11]: `` Verily my hand burneth , '' replied the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 14]: `` I will go for cold water , and it will ease you .
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 30]: What a deal of trouble you do give , Mr Dobbs ; you 're worse than a charity boy ; '' and the old lady departed to the pump .
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 31]: `` Vinegar is a better thing , sir , '' said I , `` and there is a bottle in the cupboard , which I dare say is vinegar . ''
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 20]: I went to the cupboard , and brought out the bottle , took out the cork and smelt it .
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 15]: `` This is not vinegar , sir , it is Hollands or gin . ''
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 31]: `` Then would I like a glass , Jacob , for I feel a sickening faintness upon me ; yet be quick , peradventure the old woman may return . ''
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 33]: `` Drink out of the bottle , sir , '' said I , perceiving that the Dominie looked very pale , `` and I will give you notice of her approach . ''
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 38]: The Dominie put the bottle to his mouth , and was taking a sufficient draught , when the old woman returned by another door which was behind us ; she had gone that way for a wash-basin .
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 36]: Before we could perceive her , she came behind the Dominie , snatched the bottle from his mouth with a jerk that threw a portion of the spirits in his eyes , and blinded him .
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 17]: `` That 's why you went to my cupboard , is it , Mr Dobbs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 7]: cried she , in a passion .
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 8]: `` That 's it , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 30]: I thought my bottle went very fast ; seeing that I do n't take more than a tea-spoonful every night , for the wind which vexes me so much .
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 26]: I 'll set the rat-trap again , you may depend upon it ; and now you may get somebody else to bind your fingers . ''
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 20]: `` It was I who took it out , Mrs Bately ; the Dominie would have fainted with pain .
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 29]: It was very lucky that he has a housekeeper who is careful to have something of the kind in the house , or he might have been dead .
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 16]: You surely do n't begrudge a little of your medicine to recover Mr Dobbs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 20]: `` Peace , woman , peace , '' said the Dominie , who had gained courage by his potation .
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 49]: `` Peace , I say ; I knew not that thou hadst in thy cupboard either a gin for my hand , or gin for my mouth ; since I have been taken in the one , it is but fair that I should take in the other .
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 13]: In future both thy gins will not be interfered with by me .
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 36]: Bring me the basin , that I may appease my angry wounds , and then hasten to procure some viands to appease the hunger of my son Jacob ; lastly , appease thine own wrath .
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 4]: _ Pax _ .
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 37]: Peace , I say ; '' and the old woman , who perceived that the Dominie had asserted his right of dominion , went to obey his orders , grumbling till she was out of hearing .
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 31]: The application of the cold pump-water soon relieved the pain of the good old Dominie , and with his hand remaining in the basin , we commenced a long conversation .
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 20]: At first I narrated to him the events which had occurred during my service on board of the frigate .
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 31]: When I told him of my parting with Tom , he observed , `` Verily do I remember that young Tom , a jocund , pleasant , yet intrusive lad .
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 21]: Yet do I wish him well , and am grieved that he should be so taken by that maiden Mary .
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 35]: Well may we say of her , as Horace hath of Pyrrha -- ` _ Quis multa gracilis te puer in rosa , perfusis liquidis urgit odoribus , grate , Pyrrha , sub antro .
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 10]: Cui flavam religas comam , simplex munditiis _ . '
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 10]: I grieve at it , yea , grieve much .
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 10]: _ Heu , quoties fidem mutatosque Deos flebit _ !
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 22]: Verily , Jacob , I do prophesy that she will lead him into error , yea , perhaps into perdition . ''
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 18]: `` I trust not , sir , '' replied I ; but the Dominie made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 44]: For half-an-hour he was in deep and serious thought , during which Mrs Bately entered , and spreading a cloth , brought in from the other room some rashers of bacon and eggs , upon which I made a hasty and hearty meal .
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 35]: The old matron 's temper was now smoothed , and she welcomed me kindly , and shortly after went out for a fresh basin of cold water for the Dominie to bathe his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 10]: This roused him , and he recommenced the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 39]: `` Jacob , I have not yet congratulated thee upon thy accession to wealth ; not that I do not sincerely rejoice in it , but because the pleasure of thy presence has made me unmindful of it .
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 31]: Still , was it fortunate for thee that thou hadst raised up such a friend as Mr Turnbull ; otherwise what would have been the result of thy boasted independence ?
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 28]: Thou wouldst probably have remained many years on board of a man-of-war , and have been killed , or have returned mutilated , to die unknown . ''
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 52]: `` You were right , sir , '' replied I ; `` my independence was nothing but pride ; and I did bitterly repent , as you said I should do , even before I was pressed into the king 's service -- but Mr Drummond never repeated his offers . ''
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 58]: `` He never did , Jacob ; but as I have since been informed by him , although he was taken by surprise at thy being forced away to serve thy country , still he was not sure that you would accept them ; and he , moreover , wished you fully to feel thine own folly .
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 25]: Long before you had made friends with him , he had attested the will of Mr Turnbull , and was acquainted with the contents .
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 65]: Yet , did he watch over thee , and had he thought that thy way of life had led thee into that which was wrong , he would have interfered to save thee ; but he considered with Shakespeare that ` sweet were the uses of adversity , ' and that thou wouldst be more schooled by remaining some time under her unprepossessing frowns .
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 8]: He hath ever been thy friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 6]: `` I can believe it .
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 11]: I trust he is well , and his family . ''
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 30]: `` They were well and prosperous , but a little while ago , Jacob ; yet I have seen but little of them since the death of Mr Turnbull .
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 15]: It will pain thee to hear that affliction at thy absence hastened his dissolution .
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 47]: I was at his death-bed , Jacob ; and I verily believe he was a good man , and will meet the reward of one ; yet did he talk most strangely , and reminded me of that remnant of a man you call old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 92]: ` It 's no use , old gentleman , ' said he , as he lay in his bed supported by pillows , for he had wasted away till he was but a skeleton , having broken a blood-vessel with his violent coughing -- ` It 's no use pouring that doctor 's stuff down my throat ; my anchor 's short stay a-peak , and in a few minutes I shall trip it , I trust for heaven , where I hope there are moorings laid down for me . '
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 19]: ` I would fain comprehend thee , ' replied I , ` but thou speakest in parables . '
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 24]: ` I mean to say that death has driven his harpoon in up to the shank , and that I struggle in vain .
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 8]: I have run out all my line .
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 31]: I shall turn up in a few minutes -- so give my love and blessing to Jacob -- he saved my life once -- but now I 'm gone . '
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 30]: With these last words his spirit took its flight ; and thus , Jacob , did your benefactor breathe his last , invoking a blessing on your head . ''
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 26]: I remained silent for a few minutes , for I was much affected by the Dominie 's description ; he at length resumed the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 12]: `` Thou hast not yet seen the Drummonds , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 36]: `` I have not , '' I replied , `` but I will call upon them tomorrow ; but it is time that I should go , for I have to return to London . ''
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 7]: `` Thou needst not , Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 8]: Thine own house is at hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 6]: `` My own house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 50]: `` Yes ; by the will of Mr Turnbull , his wife has been left a handsome jointure , but , for reasons which he did not explain , the house and furniture are not left to her , but , as residuary legatee , belong to thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 8]: -- then where is Mrs Turnbull ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 12]: `` At Bath , where she hath taken up her residence .
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 41]: Mr Drummond , who hath acted in thy behalf , permitted her to take away such articles as she might wish , but they were but few , chiefly those little objects which filled up rather than adorned the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 18]: The house is all ready for thy reception , and thou mayst take possession this evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 14]: `` But why did not Mr Turnbull leave it to his widow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 21]: `` I can not exactly say , but I think he did not wish her to remain in this place .
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 23]: He , therefore , left her 5000 pounds at her own disposal , to enable her to purchase and furnish another . ''
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 26]: I then took my leave of the Dominie , and it being rather late , I resolved to walk to the house and sleep there .
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 44]: IN WHICH I TAKE POSSESSION OF MY OWN HOUSE , AND THINK THAT IT LOOKS VERY ILL-FURNISHED WITHOUT A WIFE -- TOM 'S DISCHARGE IS SENT OUT , BUT BY ACCIDENT IT NEVER REACHES HIM -- I TAKE MY NEW STATION IN SOCIETY .
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 21]: On my arrival the front gates were opened by the gardener 's wife , who made me a profound courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 12]: The gardener soon afterwards made his appearance , hat in hand .
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 8]: Everything was neat and in good order .
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 17]: I entered the house , and as soon as possible rid myself of their obsequious attentions .
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 6]: I wished to be alone .
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 7]: Powerful feelings crowded on my mind .
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 20]: I hastened to Mr Turnbull 's study , and sat down in the chair so lately occupied by him .
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 34]: The proud feeling of possession , softened into gratitude to heaven , and sorrow at his death , came over me , and I remained for a long while in a deep reverie .
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 47]: `` And all this , and more , much more , are mine , '' I mentally exclaimed ; `` the sailor before the mast , the waterman on the river , the charity-boy , the orphan sits down in quiet possession of luxury and wealth .
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 10]: What have I done to deserve all this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 26]: My heart told me nothing , or if anything , it was almost valueless , and I poured forth my soul in thanks to heaven .
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 20]: I felt more composed after I had performed this duty , and my thoughts then dwelt upon my benefactor .
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 37]: I surveyed the room -- the drawings , the furs and skins , the harpoons and other instruments , all remaining in their respective places , as when I last had an interview with Mr Turnbull .
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 31]: I remembered his kindness , his singleness of heart , his honesty , his good sense , and his real worth ; and I shed many tears for his loss .
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 17]: My thoughts then passed to Sarah Drummond , and I felt much uneasiness on that score .
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 15]: Would she receive me , or would she still remember what I had been ?
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 9]: I recollected her kindness and good-will towards me .
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 27]: I weighed these , and my present condition , against my origin and my former occupation ; and could not ascertain how the scale might turn .
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 16]: I shall soon see , thought I. To-morrow , even , may decide the question .
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 17]: The gardener 's wife knocked at the door , and announced that my bed was prepared .
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 18]: I went to sleep , dreaming of Sarah , young Tom , the Dominie and Mary Stapleton .
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 49]: I was up early the next morning , and hastened to the hotel ; when , having arranged my person to the best of my power -LRB- but at the same time never so little to my satisfaction -RRB- , I proceeded to the house of Mr Drummond .
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 25]: I knocked ; and this time I was not desired to wait in the hall , but was immediately ushered up into the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 9]: Sarah Drummond was sitting alone at her drawing .
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 8]: My name was announced as I entered .
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 15]: She started from her chair , and blushed deeply as she moved towards me .
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 6]: We joined hands in silence .
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 6]: I was breathless with emotion .
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 7]: Never had she appeared so beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 25]: Neither party appeared willing to break silence ; at last I faltered out , `` Miss Drummond , '' -- and then I stopped .
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 55]: `` Mr Faithful , '' replied she ; and then , after a break -- `` How very silly this is ; I ought to have congratulated you upon your safe return , and upon your good fortune ; and , indeed , Mr Faithful , no one can do so more sincerely . ''
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 77]: `` Miss Drummond , '' replied I , confused , `` when I was an orphan , a charity-boy , and a waterman , you called me Jacob , if the alteration in my prospects induces you to address me in so formal a manner -- if we are in future to be on such different terms -- I can only say that I wish that I were again -- Jacob Faithful , the waterman . ''
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 20]: `` Nay , '' replied she , `` recollect that it was your own choice to be a waterman .
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 9]: You might have been different -- very different .
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 28]: You might at this time have been a partner with my father , for he said so but last night , when we were talking about you .
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 28]: But you refused all ; you threw away your education , your talents , your good qualities , from a foolish pride , which you considered independence .
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 36]: My father almost humbled himself to you -- not that it is ever humiliating to acknowledge and attempt to repair a fault , but still he did more than could be expected from most people .
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 26]: Your friends persuaded you , but you rejected their advice ; and what was still more unpardonable , even I had no influence over you .
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 31]: As long as you punished yourself I did not upbraid you ; but now that you have been so fortunate , I tell you plainly -- '' `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 14]: `` That it is more than you deserve , that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 11]: `` You have said but the truth , Miss Drummond .
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 38]: I was very proud and very foolish ; but I had repented of my folly long before I was pressed ; and I candidly acknowledge that I do not merit the good fortune I have met with .
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 6]: Can I say more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 12]: `` No ; I am satisfied with your repentance and acknowledgment .
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 14]: So , now you may sit down , and make yourself agreeable . ''
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 26]: `` Before I do that , allow me to ask , as you address me as Mr Faithful , how am I to address you ?
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 10]: I should not wish to be considered impertinent . ''
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 19]: `` My name is Miss Drummond , but those who feel intimate with me call me Sarah . ''
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 22]: `` I may reply that my name is Faithful , but those who feel intimate with me call me Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 16]: `` Very true ; but allow me to observe that you show very little tact .
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 10]: You should never force a lady into a corner .
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 22]: If I appear affronted when you call me Sarah , then you will do wise to fall back upon Miss Drummond .
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 13]: But why do you fix your eyes upon me so earnestly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 26]: `` I can not help it , and must beg your pardon ; but you are so improved in appearance since I last saw you .
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 24]: I thought no one could be more perfect , but -- '' `` Well , that 's not a bad beginning , Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 8]: I like to hear of my perfections .
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 9]: Now follow up your _ but _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 36]: `` I hardly know what I was going to say , but I think it was that I do not feel as if I ought or can address you otherwise than as Miss Drummond . ''
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 13]: `` Oh , you 've thought better of it , have you ?
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 41]: Well , I begin to think myself that you look so well in your present dress , and have become so very different a person , that I ought not to address you by any other name than Mr Faithful .
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 7]: So now we are agreed . ''
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 11]: `` That 's not what I mean to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 16]: `` Well , then , let me know what you did mean to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 22]: This puzzling question fortunately did not require an answer , for Mr Drummond came into the room and extended his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 38]: `` My dear Jacob , '' said he , in the most friendly manner , `` I 'm delighted to see you back again , and to have the pleasure of congratulating you on your good fortune .
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 14]: But you have business to transact which will not admit of any delay .
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 16]: You must prove the will , and arrange with the lawyers as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 5]: Will you come now ?
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 15]: All the papers are below , and I have the whole morning to spare .
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 17]: We will be back to dinner , Sarah , if Jacob has no other engagement . ''
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 22]: `` I have none , '' replied I ; `` and shall be most happy to avail myself of your kindness .
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 12]: Miss Drummond , I wish you a good morning . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 20]: _ Au revoir _ , Mr Faithful , '' replied Sarah , courtesying formally , with a mocking smile .
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 28]: The behaviour of Mr Drummond towards me was most kind and parental , and my eyes were often suffused with tears during the occupation of the morning .
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 41]: The most urgent business was got through , and an interview with Mr Turnbull 's solicitor put the remainder in progress ; still it was so late when we had accomplished it , that I had no time to dress .
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 13]: On my return , Mrs Drummond received me with her usual kindness .
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 39]: I narrated , during the evening , my adventures since we parted , and took that opportunity to acknowledge to Mr Drummond how bitterly I had repented my folly , and I may add ingratitude , towards him .
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 76]: `` Jacob , '' said he , as we were sitting at the tea-table with Mrs Drummond and Sarah , `` I knew at the time that you were toiling on the river for shillings that you were the inheritor of thousands ; for I not only witnessed but read the will of Mr Turnbull ; but I thought it best that you should have a lesson which you would never forget in after life .
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 17]: There is no such thing in this world as independence , unless in a savage state .
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 11]: In society we are all mutually dependent upon each other .
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 11]: Independence of mind we may have , but no more .
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 41]: As a waterman , you were dependent upon your customers , as every poor man must be upon those who have more means ; and in refusing my _ offers _ you were obliged to apply for employment to others .
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 30]: The rich are as entirely dependent upon others as the poor ; they depend upon them for their food , their clothes , their necessities , and their luxuries .
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 31]: Such ever will be the case in society , and the more refined the society may be -- the more civilised its parts -- the greater is the mutual dependence .
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 70]: Still it is an error originating in itself from high feelings , and therefore must be considered as an error on the right side ; but recollect how much you might have thrown away had not you , in the first place , secured such a friend as Mr Turnbull ; and secondly , if the death of that friend had not so soon put you in possession . ''
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 13]: I was but too ready to acknowledge the truth of these remarks .
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 41]: The evening passed away so rapidly that it was midnight before I rose to take my leave , and I returned to the hotel as happy in my mind , and as grateful as ever any mortal could possibly be .
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 25]: The next day I removed to the house left me by Mr Turnbull , and the first order I gave was for a wherry .
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 44]: Such was the force of habit , I could not do without one ; and half my time was spent upon the river , pulling every day down to Mr Drummond 's , and returning in the evening , or late at night .
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 22]: Thus passed away two months , during which I occasionally saw the Dominie , the Stapletons , and old Tom Beazeley .
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 32]: I had exerted myself to procure Tom 's discharge , and at last had the pleasure of telling the old people that it was to go out by the next packet .
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 54]: By the Drummonds I was received as a member of the family -- there was no hindrance to my being alone with Sarah for hours ; and although I had not ventured to declare my sentiments , they appeared to be well understood , as well by the parents as by Sarah herself .
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 68]: Two days after I had communicated this welcome intelligence to the old couple , as I was sitting at breakfast , attended by the gardener and his wife -LRB- for I had made no addition to my establishment -RRB- , what was my surprise at the appearance of young _ Tom _ , who entered the room as usual , laughing as he held out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 4]: `` Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 13]: exclaimed I , `` why , how did you come here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 12]: `` By water , Jacob , as you may suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 9]: `` But how have you received your discharge ?
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 7]: Is the ship come home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 16]: `` I hope not ; the fact is , I discharged myself , Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 5]: did you desert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 4]: `` Even so .
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 8]: I had three reasons for so doing .
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 61]: In the first place , I could not remain without you ; in the second , my mother wrote to say Mary was taken up with a sodger ; and the third was , I was put into the report for punishment , and should have been flogged , as sure as the captain had a pair of epaulettes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 13]: `` Well , but sit down and tell me all about it .
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 8]: You know your discharge is obtained . ''
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 22]: `` Yes , thanks to you , Jacob ; all the better , for now they wo n't look after me .
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 7]: All 's well that ends well .
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 39]: After you went away , I presume I was not in the very best of humours ; and that rascal of a master 's mate who had us pressed , thought proper to bully me beyond all bearing .
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 50]: One day he called me a lying scoundrel ; upon which I forgot that I was on board of a man-of-war , and replied that he was a confounded cheat , and that he had better pay me his debt of two guineas for bringing him down the river .
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 93]: He reported me on the quarter-deck for calling him a cheat , and Captain Maclean , who , you know , wo n't stand any nonsense , heard the arguments on both sides ; upon which he declared that the conduct of the master 's mate was not that of an officer or a gentleman , and therefore _ he _ should leave the ship ; and that my language to my superior officer was subversive to the discipline of the service , and therefore he should give me a good flogging .
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 83]: Now , Jacob , you know that if the officers do n't pay their debts , Captain Maclean always does , and with interest into the bargain ; so finding that I was in for it , and no mistake , I swam ashore the night before Black Monday , and made my way to Miramichi , without any adventure , except a tussle with a sergeant of marines , whom I left for dead about three miles out of the town .
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 17]: At Miramichi I got on board of a timber ship , and here I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 22]: `` I am sorry that you deserted , nevertheless , '' replied I ; `` it may come to mischief . ''
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 23]: `` Never fear ; the people on the river know that I have my discharge , and I 'm safe enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 7]: `` Have you seen Mary ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 11]: `` Yes , and all 's right in that quarter .
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 17]: I shall build another wherry , wear my badge and dress , and stick above bridge .
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 19]: When I 'm all settled , I 'll splice , and live along with the old couple . ''
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 9]: `` But will Mary consent to live there ?
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 14]: It is so quiet and retired that she wo n't like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 21]: `` Mary Stapleton has given herself airs enough in all conscience , and has had her own way quite enough .
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 18]: Mary Beazeley will do as her husband wishes , or I will know the reason why . ''
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 7]: `` We shall see , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 11]: Bachelors ' wives are always best managed , they say .
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 11]: But now you want money to buy your boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 36]: `` Yes , if you 'll lend it to me ; I do n't like to take it away from the old people ; and I 'll pay you when I can , Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 30]: `` No ; you must accept this , Tom ; and when you marry you must accept something more , '' replied I , handing the notes to him .
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 8]: `` With all my heart , Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 25]: I never can repay you for what you have done for me , and so I may just as well increase the debt . ''
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 9]: `` That 's good logic , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 14]: `` Quite as good as independence ; is it not , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 19]: `` Better , much better , as I know to my cost , '' replied I , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 11]: Tom finished his breakfast , and then took his leave .
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 46]: After breakfast , as usual , I went to the boat-house , and unchaining my wherry , pulled up the river , which I had not hitherto done ; my attendance upon Sarah having invariably turned the bow of my wherry in the opposite direction .
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 32]: I swept by the various residences on the banks of the river until I arrived opposite to that of Mr Wharncliffe , and perceived a lady and gentleman in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 24]: I knew them at once , and , as they were standing close to the wall , I pulled in and saluted them .
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 7]: `` Do you recollect me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 7]: said I to them , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 25]: `` Yes , '' replied the lady , `` I do recollect your face -- surely -- it is Faithful , the waterman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 20]: `` No , I am not a waterman ; I am only amusing myself in my own boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 22]: `` Come up , '' replied Mr Wharncliffe ; `` we ca n't shake hands with you at that distance . ''
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 9]: I made fast my wherry and joined them .
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 6]: They received me most cordially .
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 24]: `` I thought you were not a waterman , Mr Faithful , although you said that you were , '' said Mrs Wharncliffe .
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 11]: `` Why did you deceive us in that way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 28]: `` Indeed , at that time I was , from my own choice and my own folly a waterman ; now I am so no longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 17]: We were soon on the most intimate terms , and I narrated part of my adventures .
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 16]: They expressed their obligations to me , and requested that I would accept their friendship .
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 12]: `` Would you like to have a row on the water ?
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 26]: It is a beautiful day , and if Mrs Wharncliffe will trust herself -- '' `` Oh , I should like it above all things .
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 4]: Will you go .
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 2]: William ?
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 8]: I will run for a shawl . ''
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 20]: In a few minutes we were all three embarked , and I rowed them to _ my villa _ .
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 17]: They had been admiring the beauty of the various residences on the banks of the Thames .
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 9]: `` How do you like that one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 6]: inquired I of Mrs Wharncliffe .
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 16]: `` It is very handsome , and I think one of the very best . ''
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 20]: `` That is mine , '' replied I. `` Will you allow me to show it to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 4]: `` Yours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 20]: `` Yes , mine ; but I have a very small establishment , for I am a bachelor . ''
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 14]: We landed , and after walking about the grounds went into the house .
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 8]: `` Do you recollect this room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 6]: said I to Mr Wharncliffe .
Parsing [sent. 7017 len. 35]: `` Yes , indeed I do ; it was here that the box was opened , and my uncle 's -- But we must not say anything about that : he is dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7018 len. 4]: `` Dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 15]: `` Yes ; he never held his head up after his dishonesty was discovered .
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 16]: He pined and died within three months , sincerely repenting what he had attempted . ''
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 30]: I accepted their invitation to dinner , as I rowed them back to their own residence ; and afterwards had the pleasure of enrolling them among my sincerest friends .
Parsing [sent. 7022 len. 35]: Through them I was introduced to Lady Auburn and many others ; and I shall not forget the old housekeeper recognising me one day , when I was invited to Lady Auburn 's villa .
Parsing [sent. 7023 len. 4]: `` Bless me !
Parsing [sent. 7024 len. 8]: what tricks you young gentlemen do play .
Parsing [sent. 7025 len. 28]: Only to think how you asked me for water , and how I pushed the door in your face , and would n't let you rest yourself .
Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 23]: But if you young gentlemen will disguise yourselves , it 's your own faults , and you must take the consequences . ''
Parsing [sent. 7027 len. 16]: My acquaintances now increased rapidly , and I had the advantage of the best society .
Parsing [sent. 7028 len. 37]: I hardly need observe that it was a great advantage ; for , although I was not considered awkward , still I wanted that polish which can only be obtained by an admixture with good company .
Parsing [sent. 7029 len. 75]: The reports concerning me were various ; but it was generally believed that I was a young man who had received an excellent education , and might have been brought forward , but that I had taken a passion for the river , and had chosen to be a waterman in preference to any other employment ; that I had since come into a large fortune , and had resumed my station in society .
Parsing [sent. 7030 len. 20]: How far the false was blended with the true , those who have read my adventures will readily perceive .
Parsing [sent. 7031 len. 23]: For my part , I cared little what they said , and I gave myself no trouble to refute the various assertions .
Parsing [sent. 7032 len. 32]: I was not ashamed of my birth , because it had no effect upon the Drummonds ; still I knew the world too well to think it necessary to blazon it .
Parsing [sent. 7033 len. 55]: On the whole , the balance was in my favour ; there was a degree of romance in my history , with all its variations , which interested , and , joined to the knowledge of my actual wealth , made me to be well received , and gained me attention wherever I went .
Parsing [sent. 7034 len. 23]: One thing was much to my advantage -- my extensive reading , added to the good classical education which I had received .
Parsing [sent. 7035 len. 49]: It is not often in society that an opportunity occurs when any one can prove his acquisitions ; and thus did education turn the scale in my favour , and every one was much more inclined to believe the false rather than the true versions of my history .
Parsing [sent. 7036 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 7037 len. 56]: THE DOMINIE PROVES STAPLETON 'S `` HUMAN NATUR ' '' TO BE CORRECT -- THE RED-COAT PROVES TOO MUCH OF A MATCH FOR THE BLUE -- MARY SELLS TOM , AND TOM SELLS WHAT IS LEFT OF HIM , FOR A SHILLING -- WE NEVER KNOW THE VALUE OF ANYTHING TILL WE HAVE LOST IT .
Parsing [sent. 7038 len. 15]: I had often ruminated in what manner I could render the Dominie more comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 7039 len. 32]: I felt that to him I was as much indebted as to any living being , and one day I ventured to open the subject ; but his reply was decided .
Parsing [sent. 7040 len. 20]: `` I see , Jacob , my son , what thou wouldst wish : but it must not be .
Parsing [sent. 7041 len. 18]: Man is but a creature of habit ; habit becomes to him not only necessity but luxury .
Parsing [sent. 7042 len. 26]: For five-and-forty years have I toiled , instilling precepts and forcing knowledge into the brains of those who have never proved so apt as thou .
Parsing [sent. 7043 len. 16]: Truly , it hath been a painful task , yet can I not relinquish it .
Parsing [sent. 7044 len. 66]: I might , at one time , that is , during the first ten years , have met the offer with gratitude ; for I felt the humiliation and annoyance of wearying myself with the rudiments , when I would fain have commented upon the various peculiarities of style in the ancient Greek and Latin authors ; but now , all that has passed away .
Parsing [sent. 7045 len. 38]: The eternal round of concord , prosody , and syntax has charms for me from habit : the rule of three is preferable to the problems of Euclid , and even the Latin grammar has its delights .
Parsing [sent. 7046 len. 57]: In short , I have a _ hujus _ pleasure in _ hic , haec , hoc ; -LSB- cluck cluck ;] _ and even the flourishing of the twigs of that tree of knowledge , the birch , hath become a pleasurable occupation to me , if not to those upon whom it is inflicted .
Parsing [sent. 7047 len. 41]: I am like an old horse , who hath so long gone round and round in a mill , that he can not walk straight forward ; and , if it pleases the Almighty , I will die in harness .
Parsing [sent. 7048 len. 83]: Still I thank thee , Jacob ; and thank God that thou hast again proved the goodness of thy heart , and given me one more reason to rejoice in thee and in thy love ; but thine offer , if accepted , would not add to my happiness ; for what feeling can be more consolatory to an old man near into his grave than the reflection that his life , if not distinguished , has at least been useful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7049 len. 31]: I had not for some time received a visit from Tom ; and , surprised at this , I went down to his father 's to make inquiry about him .
Parsing [sent. 7050 len. 32]: I found the old couple sitting in-doors ; the weather was fine , but old Tom was not at his work ; even the old woman 's netting was thrown aside .
Parsing [sent. 7051 len. 6]: `` Where is Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7052 len. 9]: inquired I , after wishing them good morning .
Parsing [sent. 7053 len. 6]: `` Oh deary me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7054 len. 20]: cried the old woman , putting her apron up to her eyes ; `` that wicked good-for-nothing girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7055 len. 4]: `` Good heavens !
Parsing [sent. 7056 len. 6]: what is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7057 len. 6]: inquired I of old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 7058 len. 40]: `` The matter , Jacob , '' replied old Tom , stretching out his two wooden legs , and placing his hands upon his knees , `` is , that Tom has ` listed for a sodger . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 7059 len. 7]: ` Listed for a soldier ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7060 len. 29]: `` Yes ; that 's as sartain as it 's true ; and what 's worse , I 'm told the regiment is ordered to the West Indies .
Parsing [sent. 7061 len. 24]: So , what with fever o ' mind and yellow fever , he 's food for the land crabs , that 's sartain .
Parsing [sent. 7062 len. 39]: I think now , '' continued the old man , brushing a tear from his eye with his fore-finger , `` that I see his bones bleaching under the palisades ; for I know the place well . ''
Parsing [sent. 7063 len. 14]: `` Do n't say so , Tom ; do n't say so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7064 len. 4]: `` O Jacob !
Parsing [sent. 7065 len. 17]: beg pardon if I 'm too free now ; but ca n't you help us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7066 len. 19]: `` I will if I can , depend upon it ; but tell me how this happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 7067 len. 24]: `` Why , the long and the short of it is this : that girl , Mary Stapleton , has been his ruin .
Parsing [sent. 7068 len. 28]: When he first came home he was well received , and looked forward to being spliced and living with us ; but it did n't last long .
Parsing [sent. 7069 len. 59]: She could n't leave off her old tricks ; and so , that Tom might not get the upper hand , she plays him off with the sergeant of a recruiting party , and flies off from one to the other , just like the ticker of the old clock there does from one side to the other .
Parsing [sent. 7070 len. 17]: One day the sergeant was the fancy man , and the next day it was Tom .
Parsing [sent. 7071 len. 17]: At last Tom gets out of patience , and wishes to come to a fair understanding .
Parsing [sent. 7072 len. 44]: So he axes her whether she chooses to have the sergeant or to have him ; she might take her choice , but he had no notion of being played with in that way , after all her letters and all her promises .
Parsing [sent. 7073 len. 29]: Upon this she huffs outright , and tells Tom he may go about his business , for she did n't care if she never sees him no more .
Parsing [sent. 7074 len. 40]: So Tom 's blood was up , and he called her a damned jilt , and , in my opinion , he was near to the truth ; so then they had a regular breeze , and part company .
Parsing [sent. 7075 len. 65]: Well , this made Tom very miserable , and the next day he would have begged her pardon , and come to her terms , for , you see , Jacob , a man in love has no discretion ; but she being still angry , tells him to go about his business , as she means to marry the sergeant in a week .
Parsing [sent. 7076 len. 78]: Tom turns away again quite mad ; and it so happens that he goes into the public-house where the sergeant hangs out , hoping to be revenged on him , and meaning to have a regular set-to , and see who is the best man ; but the sergeant was n't there , and Tom takes pot after pot to drive away care ; and when the sergeant returned , Tom was not a little in liquor .
Parsing [sent. 7077 len. 57]: Now , the sergeant was a knowing chap , and when he comes in , and perceives Tom with his face flushed , he guesses what was to come , so , instead of saying a word , he goes to another table , and dashes his fist upon it , as if in a passion .
Parsing [sent. 7078 len. 36]: Tom goes up to him , and says , ` Sergeant , I 've known that girl long before you , and if you are a man , you 'll stand up for her . '
Parsing [sent. 7079 len. 38]: ` Stand up for her ; yes , ' replied the sergeant , ` and so I would have done yesterday , but the blasted jilt has turned me to the right about and sent me away .
Parsing [sent. 7080 len. 21]: I wo n't fight now , for she wo n't have me -- any more than she will you . '
Parsing [sent. 7081 len. 72]: Now when Tom hears this , he becomes more pacified with the sergeant , and they set down like two people under the same misfortune , and take a pot together , instead of fighting ; and then , you see , the sergeant plies Tom with liquor , swearing that he will go back to the regiment , and leave Mary altogether , and advises Tom to do the same .
Parsing [sent. 7082 len. 40]: At last , what with the sergeant 's persuasions , and Tom 's desire to vex Mary , he succeeds in ` listing him , and giving him the shilling before witnesses ; that was all the rascal wanted .
Parsing [sent. 7083 len. 32]: The next day Tom was sent down to the depot , as they call it , under a guard ; and the sergeant remains here to follow up Mary without interruption .
Parsing [sent. 7084 len. 30]: This only happened three days ago , and we only were told of it yesterday by old Stapleton , who threatens to turn his daughter out of doors . ''
Parsing [sent. 7085 len. 10]: `` Ca n't you help us , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7086 len. 7]: said the old woman , crying .
Parsing [sent. 7087 len. 18]: `` I hope I can ; and if money can procure his discharge it shall be obtained .
Parsing [sent. 7088 len. 15]: But did you not say that he was ordered to the West Indies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7089 len. 29]: `` The regiment is in the Indies , but they are recruiting for it , so many have been carried off by the yellow fever last sickly season .
Parsing [sent. 7090 len. 26]: A transport , they say , will sail next week , and the recruits are to march for embarkation in three or four days . ''
Parsing [sent. 7091 len. 14]: `` And what is the regiment , and where is the depot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7092 len. 15]: `` It is the 47th Fusiliers , and the depot is at Maidstone . ''
Parsing [sent. 7093 len. 30]: `` I will lose no time , my good friends , '' replied I ; `` to-morrow I will go to Mr Drummond , and consult with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7094 len. 26]: I returned the grateful squeeze of old Tom 's hand , and , followed by the blessings of the old woman , I hastened away .
Parsing [sent. 7095 len. 101]: As I pulled up the river , for that day I was engaged to dine with the Wharncliffes , I resolved to call upon Mary Stapleton , and ascertain by her deportment whether she had become that heartless jilt which she was represented , and if so , to persuade Tom , if I succeeded in obtaining his discharge , to think no more about her ; I felt so vexed and angry with her , that after I landed , I walked about a few minutes before I went to the house , that I might recover my temper .
Parsing [sent. 7096 len. 23]: When I walked up the stairs I found Mary sitting over a sheet of paper , on which she had been writing .
Parsing [sent. 7097 len. 17]: She looked up as I came in , and I perceived that she had been crying .
Parsing [sent. 7098 len. 24]: `` Mary , '' said I , `` how well you have kept the promise you made to me when last we met !
Parsing [sent. 7099 len. 15]: See what trouble and sorrow you have brought upon all parties except yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 7100 len. 41]: `` Except myself -- no , Mr Faithful , do n't except myself , I am almost mad -- I believe that I am mad -- for surely such folly as mine is madness ; '' and Mary wept bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 7101 len. 16]: `` There is no excuse for your behaviour , Mary -- it is unpardonably wicked .
Parsing [sent. 7102 len. 19]: Tom sacrificed all for your sake -- he even deserted , and desertion is death by the law .
Parsing [sent. 7103 len. 6]: Now what have you done ?
Parsing [sent. 7104 len. 26]: -- taken advantage of his strong affection to drive him to intemperance , and induce him , in despair , to enlist for a soldier .
Parsing [sent. 7105 len. 38]: He sails for the West Indies to fill up the ranks of a regiment thinned by the yellow fever , and will perhaps never return again -- you will then have been the occasion of his death .
Parsing [sent. 7106 len. 14]: Mary , I have come to tell you that I despise you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7107 len. 22]: `` I despise and hate myself , '' replied Mary , mournfully ; `` I wish I were in my grave .
Parsing [sent. 7108 len. 16]: Oh , Mr Faithful , do for God 's sake -- do get him back .
Parsing [sent. 7109 len. 15]: You can , I know you can -- you have money and everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 7110 len. 24]: `` If I do , it will not be for your benefit , Mary , for you shall trifle with him no more .
Parsing [sent. 7111 len. 19]: I will not try for his discharge unless he faithfully promises never to speak to you again . ''
Parsing [sent. 7112 len. 14]: `` You do n't say that -- you do n't mean that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7113 len. 27]: cried Mary , sweeping the hair with her hand back from her forehead -- and her hand still remaining on her head -- `` O God !
Parsing [sent. 7114 len. 3]: O God !
Parsing [sent. 7115 len. 6]: what a wretch I am !
Parsing [sent. 7116 len. 61]: Hear me , Jacob , hear me , '' cried she , dropping on her knees , and seizing my hands ; `` only get him his discharge -- only let me once see him again , and I swear by all that 's sacred , that I will beg his pardon on my knees as I now do yours .
Parsing [sent. 7117 len. 27]: I will do everything -- anything -- if he will but forgive me , for I can not , I will not live without him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7118 len. 22]: `` If this is true , Mary , what madness could have induced you to have acted as you have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7119 len. 33]: `` Yes , '' replied Mary , rising from her knees , `` madness , indeed -- more than madness to treat so cruelly one for whom I only care to live .
Parsing [sent. 7120 len. 22]: You say Tom loves me ; I know he does ; but he does not love me as I do him .
Parsing [sent. 7121 len. 5]: O , my God !
Parsing [sent. 7122 len. 6]: my heart will break ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7123 len. 7]: After a pause , Mary resumed .
Parsing [sent. 7124 len. 19]: `` Read what I have written to him -- I have already written as much in another letter .
Parsing [sent. 7125 len. 41]: You will see that if he can not get away , I have offered to go out with him as his wife ; that is , if he will have such a foolish , wicked girl as I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 7126 len. 29]: I read the letter ; it was as she said , praying forgiveness , offering to accompany him , and humiliating herself as much as it was possible .
Parsing [sent. 7127 len. 5]: I was much affected .
Parsing [sent. 7128 len. 5]: I returned the letter .
Parsing [sent. 7129 len. 28]: `` You ca n't despise me so much as I despise myself , '' continued Mary ; `` I hate , I detest myself for my folly .
Parsing [sent. 7130 len. 13]: I recollect now how you used to caution me when a girl .
Parsing [sent. 7131 len. 24]: Oh , mother , mother , it was a cruel legacy you left to your child , when you gave her your disposition .
Parsing [sent. 7132 len. 7]: Yet why should I blame her ?
Parsing [sent. 7133 len. 6]: I must blame myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 7134 len. 19]: `` Well , Mary , I will do all I can , and that as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 7135 len. 10]: To-morrow I will go down to the depot . ''
Parsing [sent. 7136 len. 26]: `` God bless you , Jacob ; and may you never have the misfortune to be in love with such a one as myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 7137 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 7138 len. 34]: I AM MADE VERY HAPPY -- IN OTHER RESPECTS A VERY MELANCHOLY CHAPTER , WHICH , WE ARE SORRY TO INFORM THE READER , WILL BE FOLLOWED UP BY ONE STILL MORE SO .
Parsing [sent. 7139 len. 12]: I left Mary , and hastened home to dress for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 7140 len. 41]: I mentioned the subject of wishing to obtain Tom 's discharge to Mr Wharncliffe , who recommended my immediately applying to the Horse Guards ; and , as he was acquainted with those in office , offered to accompany me .
Parsing [sent. 7141 len. 23]: I gladly accepted his offer ; and the next morning he called for me in his carriage , and we went there .
Parsing [sent. 7142 len. 25]: Mr Wharncliffe sent up his card to one of the secretaries , and we were immediately ushered up , when I stated my wishes .
Parsing [sent. 7143 len. 59]: The reply was : -- `` If you had time to procure a substitute it would be easily arranged ; but the regiment is so weak , and the aversion to the West Indies so prevalent after this last very sickly season , that I doubt if His Royal Highness would permit any man to purchase his discharge .
Parsing [sent. 7144 len. 6]: However , we will see .
Parsing [sent. 7145 len. 19]: The Duke is one of the kindest-hearted of men , and I will lay the case before him .
Parsing [sent. 7146 len. 18]: But let us see if he is still at the depot ; I rather think not . ''
Parsing [sent. 7147 len. 6]: The secretary rang the bell .
Parsing [sent. 7148 len. 15]: `` The detachment of the 47th Fusiliers from the depot -- has it marched ?
Parsing [sent. 7149 len. 7]: And when does it embark ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7150 len. 19]: The clerk went out , and in a few minutes returned with some a papers in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 7151 len. 26]: `` It marched the day before yesterday , and was to embark this morning , and sail as soon as the wind was fair . ''
Parsing [sent. 7152 len. 7]: My heart sank at this intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 7153 len. 10]: `` How is the wind , Mr G -- ?
Parsing [sent. 7154 len. 9]: Go down and look at the tell-tale . ''
Parsing [sent. 7155 len. 4]: The clerk returned .
Parsing [sent. 7156 len. 17]: `` East North East , sir , and has been steadily so these two days . ''
Parsing [sent. 7157 len. 21]: `` Then , '' replied the secretary , `` I am afraid you are too late to obtain your wish .
Parsing [sent. 7158 len. 29]: The orders to the port-admiral are most peremptory to expedite the sailing of the transports , and a frigate has been now three weeks waiting to convoy them .
Parsing [sent. 7159 len. 10]: Depend upon it , they have sailed to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 7160 len. 7]: `` What can be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7161 len. 5]: replied I , mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 7162 len. 13]: `` You must apply for his discharge , and procure a substitute .
Parsing [sent. 7163 len. 16]: He can then have an order sent out , and be permitted to return home .
Parsing [sent. 7164 len. 23]: I am very sorry , as I perceive you are much interested ; but I 'm afraid it is too late now .
Parsing [sent. 7165 len. 7]: However , you may call to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 7166 len. 22]: The weather is clear with this wind , and the port-admiral will telegraph to the Admiralty the sailing of the vessels .
Parsing [sent. 7167 len. 33]: Should anything detain them , I will take care that His Royal Highness shall be acquainted with the circumstances this afternoon , if possible , and will give you his reply . ''
Parsing [sent. 7168 len. 13]: We thanked the secretary for his politeness , and took our leave .
Parsing [sent. 7169 len. 60]: Vexed as I was with the communications I had already received , I was much more so when one of the porters ran to the carriage to show me , by the secretary 's order , a telegraphic communication from the Admiralty , containing the certain and unpleasant information , `` Convoy to West Indies sailed this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 7170 len. 55]: `` Then it is all over for the present , '' said I , throwing myself back in the carriage ; and I continued in a melancholy humour until Mr Wharncliffe , who had business in the city , put me down as near as the carriage went to the house of Mr Drummond .
Parsing [sent. 7171 len. 32]: I found Sarah , who was the depository of all my thoughts , pains , and pleasures , and I communicated to her this episode in the history of young Tom .
Parsing [sent. 7172 len. 35]: As most ladies are severe judges of their own sex , she was very strong in her expressions against the conduct of Mary , which she would not allow to admit of any palliation .
Parsing [sent. 7173 len. 9]: Even her penitence had no weight with her .
Parsing [sent. 7174 len. 42]: `` And yet , how often is it the case , Sarah , not perhaps to the extent carried on by this mistaken girl ; but still , the disappointment is as great , although the consequences are not so calamitous .
Parsing [sent. 7175 len. 27]: Among the higher classes , how often do young men receive encouragement , and yield themselves up to a passion , to end only in disappointment !
Parsing [sent. 7176 len. 53]: It is not necessary to plight troth ; a young woman may not have virtually committed herself , and yet , by merely appearing pleased with the conversation and company of a young man , induce him to venture his affections in a treacherous sea , and eventually find them wrecked . ''
Parsing [sent. 7177 len. 13]: `` You are very nautically poetical , Jacob , '' replied Sarah .
Parsing [sent. 7178 len. 27]: `` Such things do happen ; but I think that women 's affections are , to use your phrase , oftener wrecked than those of men .
Parsing [sent. 7179 len. 10]: That , however , does not exculpate either party .
Parsing [sent. 7180 len. 44]: A woman must be blind , indeed , if she can not perceive , in a very short time , whether she is trifling with a man 's feelings , and base , indeed , if she continues to practise upon them . ''
Parsing [sent. 7181 len. 11]: `` Sarah , '' replied I , and I stopped .
Parsing [sent. 7182 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7183 len. 25]: `` I was , '' replied I , stammering a little -- `` I was going to ask you if you were blind . ''
Parsing [sent. 7184 len. 8]: `` As to what , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7185 len. 6]: said Sarah , colouring up .
Parsing [sent. 7186 len. 9]: `` As to my feelings towards you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7187 len. 17]: `` No ; I believe you like me very well , '' replied she , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 7188 len. 10]: `` Do you think that that is all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7189 len. 13]: `` Where do you dine to-day , Jacob , '' replied Sarah .
Parsing [sent. 7190 len. 10]: `` That must depend upon you and your answer .
Parsing [sent. 7191 len. 13]: If I dine here to-day , I trust to dine here often .
Parsing [sent. 7192 len. 14]: If I do not dine here to-day , probably I never may again .
Parsing [sent. 7193 len. 49]: I wish to know , Sarah , whether you have been blind to my feelings towards you ; for , with the case of Mary and Tom before me , I feel that I must no longer trust to my own hopes , which may end in disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 7194 len. 14]: Will you have the kindness to put me out of my misery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7195 len. 20]: `` If I have been blind to your feelings I have not been blind to your merit , Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 7196 len. 22]: Perhaps I have not been blind to your feelings , and I am not of the same disposition as Mary Stapleton .
Parsing [sent. 7197 len. 26]: I think you may venture to dine here to-day , '' continued she , colouring and smiling , as she turned away to the window .
Parsing [sent. 7198 len. 21]: `` I can hardly believe that I 'm to be so happy , Sarah , '' replied I , agitated .
Parsing [sent. 7199 len. 37]: `` I have been fortunate , very fortunate ; but the hopes you have now raised are so much beyond my expectations -- so much beyond my deserts -- that I dare not indulge in them .
Parsing [sent. 7200 len. 11]: Have pity on me , and be more explicit . ''
Parsing [sent. 7201 len. 10]: `` What do you wish me to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7202 len. 16]: replied Sarah , looking down upon her work , as she turned round to me .
Parsing [sent. 7203 len. 48]: `` That you will not reject the orphan who was fostered by your father , and who reminds you of what he was , that you may not forget at this moment what I trust is the greatest bar to his presumption -- his humble origin . ''
Parsing [sent. 7204 len. 29]: `` Jacob , that was said like yourself -- it was nobly said ; and if you were not born noble , you have true nobility of mind .
Parsing [sent. 7205 len. 6]: I will imitate your example .
Parsing [sent. 7206 len. 18]: Have I not often , during our long friendship , told you that I loved you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7207 len. 12]: `` Yes , as a child you did , Sarah . ''
Parsing [sent. 7208 len. 11]: `` Then , as a woman , I repeat it .
Parsing [sent. 7209 len. 7]: And now are you satisfied ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7210 len. 24]: I took Sarah by the hand ; she did not withdraw it , but allowed me to kiss it over and over again .
Parsing [sent. 7211 len. 10]: `` But your father and mother , Sarah ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7212 len. 21]: `` Would never have allowed our intimacy if they had not approved of it , Jacob , depend upon it .
Parsing [sent. 7213 len. 33]: However , you may make yourself easy on that score by letting them know what has passed ; and then , I presume , you will be out of your misery . ''
Parsing [sent. 7214 len. 36]: Before the day was over I had spoken to Mrs Drummond , and requested her to open the business to her husband , as I really felt it more than I could dare to do .
Parsing [sent. 7215 len. 65]: She smiled as her daughter hung upon her neck ; and when I met Mr Drummond at dinner-time I was `` out of my misery , '' for he shook me by the hand , and said , `` You have made us all very happy , Jacob ; for that girl appears determined either to marry you or not to marry at all .
Parsing [sent. 7216 len. 7]: Come ; dinner is ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 7217 len. 85]: I will leave the reader to imagine how happy I was , what passed between Sarah and me in our _ tete-a-tete _ of that evening , how unwilling I was to quit the house , and how I ordered a post-chaise to carry me home , because I was afraid to trust myself on that water on which the major part of my life had been safely passed , lest any accident should happen to me and rob me of my anticipated bliss .
Parsing [sent. 7218 len. 32]: From that day I was as one of the family , and finding the distance too great , took up my abode at apartments contiguous to the house of Mr Drummond .
Parsing [sent. 7219 len. 26]: But the course of other people 's love did not run so smooth , and I must now return to Mary Stapleton and Tom Beazeley .
Parsing [sent. 7220 len. 28]: I had breakfasted , and was just about to take my wherry and go down to acquaint the old couple with the bad success of my application .
Parsing [sent. 7221 len. 88]: I had been reflecting with gratitude upon my own happiness in prospect , indulging in fond anticipations , and then , reverting to the state in which I had left Mary Stapleton and Tom 's father and mother , contrasting their misery with my joy , arising from the same source , when , who should rush into the dining-room but young Tom , dressed in nothing but a shirt and a pair of white trousers , covered with dust , and wan with fatigue and excitement .
Parsing [sent. 7222 len. 4]: `` Good heavens !
Parsing [sent. 7223 len. 2]: Tom !
Parsing [sent. 7224 len. 4]: are you back ?
Parsing [sent. 7225 len. 7]: then you must have deserted . ''
Parsing [sent. 7226 len. 32]: `` Very true , '' replied Tom , sinking on a chair , `` I swam on shore last night , and have made from Portsmouth to here since eight o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 7227 len. 10]: I hardly need say that I am done up .
Parsing [sent. 7228 len. 12]: Let me have something to drink , Jacob , pray . ''
Parsing [sent. 7229 len. 20]: I went to the cellaret and brought him some wine , of which he drank off a tumbler eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 7230 len. 20]: During this I was revolving in my mind the consequences which might arise from this hasty and imprudent step .
Parsing [sent. 7231 len. 17]: `` Tom , '' said I , `` do you know the consequences of desertion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7232 len. 17]: `` Yes , '' replied he , gloomily , `` but I could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 7233 len. 30]: Mary told me in her letter that she would do all I wished , would accompany me abroad ; she made all the amends she could , poor girl !
Parsing [sent. 7234 len. 64]: and , by heavens , I could not leave her ; and when I found myself fairly under weigh , and there was no chance , I was almost mad ; the wind baffled us at the Needles , and we anchored for the night ; I slipped down the cable and swam on shore , and there 's the whole story . ''
Parsing [sent. 7235 len. 18]: `` But , Tom , you will certainly be recognised and taken up for a deserter . ''
Parsing [sent. 7236 len. 33]: `` I must think of that , '' replied Tom ; `` I know the risk I run ; but if you obtain my discharge , they may let me off . ''
Parsing [sent. 7237 len. 26]: I thought this was the best plan to proceed upon , and requesting Tom to keep quiet , I went to consult with Mr Wharncliffe .
Parsing [sent. 7238 len. 36]: He agreed with me that it was Tom 's only chance , and I pulled to his father 's , to let them know what had occurred , and then went on to the Drummonds .
Parsing [sent. 7239 len. 22]: When I returned home late in the evening the gardener told me that Tom had gone out and had not returned .
Parsing [sent. 7240 len. 29]: My heart misgave me that he had gone to see Mary , and that some misfortune had occurred , and I went to bed with most anxious feelings .
Parsing [sent. 7241 len. 23]: My forebodings were proved to be correct , for the next morning I was informed that old Stapleton wished to see me .
Parsing [sent. 7242 len. 39]: He was ushered in , and as soon as he entered , he exclaimed , `` All 's up , Master Jacob -- Tom 's nabbed -- Mary fit after fit -- _ human natur ' _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 7243 len. 13]: `` Why , what _ is _ the matter , Stapleton ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7244 len. 15]: `` Why , it 's just this -- Tom desarts to come to Mary .
Parsing [sent. 7245 len. 3]: Cause why ?
Parsing [sent. 7246 len. 9]: -- he loves her -- human natur ' .
Parsing [sent. 7247 len. 20]: That soldier chap comes in and sees Tom , clutches hold , and tries to take possession of him .
Parsing [sent. 7248 len. 19]: Tom fights , knocks out sergeant 's starboard eye , and tries to escape -- human natur ' .
Parsing [sent. 7249 len. 16]: Soldiers come in , pick up sergeant , seize Tom , and carry him off .
Parsing [sent. 7250 len. 30]: Mary cries , and screams , and faints -- human natur ' -- poor girl ca n't keep her head up -- two women with burnt feathers all night .
Parsing [sent. 7251 len. 6]: Sad job , Mister Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 7252 len. 49]: Of all the senses love 's the worst , that 's sartain -- quite upset me , ca n't smoke my pipe this morning -- Mary 's tears quite put my pipe out , '' -- and old Stapleton looked as if he was ready to cry himself .
Parsing [sent. 7253 len. 28]: `` This is a sad business , Stapleton , '' replied I. `` Tom will be tried for desertion , and God knows how it will end .
Parsing [sent. 7254 len. 16]: I will try all I can ; but they have been very strict lately . ''
Parsing [sent. 7255 len. 8]: `` Hope you will , Mister Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 7256 len. 8]: Mary will die , that 's sartain .
Parsing [sent. 7257 len. 8]: I 'm more afraid that Tom will .
Parsing [sent. 7258 len. 9]: If one does , t ` other will .
Parsing [sent. 7259 len. 26]: I know the girl -- just like her mother , never could carry her helm amidships , hard a port , or hard a starboard .
Parsing [sent. 7260 len. 13]: She 's mad now to follow him -- will go to Maidstone .
Parsing [sent. 7261 len. 12]: I take her as soon as I go back to her .
Parsing [sent. 7262 len. 11]: Just come up to tell you all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7263 len. 10]: `` This is a gloomy affair , Stapleton . ''
Parsing [sent. 7264 len. 21]: `` Yes , for sartain -- wish there never was such a thing as _ human natur ' _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 7265 len. 33]: After a little conversation , and a supply of money , which I knew would be acceptable , Stapleton went away , leaving , me in no very happy state of mind .
Parsing [sent. 7266 len. 15]: My regard for Tom was excessive , and his situation one of peculiar danger .
Parsing [sent. 7267 len. 17]: Again I repaired to Mr Wharncliffe for advice , and he readily interested himself most warmly .
Parsing [sent. 7268 len. 28]: `` This is , indeed , an awkward business , '' said he , `` and will require more interest than I am afraid that I command .
Parsing [sent. 7269 len. 35]: If not condemned to death , he will be sentenced to such a flogging as will break him down in spirit as well as in body , and sink him into an early grave .
Parsing [sent. 7270 len. 7]: Death were preferable of the two .
Parsing [sent. 7271 len. 21]: Lose no time , Mr Faithful , in going down to Maidstone , and seeing the colonel commanding the depot .
Parsing [sent. 7272 len. 17]: I will go to the Horse Guards , and see what is to be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 7273 len. 18]: I wrote a hurried note to Sarah to account for my absence , and sent for post-horses .
Parsing [sent. 7274 len. 26]: Early in the afternoon I arrived at Maidstone , and finding out the residence of the officer commanding the depot , sent up my card .
Parsing [sent. 7275 len. 15]: In few words I stated to him the reason of my calling upon him .
Parsing [sent. 7276 len. 25]: `` It will rest altogether with the Horse Guards , Mr Faithful , and I am afraid I can give you but little hope .
Parsing [sent. 7277 len. 20]: His Royal Highness has expressed his determination to punish the next deserter with the utmost severity of the law .
Parsing [sent. 7278 len. 21]: His leniency on that point has been very injurious to the service , and he _ must do it _ .
Parsing [sent. 7279 len. 24]: Besides , there is an aggravation of the offence in his attack upon the sergeant , who has irrecoverably lost his eye . ''
Parsing [sent. 7280 len. 16]: `` The sergeant first made him drunk , and then persuaded him to enlist . ''
Parsing [sent. 7281 len. 33]: I then stated the rivalship that subsisted between them , and continued , `` Is it not disgraceful to enlist men in that way -- can that be called voluntary service ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7282 len. 19]: `` All very true , '' replied the officer , `` but still expediency winks at even more .
Parsing [sent. 7283 len. 15]: I do not attempt to defend the system , but we must have soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 7284 len. 35]: The seamen are impressed by force , the soldiers are entrapped by other means , even more discreditable : the only excuse is expediency , or , if you like it better , necessity .
Parsing [sent. 7285 len. 40]: All I can promise you , sir , is , to allow the prisoner every comfort which his situation will permit , and every advantage at his court-martial , which mercy , tempered by justice , will warrant . ''
Parsing [sent. 7286 len. 19]: `` I thank you , sir ; will you allow me and his betrothed to see him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7287 len. 12]: `` Most certainly ; the order shall be given forthwith . ''
Parsing [sent. 7288 len. 13]: I thanked the officer for his kindness , and took my leave .
Parsing [sent. 7289 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 7290 len. 3]: READ IT .
Parsing [sent. 7291 len. 36]: I hastened to the black hole where Tom was confined , and the order for my admission having arrived before me , I was permitted by the sergeant of the guard to pass the sentry .
Parsing [sent. 7292 len. 19]: I found Tom sitting on a bench notching a stick with his knife , whistling a slow tune .
Parsing [sent. 7293 len. 29]: `` This is kind , Jacob , but not more than I expected of you -- I made sure that I should see you to-night or to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 7294 len. 5]: How 's poor Mary ?
Parsing [sent. 7295 len. 34]: I care only for her now -- I am satisfied -- she loves me , and -- I knocked out the sergeant 's eye -- spoilt his wooing , at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 7296 len. 18]: `` But , Tom , are you aware of the danger in which you are placed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7297 len. 17]: `` Yes , Jacob , perfectly ; I shall be tried by a court-martial and shot .
Parsing [sent. 7298 len. 32]: I 've made up my mind to it -- at all events , it 's better than being hung like a dog , or being flogged to death like a nigger .
Parsing [sent. 7299 len. 20]: I shall die like a gentleman , if I have never been one before , that 's some comfort .
Parsing [sent. 7300 len. 29]: Nay , I shall go out of the world with as much noise as if a battle had been fought , or a great man had died . ''
Parsing [sent. 7301 len. 7]: `` How do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7302 len. 13]: `` Why there 'll be more than one _ bullet-in _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 7303 len. 11]: `` This is no time for jesting , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 7304 len. 41]: `` Not for you , Jacob , as a sincere friend , I grant ; not for poor Mary , as a devoted girl ; not for my poor father and mother -- no , no , '' continued Tom .
Parsing [sent. 7305 len. 15]: `` I feel for them , but for myself I neither fear nor care .
Parsing [sent. 7306 len. 21]: I have not done wrong -- I was pressed against the law and Act of Parliament , and I deserted .
Parsing [sent. 7307 len. 14]: I was enlisted when I was drunk and mad , and I deserted .
Parsing [sent. 7308 len. 18]: There is no disgrace to me ; the disgrace is to the government which suffers such acts .
Parsing [sent. 7309 len. 19]: If I am to be a victim , well and good -- we can only die once . ''
Parsing [sent. 7310 len. 22]: `` Very true , Tom ; but you are young to die , and we must hope for the best . ''
Parsing [sent. 7311 len. 10]: `` I have given up all hope , Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 7312 len. 10]: I know the law will be put in force .
Parsing [sent. 7313 len. 48]: I shall die and go to another and a better world , as the parson says , where , at all events , there will be no muskets to clean , no drill , and none of your confounded pipe-clay , which has almost driven me mad .
Parsing [sent. 7314 len. 45]: I should like to die in a blue jacket -- in a red coat I will not , so I presume I shall go out of the world in my shirt , and that 's more than I had when I came in . ''
Parsing [sent. 7315 len. 14]: `` Mary and her father are coming down to you , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 7316 len. 34]: `` I 'm sorry for that , Jacob ; it would be cruel not to see her -- but she blames herself so much that I can not bear to read her letters .
Parsing [sent. 7317 len. 56]: But , Jacob , I will see her , to try if I can comfort her -- but she must not stay ; she must go back again till after the court-martial , and the sentence , and then -- if she wishes to take her farewell , I suppose I must not refuse . ''
Parsing [sent. 7318 len. 12]: A few tears dropped from his eyes as he said this .
Parsing [sent. 7319 len. 13]: `` Jacob , will you wait and take her back to town ?
Parsing [sent. 7320 len. 20]: -- she must not stay here -- and I will not see my father and mother until the last .
Parsing [sent. 7321 len. 16]: Let us make one job of it , and then all will be over . ''
Parsing [sent. 7322 len. 19]: As Tom said this the door of the cell again opened , and Stapleton supported in his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 7323 len. 18]: Mary tottered to where Tom stood , and fell into his arms in a fit of convulsions .
Parsing [sent. 7324 len. 13]: It was necessary to remove her , and she was carried out .
Parsing [sent. 7325 len. 27]: `` Let her not come in again , I beseech you , Jacob ; take her back , and I will bless you for your kindness .
Parsing [sent. 7326 len. 15]: Wish me farewell now , and see that she does not come again . ''
Parsing [sent. 7327 len. 15]: Tom wrung me by the hand , and turned away to conceal his distress .
Parsing [sent. 7328 len. 27]: I nodded my head in assent , for I could not speak for emotion , and followed Stapleton and the soldiers who had taken Mary out .
Parsing [sent. 7329 len. 31]: As soon as she was recovered sufficiently to require no further medical aid , I lifted her into the post-chaise , and ordered the boys to drive back to Brentford .
Parsing [sent. 7330 len. 40]: Mary continued in a state of stupor during the journey ; and when I arrived at my own house , I gave her into the charge of the gardener 's wife , and despatched her husband for medical assistance .
Parsing [sent. 7331 len. 21]: The application of Mr Wharncliffe was of little avail , and he returned to me with disappointment in his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 7332 len. 99]: The whole of the next week was the most distressing that I ever passed ; arising from my anxiety for Tom , my daily exertions to reason Mary into some degree of submission to the will of Providence -- her accusations of herself and her own folly -- her incoherent ravings , calling herself Tom 's murderer , which alarmed me for her reason ; the distress of old Tom and his wife , who , unable to remain in their solitude , came all to me for intelligence , for comfort , and for what , alas !
Parsing [sent. 7333 len. 8]: I dare not give them -- hope .
Parsing [sent. 7334 len. 38]: All this , added to my separation from Sarah during my attendance to what I considered my duty , reduced me to a debility , arising from mental exertion , which changed me to almost a skeleton .
Parsing [sent. 7335 len. 14]: At last the court-martial was held , and Tom was condemned to death .
Parsing [sent. 7336 len. 17]: The sentence was approved of , and we were told that all appeals would be unavailing .
Parsing [sent. 7337 len. 19]: We received the news on the Saturday evening , and Tom was to suffer on the Tuesday morning .
Parsing [sent. 7338 len. 37]: I could no longer refuse the appeals of Mary ; indeed , I received a letter from Tom , requesting that all of us , the Dominie included , would come down and bid him farewell .
Parsing [sent. 7339 len. 38]: I hired a carriage for old Tom , his wife , Stapleton , and Mary , and putting the Dominie and myself in my own chariot , we set off early on the Sunday morning for Maidstone .
Parsing [sent. 7340 len. 19]: We arrived about eleven o'clock , and put up at an inn in close proximity to the barracks .
Parsing [sent. 7341 len. 25]: It was arranged that the Dominie and I should see Tom first , then his father and mother , and lastly , Mary Stapleton .
Parsing [sent. 7342 len. 46]: `` Verily , '' said the Dominie , `` my heart is heavy , exceeding heavy ; my soul yearneth after the poor lad , who is thus to lose his life for a woman -- a woman from whose toils I did myself escape .
Parsing [sent. 7343 len. 21]: Yet is she exceeding fair and comely , and now that it is unavailing , appeareth to be penitent . ''
Parsing [sent. 7344 len. 15]: I made no reply ; we had arrived at the gate of the barracks .
Parsing [sent. 7345 len. 15]: I requested to be admitted to the prisoner , and the doors were unbarred .
Parsing [sent. 7346 len. 31]: Tom was dressed with great care and cleanliness in white trousers and shirt and waistcoat , but his coat lay on the table ; he would not put it on .
Parsing [sent. 7347 len. 11]: He extended his hand towards me with a faint smile .
Parsing [sent. 7348 len. 44]: `` It 's all over now , Jacob ; and there is no hope that I am aware of , and I have made up my mind to die ; but I wish these last farewells were over , for they unman me .
Parsing [sent. 7349 len. 15]: I hope you are well , sir , '' continued Tom to the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 7350 len. 51]: `` Nay , my poor boy , I am as well as age and infirmity will permit , and why should I complain when I see youth , health , and strength about to be sacrificed ; and many made miserable , when many might be made so happy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7351 len. 29]: And the Dominie blew his nose , the trumpet sound of which re-echoed through the cell , so as to induce the sentry to look through the bars .
Parsing [sent. 7352 len. 21]: `` They are all here , Tom , '' said I. `` Would you like to see them now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7353 len. 12]: `` Yes ; the sooner it is over the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 7354 len. 11]: `` Will you see your father and mother first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7355 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' replied Tom , in a faltering tone .
Parsing [sent. 7356 len. 30]: I went out , and returned with the old woman on my arm , followed by old Tom , who stumped after me with the assistance of his stick .
Parsing [sent. 7357 len. 14]: Poor old Mrs Beazeley fell on her son 's neck , sobbing convulsively .
Parsing [sent. 7358 len. 14]: `` My boy -- my boy -- my dear , dear boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7359 len. 14]: said she at last , and she looked up steadfastly in his face .
Parsing [sent. 7360 len. 4]: `` My God !
Parsing [sent. 7361 len. 7]: he 'll be dead to-morrow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7362 len. 15]: Her head again sank on his shoulder , and her sobs were choking her .
Parsing [sent. 7363 len. 22]: Tom kissed his mother 's forehead as the tears coursed down his cheeks , and motioned me to take her away .
Parsing [sent. 7364 len. 31]: I placed her down on the floor , where she remained silent , moving her head up and down with a slow motion , her face buried in her shawl .
Parsing [sent. 7365 len. 16]: It was but now and then that you heard a convulsive drawing of her breath .
Parsing [sent. 7366 len. 13]: Old Tom had remained a silent but agitated spectator of the scene .
Parsing [sent. 7367 len. 25]: Every muscle in his weather-beaten countenance twitched convulsively , and the tears at last forced their way through the deep furrows on his cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 7368 len. 23]: Tom , as soon as his mother was removed , took his father by the hand , and they sat down together .
Parsing [sent. 7369 len. 14]: `` You are not angry with me , father , for deserting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7370 len. 22]: `` No , my boy , no ; I was angry with you for ` listing , but not for deserting .
Parsing [sent. 7371 len. 8]: What business had you with the pipeclay ?
Parsing [sent. 7372 len. 40]: But I do think I have reason to be angry elsewhere , when I reflect that after having lost my two legs in defending her , my country is now to take from me my boy in his prime .
Parsing [sent. 7373 len. 25]: It 's but a poor reward for long and hard service -- poor encouragement to do your duty ; but what do they care ?
Parsing [sent. 7374 len. 14]: they have had my sarvices , and they have left me a hulk .
Parsing [sent. 7375 len. 89]: Well , they may take the rest of me if they please , now that they -- Well , it 's no use crying ; what 's done ca n't be helped , '' continued old Tom , as the tears ran down in torrents ; `` they may shoot you , Tom ; but this I know well , you 'll die game , and shame them by proving to them they have deprived themselves of the sarvices of a good man when good men are needed .
Parsing [sent. 7376 len. 117]: I would not have so much cared , '' continued old Tom , after a pause -- '' -LRB- look to the old woman , Jacob , she 's tumbling over to port -RRB- -- if you had fallen on board a king 's ship in a good frigate action ; some must be killed when there 's hard fighting ; but to be drilled through by your own countrymen , to die by their hands , and , worst of all , to die in a red coat , instead of a true blue -- '' `` Father , I will not die in a red coat -- I wo n't put it on . ''
Parsing [sent. 7377 len. 16]: `` That 's some comfort , Tom , anyhow , and comfort 's wanted . ''
Parsing [sent. 7378 len. 12]: `` And I 'll die like a man , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 7379 len. 14]: `` That you will , Tom , and that 's some comfort . ''
Parsing [sent. 7380 len. 9]: `` We shall meet again , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 7381 len. 15]: `` Hope so , Tom , in heaven -- that 's some comfort . ''
Parsing [sent. 7382 len. 18]: `` And now , father , bless me , and take care of my poor mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 7383 len. 10]: `` Bless you , Tom , bless you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7384 len. 44]: cried the old man , in a suffocating voice , extending both his hands towards Tom , as they rose up ; but the equilibrium was no longer to be maintained , and he reeled back in the arms of me and Tom .
Parsing [sent. 7385 len. 31]: We lowered him gently down by the side of his wife ; the old couple turned to each other , and embracing , remained sobbing in each other 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 7386 len. 52]: `` Jacob , '' said Tom , squeezing me by the hand , with a quivering lip , `` by your regard for me , let now the last scene be got over -- let me see Mary , and let this tortured heart once more be permitted a respite . ''
Parsing [sent. 7387 len. 6]: I sent out the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 7388 len. 23]: Tom leant against the wall , with his arms folded , in appearance summoning up all his energy for the painful meeting .
Parsing [sent. 7389 len. 8]: Mary was led in by her father .
Parsing [sent. 7390 len. 54]: I expected she would have swooned away , as before ; but , on the contrary , although she was pale as death , and gasping for breath , from intensity of feeling , she walked up to Tom where he was standing , and sat down on the form close to him .
Parsing [sent. 7391 len. 73]: She looked anxiously round upon the group , and then said , `` I know that all I now say is useless , Tom ; but still I must say it -- it is I who , by my folly , have occasioned all this distress and misery -- it is I who have caused you to suffer a -- dreadful death -- yes , Tom , I am your murderer . ''
Parsing [sent. 7392 len. 20]: `` Not so , Mary , the folly was my own , '' replied Tom , taking her hand .
Parsing [sent. 7393 len. 57]: `` You can not disguise or palliate to me , dearest Tom , '' replied Mary ; `` my eyes have been opened , too late it is true , but they have been opened ; and although it is kind of you to say so , I feel the horrid conviction of my own guilt .
Parsing [sent. 7394 len. 8]: See what misery I have brought about .
Parsing [sent. 7395 len. 35]: There is a father who has sacrificed his youth and his limbs to his country , sobbing in the arms of a mother whose life is bound up with that of her only son .
Parsing [sent. 7396 len. 33]: To them , '' continued Mary , falling down upon her knees , `` to them I must kneel for pardon , and I ask it as they hope to be forgiven .
Parsing [sent. 7397 len. 5]: Answer me -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 7398 len. 3]: answer me !
Parsing [sent. 7399 len. 9]: can you forgive a wretch like me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7400 len. 4]: A pause ensued .
Parsing [sent. 7401 len. 18]: I went up to old Tom , and kneeling by his side , begged him to answer .
Parsing [sent. 7402 len. 19]: `` Forgive her , poor thing -- yes ; who could refuse it , as she kneels there ?
Parsing [sent. 7403 len. 17]: Come , '' continued he , speaking to his wife , `` you must forgive her .
Parsing [sent. 7404 len. 26]: Look up , dame , at her , and think that our poor boy may be asking the same of heaven to-morrow at noon . ''
Parsing [sent. 7405 len. 28]: The old woman looked up , and her dimmed eyes caught a sight of Mary 's imploring and beautiful attitude ; it was not to be withstood .
Parsing [sent. 7406 len. 27]: `` As I hope for mercy to my poor boy , whom you have killed , so do I forgive you , unhappy young woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 7407 len. 17]: `` May God reward you , when you are summoned before Him , '' replied Mary .
Parsing [sent. 7408 len. 9]: `` It was the hardest task of all .
Parsing [sent. 7409 len. 27]: Of you , Jacob , I have to ask forgiveness for depriving you of your early and truest friend -- yes , and for much more .
Parsing [sent. 7410 len. 29]: Of you , sir , '' addressing the Dominie , `` for my conduct towards you , which was cruel and indefensible -- will you forgive me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7411 len. 27]: `` Yes , Mary , from my heart , I do forgive you , '' replied I. `` Bless thee , maiden , bless thee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7412 len. 4]: sobbed the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 7413 len. 22]: `` Father , I must ask of you the same -- I have been a wilful child -- forgive me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7414 len. 27]: `` Yes , Mary ; you could not help it , '' replied old Stapleton , blubbering ; `` it was all human natur ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 7415 len. 37]: `` And now , '' said Mary , turning round on her knees to Tom , with a look expressive of anguish and love , `` to you , Tom , must be my last appeal .
Parsing [sent. 7416 len. 33]: I know _ you _ will forgive me -- I know you have -- and this knowledge of your fervent love makes the thought more bitter that I have caused your death .
Parsing [sent. 7417 len. 13]: But hear me , Tom , and all of you hear me .
Parsing [sent. 7418 len. 38]: I never loved but you ; I have liked others much ; I liked Jacob ; but you only ever did make me feel I had a heart ; and alas , you only have I sacrificed .
Parsing [sent. 7419 len. 33]: When led away by my folly to give you pain , I suffered more than you -- for you have had my only , you shall have my eternal and unceasing love .
Parsing [sent. 7420 len. 47]: To your memory I am hereafter wedded , to join you will be my only wish -- and if there could be a boon granted me from heaven , it would be to die with you , Tom -- yes , in those dear arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 7421 len. 32]: Mary held out her arms to Tom , who falling down on his knees , embraced her , and thus they remained with their faces buried in each other 's shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 7422 len. 115]: The whole scene was now at its climax ; it was too oppressive , and I felt faint , when I was aroused by the voice of the Dominie , who , lifting up both his arms , and extending them forth , solemnly prayed , `` O Lord , look down upon these Thy servants in affliction ; grant to those who are to continue in their pilgrimage strength to bear Thy chastening -- grant to him who is to be summoned to Thee that happiness which the world can not give ; and O God most mighty , God most powerful , lay not upon us burdens greater than we can bear .
Parsing [sent. 7423 len. 8]: -- My children let us pray . ''
Parsing [sent. 7424 len. 23]: The Dominie knelt down and repeated the Lord 's prayer ; all followed his example , and then there was a pause .
Parsing [sent. 7425 len. 11]: `` Stapleton , '' said I , pointing to Mary .
Parsing [sent. 7426 len. 6]: I beckoned to the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 7427 len. 45]: We assisted up old Tom , and then his wife , and led them away ; the poor old woman was in a state of stupefaction , and until she was out in the air was not aware that she had quitted her son .
Parsing [sent. 7428 len. 22]: Stapleton had attempted to detach Mary from Tom , but in vain ; they were locked together as if in death .
Parsing [sent. 7429 len. 39]: At last Tom , roused by me , suffered his hold to be loosened , and Mary was taken out in a happy state of insensibility , and carried to the inn by her father and the Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 7430 len. 7]: `` Are they all gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7431 len. 13]: whispered Tom to me , as his head reclined on my shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 7432 len. 6]: `` All , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 7433 len. 30]: `` Then the bitterness of death is past ; God have mercy on them , and assuage their anguish ; they want His help more than I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 7434 len. 29]: A passionate flood of tears , which lasted some minutes , relieved the poor fellow ; he raised himself , and drying his eyes , became more composed .
Parsing [sent. 7435 len. 31]: `` Jacob , I hardly need tell my dying request , to watch over my poor father and mother , to comfort poor Mary -- God bless you , Jacob !
Parsing [sent. 7436 len. 14]: you have indeed been a faithful friend , and may God reward you .
Parsing [sent. 7437 len. 20]: And now , Jacob , leave me ; I must commune with my God , and pray for forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 7438 len. 11]: The space between me and eternity is but short . ''
Parsing [sent. 7439 len. 26]: Tom threw himself into my arms , where he remained for some minutes ; he then broke gently away , and pointed to the door .
Parsing [sent. 7440 len. 10]: I once more took his hand and we parted .
Parsing [sent. 7441 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 7442 len. 46]: IN WHICH , AS USUAL IN THE LAST CHAPTER OF A WORK , EVERYTHING IS WOUND UP MUCH TO THE READER 'S SATISFACTION , AND NOT A LITTLE TO THE AUTHOR 'S , WHO LAYS DOWN HIS PEN , EXCLAIMING , `` THANK GOD ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7443 len. 30]: I went back to the inn , and ordering the horses to be put to , I explained to all but Mary the propriety of their now returning home .
Parsing [sent. 7444 len. 19]: Mary was lifted in , and it was a relief to my mind to see them all depart .
Parsing [sent. 7445 len. 27]: As for myself , I resolved to remain until the last ; but I was in a state of feverish agitation , which made me restless .
Parsing [sent. 7446 len. 15]: As I paced up and down the room , the newspaper caught my eye .
Parsing [sent. 7447 len. 12]: I laid hold of it mechanically , and looked at it .
Parsing [sent. 7448 len. 6]: A paragraph rivetted my attention .
Parsing [sent. 7449 len. 16]: `` His Majesty 's ship _ Immortalite _ Chatham , to be paid off . ''
Parsing [sent. 7450 len. 7]: Then our ship has come home .
Parsing [sent. 7451 len. 6]: But what was that now ?
Parsing [sent. 7452 len. 23]: Yet something whispered to me that I ought to go and see Captain Maclean , and try if anything could be done .
Parsing [sent. 7453 len. 31]: I knew his commanding interest , and although it was now too late , still I had an impulse to go and see him , which I could not resist .
Parsing [sent. 7454 len. 26]: `` After all , '' said I to myself , `` I 'm of no use here , and I may as well go . ''
Parsing [sent. 7455 len. 38]: This feeling , added to my restlessness , induced me to order horses , and I went to Chatham , found out that Captain Maclean was still on board , and took boat off to the frigate .
Parsing [sent. 7456 len. 32]: I was recognised by the officers , who were glad to see me , and I sent a message to the captain , who was below , requesting to see him .
Parsing [sent. 7457 len. 22]: I was asked into the cabin , and stated to him what had occurred , requesting his assistance , if possible .
Parsing [sent. 7458 len. 53]: `` Faithful , '' replied he , `` it appears that Tom Beazeley has deserted twice ; still there is much extenuation ; at all events , the punishment of death is too severe , and I do n't _ like _ it -- I can save him , and I will .
Parsing [sent. 7459 len. 27]: By the rule of the services , a deserter from one service can be claimed from the other , and must be tried by his officers .
Parsing [sent. 7460 len. 9]: His sentence is , therefore , not legal .
Parsing [sent. 7461 len. 42]: I shall send a party of marines , and claim him as a deserter from the Navy , and they must and shall give him up -- make yourself easy , Faithful , his life is as safe as yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 7462 len. 23]: I could have fallen on my knees and thanked him , though I could hardly believe that such good news was true .
Parsing [sent. 7463 len. 28]: `` There is no time to lose , sir , '' replied I , respectfully ; `` he is to be shot to-morrow at nine o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 7464 len. 19]: `` He will be on board here to-morrow at nine o'clock , or I am not Captain Maclean .
Parsing [sent. 7465 len. 13]: But , as you say , there is no time to lose .
Parsing [sent. 7466 len. 14]: It is now nearly dark , and the party must be off immediately .
Parsing [sent. 7467 len. 15]: I must write a letter on service to the commanding officer of the depot .
Parsing [sent. 7468 len. 5]: Call my clerk . ''
Parsing [sent. 7469 len. 8]: I ran out and called the clerk .
Parsing [sent. 7470 len. 26]: In a few minutes the letter was written , and a party of marines , with the second lieutenant , despatched with me on shore .
Parsing [sent. 7471 len. 16]: I ordered post-chaises for the whole party , and before eleven we were at Maidstone .
Parsing [sent. 7472 len. 46]: The lieutenant and I sat up all night , and , at daylight , we summoned the marines and went to the barracks , where we found the awful note of preparation going forward , and the commanding officer up and attending to the arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 7473 len. 12]: I introduced the lieutenant , who presented the letter on service .
Parsing [sent. 7474 len. 7]: `` Good heavens , how fortunate !
Parsing [sent. 7475 len. 10]: You can establish his identity , I presume . ''
Parsing [sent. 7476 len. 11]: `` Every man here can swear to him . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 7477 len. 7]: 'T is sufficient , Mr Faithful .
Parsing [sent. 7478 len. 11]: I wish you and your friend joy of this reprieve .
Parsing [sent. 7479 len. 20]: The rules of the service must be obeyed , and you will sign a receipt for the prisoner . ''
Parsing [sent. 7480 len. 19]: This was done by the lieutenant , and the provost marshal was ordered to deliver up the prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 7481 len. 14]: I hastened with the marines into the cell ; the door was unlocked .
Parsing [sent. 7482 len. 28]: Tom , who was reading his Bible , started up , and perceiving the red jackets , thought that he was to be led out to execution .
Parsing [sent. 7483 len. 22]: `` My lads , '' exclaimed he , `` I am ready ; the sooner this is over the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 7484 len. 18]: `` No , Tom , '' said I , advancing ; `` I trust for better fortune .
Parsing [sent. 7485 len. 13]: You are claimed as a deserter from the _ Immortalite _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 7486 len. 28]: Tom stared , lifted the hair from his forehead , and threw himself into my arms ; but we had no time for a display of feelings .
Parsing [sent. 7487 len. 33]: We hurried Tom away from the barracks ; again I put the whole party into chaises , and we soon arrived at Chatham , where we embarked on board of the frigate .
Parsing [sent. 7488 len. 28]: Tom was given into the charge of the master-at-arms as a deserter , and a letter was written by Captain Maclean , demanding a court-martial on him .
Parsing [sent. 7489 len. 8]: `` What will be the result ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7490 len. 7]: inquired I of the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 7491 len. 26]: `` The captain says , little or nothing , as he was pressed as an apprentice , which is contrary to Act of Parliament . ''
Parsing [sent. 7492 len. 24]: I went down to cheer Tom with this intelligence , and taking my leave , set off for London with a light heart .
Parsing [sent. 7493 len. 18]: Still I thought it better not to communicate this good news until assurance was made doubly sure .
Parsing [sent. 7494 len. 16]: I hastened to Mr Drummond 's , and detailed to them all that had passed .
Parsing [sent. 7495 len. 60]: The next day Mr Wharncliffe went with me to the Admiralty , where I had the happiness to find that all was legal , and that Tom could only be tried for his desertion from a man-of-war ; and that if he could prove that he was an apprentice , he would , in all probability , be acquitted .
Parsing [sent. 7496 len. 16]: The court-martial was summoned three days after the letter had been received by the Admiralty .
Parsing [sent. 7497 len. 9]: I hastened down to Chatham to be present .
Parsing [sent. 7498 len. 19]: It was very short ; the desertion was proved , and Tom was called upon for his defence .
Parsing [sent. 7499 len. 17]: He produced his papers , and proved that he was pressed before his time had expired .
Parsing [sent. 7500 len. 13]: The court was cleared for a few minutes , and then re-opened .
Parsing [sent. 7501 len. 23]: Tom was acquitted on the ground of illegal detention , contrary to Act of Parliament , and he was _ free _ .
Parsing [sent. 7502 len. 32]: I returned my thanks to Captain Maclean and his officers for their kindness , and left the ship with Tom in the cutter , ordered for me by the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 7503 len. 10]: My heart swelled with gratitude at the happy result .
Parsing [sent. 7504 len. 12]: Tom was silent , but his feelings I could well analyse .
Parsing [sent. 7505 len. 81]: I gave to the men of the boat five guineas to drink Tom 's health , and , hastening to the inn , ordered the carriage , and with Tom , who was a precious deposit , for upon his welfare depended the happiness of so many , I hurried to London as fast as I could , stopped at the Drummond 's to communicate the happy intelligence , and then proceeded to my own house , where we slept .
Parsing [sent. 7506 len. 19]: The next morning I dressed Tom in some of my clothes , and we embarked in the wherry .
Parsing [sent. 7507 len. 24]: `` Now , Tom , '' said I , `` you must keep in the background at first , while I prepare them .
Parsing [sent. 7508 len. 7]: Where shall we go first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7509 len. 11]: `` Oh , to my mother , '' replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 7510 len. 20]: We passed through Putney Bridge , and Tom 's bosom heaved as he looked towards the residence of Mary .
Parsing [sent. 7511 len. 8]: His heart was there , poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 7512 len. 23]: and he longed to fly to the poor girl and dry her tears ; but his first duty was to his parents .
Parsing [sent. 7513 len. 49]: We soon arrived abreast of the residence of the old couple , and I desired Tom to pull in , but not turn his head round , lest they should see him before I had prepared them ; for too much joy will kill as well as grief .
Parsing [sent. 7514 len. 13]: Old Tom was not at his work , and all was quiet .
Parsing [sent. 7515 len. 38]: I landed and went to the house , opened the door , and found them both sitting by the kitchen fire in silence , apparently occupied in watching the smoke as it ascended up the spacious chimney .
Parsing [sent. 7516 len. 22]: `` Good morning to you both , '' said I ; `` how do you find yourself , Mrs Beazeley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7517 len. 7]: `` Ah , deary me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7518 len. 13]: replied the old woman , putting her apron up to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7519 len. 25]: `` Sit down , Jacob , sit down , '' said old Tom ; `` we _ can _ talk of him now . ''
Parsing [sent. 7520 len. 14]: `` Yes , now that he 's in heaven , poor fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7521 len. 5]: interposed the old woman .
Parsing [sent. 7522 len. 25]: `` Tell me , Jacob , '' said old Tom , with a quivering lip , `` did you see the last of him ?
Parsing [sent. 7523 len. 6]: Tell me all about it .
Parsing [sent. 7524 len. 5]: How did he look ?
Parsing [sent. 7525 len. 5]: How did he behave ?
Parsing [sent. 7526 len. 8]: Was he soon out of his pain ?
Parsing [sent. 7527 len. 10]: And -- Jacob -- where is he buried ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7528 len. 23]: `` Yes , yes ; '' sobbed Mrs Beazeley ; `` tell me where is the body of my poor child . ''
Parsing [sent. 7529 len. 10]: `` Can you bear to talk about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7530 len. 23]: said I. `` Yes , yes ; we ca n't talk too much ; it does us good , '' replied she .
Parsing [sent. 7531 len. 15]: `` We have done nothing but talk about him since we left him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7532 len. 25]: `` And shall , till we sink down into our own graves , '' said old Tom , `` which wo n't be long .
Parsing [sent. 7533 len. 19]: I 've nothing to wish for now , and I 'll never sing again , that 's sartain .
Parsing [sent. 7534 len. 10]: We sha n't last long , either of us .
Parsing [sent. 7535 len. 20]: As for me , '' continued the old man with a melancholy smile , looking down at his stumps .
Parsing [sent. 7536 len. 17]: `` I may well say that I 've _ two _ feet in the grave already .
Parsing [sent. 7537 len. 12]: But come , Jacob , tell us all about him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7538 len. 27]: `` I will , '' replied I ; `` and my dear Mrs Beazeley , you must prepare yourself for different tidings than what you expect .
Parsing [sent. 7539 len. 7]: Tom is not yet shot . ''
Parsing [sent. 7540 len. 5]: `` Not dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7541 len. 5]: shrieked the old woman .
Parsing [sent. 7542 len. 36]: `` Not yet , Jacob ; '' cried old Tom , seizing me by the arm , and squeezing it with the force of a vice , as he looked me earnestly in the face .
Parsing [sent. 7543 len. 15]: `` He lives ; and I am in hopes he will be pardoned . ''
Parsing [sent. 7544 len. 14]: Mrs Beazeley sprang from her chair and seized me by the other arm .
Parsing [sent. 7545 len. 10]: `` I see -- I see by your face .
Parsing [sent. 7546 len. 17]: Yes , Jacob , he is pardoned ; and we shall have our Tom again . ''
Parsing [sent. 7547 len. 19]: `` You are right , Mrs Beazeley ; he is pardoned , and will soon be here . ''
Parsing [sent. 7548 len. 11]: The old couple sank down on their knees beside me .
Parsing [sent. 7549 len. 25]: I left them , and beckoned from the door to Tom , who flew up , and in a moment was in their arms .
Parsing [sent. 7550 len. 23]: I assisted him to put his mother into her chair , and then went out to recover myself from the agitating scene .
Parsing [sent. 7551 len. 11]: I remained about an hour outside , and then returned .
Parsing [sent. 7552 len. 16]: The old couple seized me by the hands , and invoked blessings on my head .
Parsing [sent. 7553 len. 26]: `` You must now part with Tom a little while , '' said I ; `` there are others to make happy besides yourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 7554 len. 19]: `` Very true , '' replied old Tom ; `` go , my lad , and comfort her .
Parsing [sent. 7555 len. 11]: Come , missus , we must n't forget others . ''
Parsing [sent. 7556 len. 5]: `` Oh , no .
Parsing [sent. 7557 len. 21]: Go , Tom ; go and tell her that I do n't care how soon she is my daughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 7558 len. 25]: Tom embraced his mother , and followed me to the boat ; we pulled up against the tide , and were soon at Putney .
Parsing [sent. 7559 len. 11]: `` Tom , you had better stay in the boat .
Parsing [sent. 7560 len. 10]: I will either come or send for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7561 len. 18]: It was very unwillingly that Tom consented , but I overruled his entreaties , and he remained .
Parsing [sent. 7562 len. 9]: I walked to Mary 's house and entered .
Parsing [sent. 7563 len. 38]: She was up in the little parlour , dressed in deep mourning ; when I entered she was looking out upon the river ; she turned her head , and perceiving me , rose to meet me .
Parsing [sent. 7564 len. 33]: `` You do not come to upbraid me , Jacob , I am sure , '' said she , in a melancholy voice ; `` you are too kind-hearted for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 7565 len. 17]: `` No , no , Mary ; I come to comfort you , if possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 7566 len. 6]: `` That is not possible .
Parsing [sent. 7567 len. 6]: Look at me , Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 7568 len. 14]: Is there not a worm -- a canker -- that gnaws within ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7569 len. 19]: The hollow cheek and wild flaring eye , once so beautiful , but too plainly told the truth .
Parsing [sent. 7570 len. 30]: `` Mary , '' said I , `` sit down ; you know what the Bible says -- ` It is good for us to be afflicted . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 7571 len. 22]: `` Yes , yes , '' sobbed Mary , `` I deserve all I suffer ; and I bow in humility .
Parsing [sent. 7572 len. 10]: But am I not too much punished , Jacob ?
Parsing [sent. 7573 len. 33]: Not that I would repine ; but is it not too much for me to bear , when I think that I am the destroyer of one who loved me so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7574 len. 11]: `` You have not been the destroyer , Mary . ''
Parsing [sent. 7575 len. 14]: `` Yes , yes ; my heart tells me that I have . ''
Parsing [sent. 7576 len. 11]: `` But -- I tell you that you have not .
Parsing [sent. 7577 len. 39]: Say , Mary , dreadful as the punishment has been , would you not kiss the rod with thankfulness , if it cured you of your unfortunate disposition , and prepared you to make a good wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7578 len. 25]: `` That it has cured me , Jacob , I can safely assert ; but it has also killed me as well as him .
Parsing [sent. 7579 len. 24]: But I wish not to live ; and I trust , in a few short months , to repose by his side . ''
Parsing [sent. 7580 len. 20]: `` I hope you will have your wish , Mary , very soon , but not in death . ''
Parsing [sent. 7581 len. 4]: `` Merciful heavens !
Parsing [sent. 7582 len. 8]: what do you mean , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7583 len. 40]: `` I said you were not the destroyer of poor Tom -- you have not been ; he has not _ yet _ suffered ; there was an informality , which has induced them to revise the sentence . ''
Parsing [sent. 7584 len. 21]: `` Jacob , '' replied Mary , `` it is cruelty to raise my hopes only to crush them again .
Parsing [sent. 7585 len. 11]: If not yet dead , he is still to die .
Parsing [sent. 7586 len. 43]: I wish you had not told me so , '' continued she , bursting into tears ; `` what a state of agony and suspense must he have been in all this time , and I -- I have caused his sufferings !
Parsing [sent. 7587 len. 15]: I trusted he had long been released from this cruel , heartless world . ''
Parsing [sent. 7588 len. 17]: The flood of tears which followed assured me that I could safely impart the glad intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 7589 len. 10]: `` Mary , Mary , listen to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7590 len. 15]: `` Leave me , leave me , '' sobbed Mary , waving her hand .
Parsing [sent. 7591 len. 22]: `` No , Mary , not until I tell you that Tom is not only alive , but -- pardoned . ''
Parsing [sent. 7592 len. 4]: `` Pardoned ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7593 len. 3]: shrieked Mary .
Parsing [sent. 7594 len. 23]: `` Yes , pardoned , Mary -- free , Mary -- and in a few minutes will be in your arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 7595 len. 23]: Mary dropped on her knees , raised her hands and eyes to heaven , and then fell into a state of insensibility .
Parsing [sent. 7596 len. 42]: Tom , who had followed me , and remained near the house , had heard the shriek , and could no longer retain himself ; he flew into the room as Mary fell , and I put her into his arms .
Parsing [sent. 7597 len. 30]: At the first signs of returning sensibility , I left them together , and went to find old Stapleton , to whom I was more brief in my communication .
Parsing [sent. 7598 len. 10]: Stapleton continued to smoke his pipe during my narrative .
Parsing [sent. 7599 len. 17]: `` Glad of it , glad of it , '' said he , when I finished .
Parsing [sent. 7600 len. 56]: `` I were just thinking how all these senses brought us into trouble , more than all , that sense of love ; got me into trouble , and made me kill a man -- got my poor wife into trouble , and drowned her -- and now almost shot Tom , and killed Mary .
Parsing [sent. 7601 len. 17]: Had too much of HUMAN NATUR ' lately -- nothing but moist eyes and empty pipes .
Parsing [sent. 7602 len. 31]: Met that sergeant yesterday , had a turn up ; Tom settled one eye , and , old as I am , I 've settled the other for a time .
Parsing [sent. 7603 len. 18]: He 's in bed for a fortnight -- could n't help it -- human natur ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 7604 len. 62]: I took leave of Stapleton , and calling in upon Tom and Mary , shaking hands with the one , and kissing the other , I despatched a letter to the Dominie , acquainting him with what had passed , and then hastened to the Drummonds and imparted the happy results of my morning 's work to Sarah and her mother .
Parsing [sent. 7605 len. 26]: `` And now , Sarah , having so successfully arranged the affairs of other people , I should like to plead in my own behalf .
Parsing [sent. 7606 len. 24]: I think that after having been deprived almost wholly of your dear company for a month , I deserve to be rewarded . ''
Parsing [sent. 7607 len. 32]: `` You do , indeed , Jacob , '' said Mrs Drummond , `` and I am sure that Sarah thinks so too , if she will but acknowledge it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7608 len. 17]: `` I do acknowledge it , mamma ; but what is this reward to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7609 len. 33]: `` That you will allow your father and mother to arrange an early day for our nuptials , and also allow Tom and Mary to be united at the same altar . ''
Parsing [sent. 7610 len. 13]: `` Mamma , have I not always been a dutiful daughter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7611 len. 10]: `` Yes , my love , you have . ''
Parsing [sent. 7612 len. 42]: `` Then I shall do as I am bidden by my parents , Jacob ; it will be probably the last command I receive from them , and I shall obey it ; will that please you , dear Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7613 len. 33]: That evening the day was fixed , and now I must not weary the reader with a description of my feelings , or of my happiness in the preparations for the ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 7614 len. 24]: Sarah and I , Mary and Tom , were united on the same day , and there was nothing to cloud our happiness .
Parsing [sent. 7615 len. 34]: Tom took up his abode with his father and mother ; and Mary , radiant with happiness , even more beautiful than ever , has settled down into an excellent , doting wife .
Parsing [sent. 7616 len. 30]: For Sarah , I hardly need say the same ; she was my friend from childhood , she is now all that a man could hope and wish for .
Parsing [sent. 7617 len. 15]: We have been married several years , and are blessed with a numerous family .
Parsing [sent. 7618 len. 8]: I am now almost at a conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 7619 len. 17]: I have only to acquaint the reader with a few particulars relative to my early friends .
Parsing [sent. 7620 len. 39]: Stapleton is still alive , and is wedded to his pipe , which , with him , although the taste for tobacco has been considered as an acquired one , may truly be asserted to be human nature .
Parsing [sent. 7621 len. 19]: He has two wherries with apprentices , and from them gains a good livelihood , without working himself .
Parsing [sent. 7622 len. 35]: He says that the boys are not as honest as I was , and cheat him not a little ; but he consoles himself by asserting that it is nothing but human natur ' .
Parsing [sent. 7623 len. 24]: Old Tom is also strong and hearty , and says that he do n't intend to follow his legs for some time yet .
Parsing [sent. 7624 len. 15]: His dame , he says , is peaking , but Mary requires no assistance .
Parsing [sent. 7625 len. 20]: Old Tom has left off mending boats , his sign is taken down , for he is now comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 7626 len. 43]: When Tom married , I asked him what he wished to do ; he requested me to lend him money to purchase a lighter ; I made him a present of a new one , just launched by Mr Drummond 's firm .
Parsing [sent. 7627 len. 30]: But old Stapleton made over to him the 200 pounds , left to him by Mr Turnbull , and his mother brought out an equal sum from her hoards .
Parsing [sent. 7628 len. 36]: This enabled Tom to purchase another lighter , and now he has six or seven , I forget which ; at all events he is well off , and adding to his wealth every year .
Parsing [sent. 7629 len. 17]: They talk of removing to a better house , but the old couple wish to remain .
Parsing [sent. 7630 len. 35]: Old Tom , especially , has built an arbour where the old boat stood , and sits there carolling his songs , and watching the crafts as they go up and down the river .
Parsing [sent. 7631 len. 12]: Mr and Mrs Wharncliffe still continue my neighbours and dearest friends .
Parsing [sent. 7632 len. 19]: Mrs Turnbull died a few months back , and I am now in possession of the whole property .
Parsing [sent. 7633 len. 9]: My father and mother-in-law are well and happy .
Parsing [sent. 7634 len. 17]: Mr Drummond will retire from business as soon as he can wind up his multifarious concerns .
Parsing [sent. 7635 len. 13]: I have but one more to speak of -- the old Dominie .
Parsing [sent. 7636 len. 15]: It is now two years since I closed the eyes of this worthy man .
Parsing [sent. 7637 len. 30]: As he increased in years so did he in his abstractions of mind , and the governors of the charity thought it necessary to superannuate him with a pension .
Parsing [sent. 7638 len. 72]: It was a heavy blow to the old man , who asserted his capabilities to continue to instruct ; but people thought otherwise , and he accepted my offer to take up his future residence with us , upon the understanding that it was necessary that our children , the eldest of whom , at that time , was but four years old , should be instructed in Latin and Greek .
Parsing [sent. 7639 len. 53]: He removed to us with all his books , etcetera , not forgetting the formidable birch ; but as the children would not take to the Latin of their own accord , and Mrs Faithful would not allow the rod to be made use of , the Dominie 's occupation was gone .
Parsing [sent. 7640 len. 45]: Still , such was the force of habit , that he never went without the Latin grammar in his pocket , and I have often watched him sitting down in the poultry-yard , fancying , I presume , that he was in his school .
Parsing [sent. 7641 len. 52]: There would he decline , construe , and conjugate aloud , his only witnesses being the poultry , who would now and then raise a gobble , gobble , gobble , while the ducks with their _ quack , quack , quack _ , were still more impertinent in their replies .
Parsing [sent. 7642 len. 75]: A sketch of him , in this position , has been taken by Sarah , and now hangs over the mantel-piece of my study , between two of Mr Turnbull 's drawings , one of an iceberg , on the 17th of August ' 78 , and the other showing the dangerous position of the _ Camel _ whaler , jammed between the floe of ice , in latitude -- , and longitude -- .
Parsing [sent. 7643 len. 9]: Reader , I have now finished my narrative .
Parsing [sent. 7644 len. 109]: There are two morals , I trust , to be drawn from the events of my life , one of which is , that in society we naturally depend upon each other for support , and that he who would assert his independence throws himself out of the current which bears to advancement ; the other is , that with the advantages of good education , and good principle , although it can not be expected that everyone will be so fortunate as I have been , still there is every reasonable hope , and every right to expect , that we shall do well in this world .
Parsing [sent. 7645 len. 114]: Thrown up , as the Dominie expressed himself , as a tangled weed from the river , you have seen the orphan and charity-boy rise to wealth and consideration ; you have seen how he who was friendless secured to himself the warmest friends ; he who required everything from others became in a situation to protect and assist in return ; he who could not call one individual his relation , united to the object of his attachment , and blessed with a numerous family ; and to amass all these advantages and this sum of happiness , the only capital with which he embarked was a good education and good principles .
Parsing [sent. 7646 len. 4]: Reader , farewell !
