Parsing [sent. 1 len. 139]: Oliver Twist or The Parish Boy 's Progress by Charles Dickens CHAPTER I TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIRTH Among other public buildings in a certain town , which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning , and to which I will assign no fictitious name , there is one anciently common to most towns , great or small : to wit , a workhouse ; and in this workhouse was born ; on a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat , inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader , in this stage of the business at all events ; the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 100]: For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble , by the parish surgeon , it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all ; in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared ; or , if they had , that being comprised within a couple of pages , they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography , extant in the literature of any age or country .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 58]: Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse , is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being , I do mean to say that in this particular instance , it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 71]: The fact is , that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration , -- a troublesome practice , but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence ; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress , rather unequally poised between this world and the next : the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 42]: Now , if , during this brief period , Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers , anxious aunts , experienced nurses , and doctors of profound wisdom , he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 46]: There being nobody by , however , but a pauper old woman , who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer ; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract ; Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 84]: The result was , that , after a few struggles , Oliver breathed , sneezed , and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish , by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage , a voice , for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 64]: As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs , the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead , rustled ; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow ; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words , ` Let me see the child , and die . '
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 26]: The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire : giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 42]: As the young woman spoke , he rose , and advancing to the bed 's head , said , with more kindness than might have been expected of him : ` Oh , you must not talk about dying yet . '
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 10]: ` Lor bless her dear heart , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 29]: interposed the nurse , hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle , the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 60]: ` Lor bless her dear heart , when she has lived as long as I have , sir , and had thirteen children of her own , and all on 'em dead except two , and them in the wurkus with me , she 'll know better than to take on in that way , bless her dear heart !
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 18]: Think what it is to be a mother , there 's a dear young lamb do . '
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 16]: Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother 's prospects failed in producing its due effect .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 15]: The patient shook her head , and stretched out her hand towards the child .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 8]: The surgeon deposited it in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 30]: She imprinted her cold white lips passionately on its forehead ; passed her hands over her face ; gazed wildly round ; shuddered ; fell back -- and died .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 17]: They chafed her breast , hands , and temples ; but the blood had stopped forever .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 7]: They talked of hope and comfort .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 7]: They had been strangers too long .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 10]: ` It 's all over , Mrs. Thingummy ! '
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 6]: said the surgeon at last .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 11]: ` Ah , poor dear , so it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 30]: said the nurse , picking up the cork of the green bottle , which had fallen out on the pillow , as she stooped to take up the child .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 5]: ` Poor dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 30]: ` You need n't mind sending up to me , if the child cries , nurse , ' said the surgeon , putting on his gloves with great deliberation .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 10]: ` It 's very likely it WILL be troublesome .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 10]: Give it a little gruel if it is . '
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 37]: He put on his hat , and , pausing by the bed-side on his way to the door , added , ` She was a good-looking girl , too ; where did she come from ? '
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 21]: ` She was brought here last night , ' replied the old woman , ` by the overseer 's order .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 8]: She was found lying in the street .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 31]: She had walked some distance , for her shoes were worn to pieces ; but where she came from , or where she was going to , nobody knows . '
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 13]: The surgeon leaned over the body , and raised the left hand .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 20]: ` The old story , ' he said , shaking his head : ` no wedding-ring , I see .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 3]: Good-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 39]: The medical gentleman walked away to dinner ; and the nurse , having once more applied herself to the green bottle , sat down on a low chair before the fire , and proceeded to dress the infant .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 15]: What an excellent example of the power of dress , young Oliver Twist was !
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 44]: Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering , he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar ; it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in society .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 68]: But now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service , he was badged and ticketed , and fell into his place at once -- a parish child -- the orphan of a workhouse -- the humble , half-starved drudge -- to be cuffed and buffeted through the world -- despised by all , and pitied by none .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 4]: Oliver cried lustily .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 29]: If he could have known that he was an orphan , left to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers , perhaps he would have cried the louder .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 34]: CHAPTER II TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST 'S GROWTH , EDUCATION , AND BOARD For the next eight or ten months , Oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 7]: He was brought up by hand .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 21]: The hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 45]: The parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities , whether there was no female then domiciled in ` the house ' who was in a situation to impart to Oliver Twist , the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 12]: The workhouse authorities replied with humility , that there was not .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 94]: Upon this , the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved , that Oliver should be ` farmed , ' or , in other words , that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse some three miles off , where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws , rolled about the floor all day , without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing , under the parental superintendence of an elderly female , who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 35]: Sevenpence-halfpenny 's worth per week is a good round diet for a child ; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny , quite enough to overload its stomach , and make it uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 33]: The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience ; she knew what was good for children ; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 34]: So , she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use , and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 19]: Thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still ; and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 82]: Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating , and who demonstrated it so well , that he had got his own horse down to a straw a day , and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal on nothing at all , if he had not died , four-and-twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 121]: Unfortunately for , the experimenal philosophy of the female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over , a similar result usually attended the operation of HER system ; for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food , it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten , either that it sickened from want and cold , or fell into the fire from neglect , or got half-smothered by accident ; in any one of which cases , the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world , and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 84]: Occasionally , when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead , or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing -- though the latter accident was very scarce , anything approaching to a washing being of rare occurance in the farm -- the jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions , or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 58]: But these impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon , and the testimony of the beadle ; the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside -LRB- which was very probable indeed -RRB- , and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted ; which was very self-devotional .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 26]: Besides , the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm , and always sent the beadle the day before , to say they were going .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 21]: The children were neat and clean to behold , when THEY went ; and what more would the people have !
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 19]: It can not be expected that this system of farming would produce any very extraordinary or luxuriant crop .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 23]: Oliver Twist 's ninth birthday found him a pale thin child , somewhat diminutive in stature , and decidely small in circumference .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 15]: But nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver 's breast .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 34]: It had had plenty of room to expand , thanks to the spare diet of the establishment ; and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth birth-day at all .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 87]: Be this as it may , however , it was his ninth birthday ; and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party of two other young gentleman , who , after participating with him in a sound thrashing , had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry , when Mrs. Mann , the good lady of the house , was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble , the beadle , striving to undo the wicket of the garden-gate .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 4]: ` Goodness gracious !
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 10]: Is that you , Mr. Bumble , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 18]: said Mrs. Mann , thrusting her head out of the window in well-affected ecstasies of joy . '
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 17]: -LRB- Susan , take Oliver and them two brats upstairs , and wash 'em directly . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 5]: -- My heart alive !
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 14]: Mr. Bumble , how glad I am to see you , sure-ly ! '
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 55]: Now , Mr. Bumble was a fat man , and a choleric ; so , instead of responding to this open-hearted salutation in a kindred spirit , he gave the little wicket a tremendous shake , and then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle 's .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 33]: ` Lor , only think , ' said Mrs. Mann , running out , -- for the three boys had been removed by this time , -- ` only think of that !
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 21]: That I should have forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside , on account of them dear children !
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 17]: Walk in sir ; walk in , pray , Mr. Bumble , do , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 26]: Although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have softened the heart of a church-warden , it by no means mollified the beadle .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 46]: ` Do you think this respectful or proper conduct , Mrs. Mann , ' inquired Mr. Bumble , grasping his cane , ` to keep the parish officers a waiting at your garden-gate , when they come here upon porochial business with the porochial orphans ?
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 25]: Are you aweer , Mrs. Mann , that you are , as I may say , a porochial delegate , and a stipendiary ? '
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 42]: ` I 'm sure Mr. Bumble , that I was only a telling one or two of the dear children as is so fond of you , that it was you a coming , ' replied Mrs. Mann with great humility .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 14]: Mr. Bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his importance .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 11]: He had displayed the one , and vindicated the other .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 3]: He relaxed .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 28]: ` Well , well , Mrs. Mann , ' he replied in a calmer tone ; ` it may be as you say ; it may be .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 21]: Lead the way in , Mrs. Mann , for I come on business , and have something to say . '
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 34]: Mrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor ; placed a seat for him ; and officiously deposited his cocked hat and can on the table before him .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 24]: Mr. Bumble wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his walk had engendered , glanced complacently at the cocked hat , and smiled .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 5]: Yes , he smiled .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 10]: Beadles are but men : and Mr. Bumble smiled .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 25]: ` Now do n't you be offended at what I 'm a going to say , ' observed Mrs. Mann , with captivating sweetness .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 18]: ` You 've had a long walk , you know , or I would n't mention it .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 15]: Now , will you take a little drop of somethink , Mr. Bumble ? '
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 5]: ` Not a drop .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 22]: Nor a drop , ' said Mr. Bumble , waving his right hand in a dignified , but placid manner . '
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 27]: I think you will , ' said Mrs. Mann , who had noticed the tone of the refusal , and the gesture that had accompanied it .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 19]: ` Just a leetle drop , with a little cold water , and a lump of sugar . '
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 4]: Mr. Bumble coughed .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 14]: ` Now , just a leetle drop , ' said Mrs. Mann persuasively .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 6]: ` What is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 4]: inquired the beadle .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 55]: ` Why , it 's what I 'm obliged to keep a little of in the house , to put into the blessed infants ' Daffy , when they ai n't well , Mr. Bumble , ' replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard , and took down a bottle and glass .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 5]: ` It 's gin .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 13]: I 'll not deceive you , Mr. B. It 's gin . '
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 12]: ` Do you give the children Daffy , Mrs. Mann ? '
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 13]: inquired Bumble , following with this eyes the interesting process of mixing .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 21]: ` Ah , bless 'em , that I do , dear as it is , ' replied the nurse . '
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 16]: I could n't see 'em suffer before my very eyes , you know sir . '
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 16]: ` No ' ; said Mr. Bumble approvingly ; ` no , you could not .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 10]: You are a humane woman , Mrs. Mann . '
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 10]: -LRB- Here she set down the glass . -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 17]: I shall take a early opportunity of mentioning it to the board , Mrs. Mann . '
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 8]: -LRB- He drew it towards him . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 11]: ` You feel as a mother , Mrs. Mann . '
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 7]: -LRB- He stirred the gin-and-water . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 21]: ` I -- I drink your health with cheerfulness , Mrs. Mann ' ; and he swallowed half of it .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 17]: ` And now about business , ' said the beadle , taking out a leathern pocket-book .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 20]: ` The child that was half-baptized Oliver Twist , is nine year old to-day. ; ` Bless him ! '
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 15]: interposed Mrs. Mann , inflaming her left eye with the corner of her apron .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 18]: ` And notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound , which was afterwards increased to twenty pound .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 55]: Notwithstanding the most superlative , and , I may say , supernat ` ral exertions on the part of this parish , ' said Bumble , ` we have never been able to discover who is his father , or what was his mother 's settlement , name , or con -- dition . '
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 31]: Mrs Mann raised her hands in astonishment ; but added , after a moment 's reflection , ` How comes he to have any name at all , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 18]: The beadle drew himself up with great pride , and said , ' I inwented it . '
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 7]: ` You , Mr. Bumble ! '
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 6]: ` I , Mrs. Mann .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 8]: We name our fondlings in alphabetical order .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 13]: The last was a S , -- Swubble , I named him .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 12]: This was a T , -- Twist , I named HIM .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 13]: The next one comes will be Unwin , and the next Vilkins .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 40]: I have got names ready made to the end of the alphabet , and all the way through it again , when we come to Z. ' ` Why , you 're quite a literary character , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 4]: said Mrs. Mann .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 22]: ` Well , well , ' said the beadle , evidently gratified with the compliment ; ` perhaps I may be .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 9]: Perhaps I may be , Mrs. Mann . '
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 30]: He finished the gin-and-water , and added , ` Oliver being now too old to remain here , the board have determined to have him back into the house .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 10]: I have come out myself to take him there .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 9]: So let me see him at once . '
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 19]: ` I 'll fetch him directly , ' said Mrs. Mann , leaving the room for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 43]: Oliver , having had by this time as much of the outer coat of dirt which encrusted his face and hands , removed , as could be scrubbed off in one washing , was led into the room by his benevolent protectress .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 15]: ` Make a bow to the gentleman , Oliver , ' said Mrs. Mann .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 23]: Oliver made a bow , which was divided between the beadle on the chair , and the cocked hat on the table .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 11]: ` Will you go along with me , Oliver ? '
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 9]: said Mr. Bumble , in a majestic voice .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 49]: Oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great readiness , when , glancing upward , he caught sight of Mrs. Mann , who had got behind the beadle 's chair , and was shaking her fist at him with a furious countenance .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 27]: He took the hint at once , for the fist had been too often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his recollection .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 8]: ` Will she go with me ? '
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 4]: inquired poor Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 12]: ` No , she ca n't , ' replied Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 11]: ` But she 'll come and see you sometimes . '
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 10]: This was no very great consolation to the child .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 23]: Young as he was , however , he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at going away .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 16]: It was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears into his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 20]: Hunger and recent ill-usage are great assistants if you want to cry ; and Oliver cried very naturally indeed .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 37]: Mrs. Mann gave him a thousand embraces , and what Oliver wanted a great deal more , a piece of bread and butter , less he should seem too hungry when he got to the workhouse .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 47]: With the slice of bread in his hand , and the little brown-cloth parish cap on his head , Oliver was then led away by Mr. Bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never lighted the gloom of his infant years .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 18]: And yet he burst into an agony of childish grief , as the cottage-gate closed after him .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 46]: Wretched as were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind , they were the only friends he had ever known ; and a sense of his loneliness in the great wide world , sank into the child 's heart for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 39]: Mr. Bumble walked on with long strides ; little Oliver , firmly grasping his gold-laced cuff , trotted beside him , inquiring at the end of every quarter of a mile whether they were ` nearly there . '
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 36]: To these interrogations Mr. Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies ; for the temporary blandness which gin-and-water awakens in some bosoms had by this time evaporated ; and he was once again a beadle .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 73]: Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an hour , and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of bread , when Mr. Bumble , who had handed him over to the care of an old woman , returned ; and , telling him it was a board night , informed him that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 35]: Not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was , Oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence , and was not quite certain whether he ought to laugh or cry .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 68]: He had no time to think about the matter , however ; for Mr. Bumble gave him a tap on the head , with his cane , to wake him up : and another on the back to make him lively : and bidding him to follow , conducted him into a large white-washed room , where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 30]: At the top of the table , seated in an arm-chair rather higher than the rest , was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round , red face .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 10]: ` Bow to the board , ' said Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 27]: Oliver brushed away two or three tears that were lingering in his eyes ; and seeing no board but the table , fortunately bowed to that .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 9]: ` What 's your name , boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 8]: said the gentleman in the high chair .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 30]: Oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen , which made him tremble : and the beadle gave him another tap behind , which made him cry .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 27]: These two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating voice ; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 18]: Which was a capital way of raising his spirits , and putting him quite at his ease .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 17]: ` Boy , ' said the gentleman in the high chair , ` listen to me .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 11]: You know you 're an orphan , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 8]: ` What 's that , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 4]: inquired poor Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 21]: ` The boy IS a fool -- I thought he was , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 8]: said the gentleman who had spoken first .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 26]: ` You know you 've got no father or mother , and that you were brought up by the parish , do n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 12]: ` Yes , sir , ' replied Oliver , weeping bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 8]: ` What are you crying for ? '
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 8]: inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 9]: And to be sure it was very extraordinary .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 9]: What COULD the boy be crying for ? '
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 39]: I hope you say your prayers every night , ' said another gentleman in a gruff voice ; ` and pray for the people who feed you , and take care of you -- like a Christian . '
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 10]: ` Yes , sir , ' stammered the boy .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 9]: The gentleman who spoke last was unconsciously right .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 31]: It would have been very like a Christian , and a marvellously good Christian too , if Oliver had prayed for the people who fed and took care of HIM .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 11]: But he had n't , because nobody had taught him .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 24]: You have come here to be educated , and taught a useful trade , ' said the red-faced gentleman in the high chair .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 24]: ` So you 'll begin to pick oakum to-morrow morning at six o'clock , ' added the surly one in the white waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 51]: For the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process of picking oakum , Oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle , and was then hurried away to a large ward ; where , on a rough , hard bed , he sobbed himself to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 11]: What a novel illustration of the tender laws of England !
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 8]: They let the paupers go to sleep !
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 3]: Poor Oliver !
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 40]: He little thought , as he lay sleeping in happy unconsciousness of all around him , that the board had that very day arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence over all his future fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 4]: But they had .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 51]: And this was it : The members of this board were very sage , deep , philosophical men ; and when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse , they found out at once , what ordinary folks would nver have discovered -- the poor people liked it !
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 52]: It was a regular place of public entertainment for the poorer classes ; a tavern where there was nothing to pay ; a public breakfast , dinner , tea , and supper all the year round ; a brick and mortar elysium , where it was all play and no work .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 4]: ` Oho ! '
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 30]: said the board , looking very knowing ; ` we are the fellows to set this to rights ; we 'll stop it all , in no time . '
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 46]: So , they established the rule , that all poor people should have the alternative -LRB- for they would compel nobody , not they -RRB- , of being starved by a gradual process in the house , or by a quick one out of it .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 54]: With this view , they contracted with the water-works to lay on an unlimited supply of water ; and with a corn-factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal ; and issued three meals of thin gruel a day , with an onion twice a week , and half a roll of Sundays .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 78]: They made a great many other wise and humane regulations , having reference to the ladies , which it is not necessary to repeat ; kindly undertook to divorce poor married people , in consequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors ' Commons ; and , instead of compelling a man to support his family , as they had theretofore done , took his family away from him , and made him a bachelor !
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 50]: There is no saying how many applicants for relief , under these last two heads , might have started up in all classes of society , if it had not been coupled with the workhouse ; but the board were long-headed men , and had provided for this difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 16]: The relief was inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel ; and that frightened people .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 18]: For the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed , the system was in full operation .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 49]: It was rather expensive at first , in consequence of the increase in the undertaker 's bill , and the necessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers , which fluttered loosely on their wasted , shrunken forms , after a week or two 's gruel .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 21]: But the number of workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers ; and the board were in ecstasies .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 50]: The room in which the boys were fed , was a large stone hall , with a copper at one end : out of which the master , dressed in an apron for the purpose , and assisted by one or two women , ladled the gruel at mealtimes .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 34]: Of this festive composition each boy had one porringer , and no more -- except on occasions of great public rejoicing , when he had two ounces and a quarter of bread besides .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 6]: The bowls never wanted washing .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 95]: The boys polished them with their spoons till they shone again ; and when they had performed this operation -LRB- which never took very long , the spoons being nearly as large as the bowls -RRB- , they would sit staring at the copper , with such eager eyes , as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was composed ; employing themselves , meanwhile , in sucking their fingers most assiduously , with the view of catching up any stray splashes of gruel that might have been cast thereon .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 6]: Boys have generally excellent appetites .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 103]: Oliver Twist and his companions suffered the tortures of slow starvation for three months : at last they got so voracious and wild with hunger , that one boy , who was tall for his age , and had n't been used to that sort of thing -LRB- for his father had kept a small cook-shop -RRB- , hinted darkly to his companions , that unless he had another basin of gruel per diem , he was afraid he might some night happen to eat the boy who slept next him , who happened to be a weakly youth of tender age .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 14]: He had a wild , hungry eye ; and they implicitly believed him .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 32]: A council was held ; lots were cast who should walk up to the master after supper that evening , and ask for more ; and it fell to Oliver Twist .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 10]: The evening arrived ; the boys took their places .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 40]: The master , in his cook 's uniform , stationed himself at the copper ; his pauper assistants ranged themselves behind him ; the gruel was served out ; and a long grace was said over the short commons .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 22]: The gruel disappeared ; the boys whispered each other , and winked at Oliver ; while his next neighbours nudged him .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 16]: Child as he was , he was desperate with hunger , and reckless with misery .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 38]: He rose from the table ; and advancing to the master , basin and spoon in hand , said : somewhat alarmed at his own temerity : ` Please , sir , I want some more . '
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 15]: The master was a fat , healthy man ; but he turned very pale .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 22]: He gazed in stupified astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds , and then clung for support to the copper .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 12]: The assistants were paralysed with wonder ; the boys with fear .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 4]: ` What ! '
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 11]: said the master at length , in a faint voice .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 16]: ` Please , sir , ' replied Oliver , ' I want some more . '
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 26]: The master aimed a blow at Oliver 's head with the ladle ; pinioned him in his arm ; and shrieked aloud for the beadle .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 41]: The board were sitting in solemn conclave , when Mr. Bumble rushed into the room in great excitement , and addressing the gentleman in the high chair , said , ` Mr. Limbkins , I beg your pardon , sir !
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 8]: Oliver Twist has asked for more ! '
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 6]: There was a general start .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 7]: Horror was depicted on every countenance .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 5]: ` For MORE ! '
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 4]: said Mr. Limbkins .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 11]: ` Compose yourself , Bumble , and answer me distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 21]: Do I understand that he asked for more , after he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary ? '
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 10]: ` He did , sir , ' replied Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 17]: ` That boy will be hung , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat . '
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 9]: I know that boy will be hung . '
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 8]: Nobody controverted the prophetic gentleman 's opinion .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 6]: An animated discussion took place .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 41]: Oliver was ordered into instant confinement ; and a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate , offering a reward of five pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the hands of the parish .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 30]: In other words , five pounds and Oliver Twist were offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade , business , or calling . '
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 58]: I never was more convinced of anything in my life , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat , as he knocked at the gate and read the bill next morning : ' I never was more convinced of anything in my life , than I am that that boy will come to be hung . '
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 58]: As I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated gentleman was right or not , I should perhaps mar the interest of this narrative -LRB- supposing it to possess any at all -RRB- , if I ventured to hint just yet , whether the life of Oliver Twist had this violent termination or no .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 62]: CHAPTER III RELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SINECURE For a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of asking for more , Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of the board .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 70]: It appears , at first sight not unreasonable to suppose , that , if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat , he would have established that sage individual 's prophetic character , once and for ever , by tying one end of his pocket-handkerchief to a hook in the wall , and attaching himself to the other .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 62]: To the performance of this feat , however , there was one obstacle : namely , that pocket-handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury , had been , for all future times and ages , removed from the noses of paupers by the express order of the board , in council assembled : solemnly given and pronounced under their hands and seals .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 13]: There was a still greater obstacle in Oliver 's youth and childishness .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 82]: He only cried bitterly all day ; and , when the long , dismal night came on , spread his little hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness , and crouching in the corner , tried to sleep : ever and anon waking with a start and tremble , and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall , as if to feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which surrounded him .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 44]: Let it not be supposed by the enemies of ` the system , ' that , during the period of his solitary incarceration , Oliver was denied the benefit of exercise , the pleasure of society , or the advantages of religious consolation .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 59]: As for exercise , it was nice cold weather , and he was allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump , in a stone yard , in the presence of Mr. Bumble , who prevented his catching cold , and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame , by repeated applications of the cane .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 29]: As for society , he was carried every other day into the hall where the boys dined , and there sociably flogged as a public warning and example .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 119]: And so for from being denied the advantages of religious consolation , he was kicked into the same apartment every evening at prayer-time , and there permitted to listen to , and console his mind with , a general supplication of the boys , containing a special clause , therein inserted by authority of the board , in which they entreated to be made good , virtuous , contented , and obedient , and to be guarded from the sins and vices of Oliver Twist : whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness , and an article direct from the manufactory of the very Devil himself .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 56]: It chanced one morning , while Oliver 's affairs were in this auspicious and confortable state , that Mr. Gamfield , chimney-sweep , went his way down the High Street , deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means of paying certain arrears of rent , for which his landlord had become rather pressing .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 55]: Mr. Gamfield 's most sanguine estimate of his finances could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount ; and , in a species of arthimetical desperation , he was alternately cudgelling his brains and his donkey , when passing the workhouse , his eyes encountered the bill on the gate .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 6]: ` Wo -- o ! '
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 7]: said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 57]: The donkey was in a state of profound abstraction : wondering , probably , whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage-stalk or two when he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was laden ; so , without noticing the word of command , he jogged onward .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 44]: Mr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally , but more particularly on his eyes ; and , running after him , bestowed a blow on his head , which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a donkey 's .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 37]: Then , catching hold of the bridle , he gave his jaw a sharp wrench , by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master ; and by these means turned him round .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 20]: He then gave him another blow on the head , just to stun him till he came back again .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 17]: Having completed these arrangements , he walked up to the gate , to read the bill .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 29]: The gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his hands behind him , after having delivered himself of some profound sentiments in the board-room .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 43]: Having witnessed the little dispute between Mr. Gamfield and the donkey , he smiled joyously when that person came up to read the bill , for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield was exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 67]: Mr. Gamfield smiled , too , as he perused the document ; for five pounds was just the sum he had been wishing for ; and , as to the boy with which it was encumbered , Mr. Gamfield , knowing what the dietary of the workhouse was , well knew he would be a nice small pattern , just the very thing for register stoves .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 34]: So , he spelt the bill through again , from beginning to end ; and then , touching his fur cap in token of humility , accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 20]: ` This here boy , sir , wot the parish wants to ` prentis , ' said Mr. Gamfield .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 20]: ` Ay , my man , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat , with a condescending smile .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 6]: ` What of him ? '
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 44]: ` If the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade , in a good ` spectable chimbley-sweepin ' bisness , ' said Mr. Gamfield , ' I wants a ` prentis , and I am ready to take him . '
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 13]: ` Walk in , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 51]: Mr. Gamfield having lingered behind , to give the donkey another blow on the head , and another wrench of the jaw , as a caution not to run away in his absence , followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room where Oliver had first seen him .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 20]: ` It 's a nasty trade , ' said Mr. Limbkins , when Gamfield had again stated his wish .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 16]: ` Young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now , ' said another gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 68]: ` That 's acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley to make 'em come down again , ' said Gamfield ; ` that 's all smoke , and no blaze ; vereas smoke ai n't o ' no use at all in making a boy come down , for it only sinds him to sleep , and that 's wot he likes .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 31]: Boys is wery obstinit , and wery lazy , Gen ` l'men , and there 's nothink like a good hot blaze to make 'em come down vith a run .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 31]: It 's humane too , gen ` l'men , acause , even if they 've stuck in the chimbley , roasting their feet makes 'em struggle to hextricate theirselves . '
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 27]: The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation ; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr. Limbkins .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 49]: The board then procedded to converse among themselves for a few minutes , but in so low a tone , that the words ` saving of expenditure , ' ` looked well in the accounts , ' ` have a printed report published , ' were alone audible .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 21]: These only chanced to be heard , indeed , or account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 41]: At length the whispering ceased ; and the members of the board , having resumed their seats and their solemnity , Mr. Limbkins said : ` We have considered your proposition , and we do n't approve of it . '
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 14]: ` Not at all , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 10]: ` Decidedly not , ' added the other members .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 53]: As Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having bruised three or four boys to death already , it occurred to him that the board had , perhaps , in some unaccountable freak , taken it into their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 44]: It was very unlike their general mode of doing business , if they had ; but still , as he had no particular wish to revive the rumour , he twisted his cap in his hands , and walked slowly from the table .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 15]: ` So you wo n't let me have him , gen ` l'men ? '
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 9]: said Mr. Gamfield , pausing near the door .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 34]: ` No , ' replied Mr. Limbkins ; ` at least , as it 's a nasty business , we think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered . '
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 32]: Mr. Gamfield 's countenance brightened , as , with a quick step , he returned to the table , and said , ` What 'll you give , gen ` l'men ?
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 10]: Do n't be too hard on a poor man .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 7]: What 'll you give ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 15]: I should say , three pound ten was plenty , ' said Mr. Limbkins .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 15]: ` Ten shillings too much , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 4]: ` Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 12]: said Gamfield ; ` say four pound , gen ` l'men .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 16]: Say four pound , and you 've got rid of him for good and all .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 3]: There ! '
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 12]: ` Three pound ten , ' repeated Mr. Limbkins , firmly .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 3]: ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 15]: I 'll split the diff ` erence , gen ` l'men , urged Gamfield .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 6]: ` Three pound fifteen . '
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 15]: ` Not a farthing more , ' was the firm reply of Mr. Limbkins .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 17]: ` You 're desperate hard upon me , gen ` l'men , said Gamfield , wavering .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 3]: ` Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 2]: pooh !
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 3]: nonsense ! '
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 8]: said the gentleman in the white waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 14]: ` He 'd be cheap with nothing at all , as a premium .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 7]: Take him , you silly fellow !
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 8]: He 's just the boy for you .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 35]: He wants the stick , now and then : it 'll do him good ; and his board need n't come very expensive , for he has n't been overfed since he was born .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 3]: ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 30]: Mr. Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table , and , observing a smile on all of them , gradually broke into a smile himself .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 5]: The bargain was made .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 30]: Mr. Bumble , was at once instructed that Oliver Twist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate , for signature and approval , that very afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 29]: In pursuance of this determination , little Oliver , to his excessive astonishment , was released from bondage , and ordered to put himself into a clean shirt .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 39]: He had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic performance , when Mr. Bumble brought him , with his own hands , a basin of gruel , and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of bread .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 45]: At this tremendous sight , Oliver began to cry very piteously : thinking , not unaturally , that the board must have determined to kill him for some useful purpose , or they never would have begun to fatten him up in that way .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 30]: ` Do n't make your eyes red , Oliver , but eat your food and be thankful , ' said Mr. Bumble , in a tone of impressive pomposity .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 17]: ` You 're a going to be made a ` prentice of , Oliver . ' '
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 6]: A prentice , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 6]: said the child , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 10]: ` Yes , Oliver , ' said Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 58]: ` The kind and blessed gentleman which is so amny parents to you , Oliver , when you have none of your own : are a going to ` prentice you : and to set you up in life , and make a man of you : although the expense to the parish is three pound ten !
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 7]: -- three pound ten , Oliver !
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 10]: -- seventy shillins -- one hundred and forty sixpences !
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 14]: -- and all for a naughty orphan which noboday ca n't love . '
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 32]: As Mr. Bumble paused to take breath , after delivering this address in an awful voice , the tears rolled down the poor child 's face , and he sobbed bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 33]: ` Come , ' said Mr. Bumble , somewhat less pompously , for it was gratifying to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced ; ` Come , Oliver !
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 28]: Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket , and do n't cry into your gruel ; that 's a very foolish action , Oliver . '
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 14]: It certainly was , for there was quite enough water in it already .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 89]: On their way to the magistrate , Mr. Bumble instructed Oliver that all he would have to do , would be to look very happy , and say , when the gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed , that he should like it very much indeed ; both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey : the rather as Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle hint , that if he failed in either particular , there was no telling what would be done to him .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 35]: When they arrived at the office , he was shut up in a little room by himself , and admonished by Mr. Bumble to stay there , until he came back to fetch him .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 15]: There the boy remained , with a palpitating heart , for half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 37]: At the expiration of which time Mr. Bumble thrust in his head , unadorned with the cocked hat , and said aloud : ` Now , Oliver , my dear , come to the gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 35]: As Mr. Bumble said this , he put on a grim and threatening look , and added , in a low voice , ` Mind what I told you , you young rascal ! '
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 43]: Oliver stared innocently in Mr. Bumble 's face at this somewhat contradictory style of address ; but that gentleman prevented his offering any remark thereupon , by leading him at once into an adjoining room : the door of which was open .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 11]: It was a large room , with a great window .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 46]: Behind a desk , sat two old gentleman with powdered heads : one of whom was reading the newspaper ; while the other was perusing , with the aid of a pair of tortoise-shell spectacles , a small piece of parchment which lay before him .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 41]: Mr. Limbkins was standing in front of the desk on one side ; and Mr. Gamfield , with a partially washed face , on the other ; while two or three bluff-looking men , in top-boots , were lounging about .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 38]: The old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off , over the little bit of parchment ; and there was a short pause , after Oliver had been stationed by Mr. Bumble in front of the desk .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 14]: ` This is the boy , your worship , ' said Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 34]: The old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a moment , and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve ; whereupon , the last-mentioned old gentleman woke up .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 9]: ` Oh , is this the boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 5]: said the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 12]: ` This is him , sir , ' replied Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 10]: ` Bow to the magistrate , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 10]: Oliver roused himself , and made his best obeisance .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 37]: He had been wondering , with his eyes fixed on the magistrates ' powder , whether all boards were born with that white stuff on their heads , and were boards from thenceforth on that account .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 19]: ` Well , ' said the old gentleman , ' I suppose he 's fond of chimney-sweeping ? '
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 31]: ` He doats on it , your worship , ' replied Bumble ; giving Oliver a sly pinch , to intimate that he had better not say he did n't .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 12]: ` And he WILL be a sweep , will he ? '
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 5]: inquired the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 26]: ` If we was to bind him to any other trade to-morrow , he 'd run away simultaneous , your worship , ' replied Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 37]: ` And this man that 's to be his master -- you , sir -- you 'll treat him well , and feed him , and do all that sort of thing , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 5]: said the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 18]: ` When I says I will , I means I will , ' replied Mr. Gamfield doggedly .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 50]: ` You 're a rough speaker , my friend , but you look an honest , open-hearted man , ' said the old gentleman : turning his spectacles in the direction of the candidate for Oliver 's premium , whose villainous countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 25]: But the magistrate was half blind and half childish , so he could n't reasonably be expected to discern what other people did . '
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 18]: I hope I am , sir , ' said Mr. Gamfield , with an ugly leer . '
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 33]: I have no doubt you are , my friend , ' replied the old gentleman : fixing his spectacles more firmly on his nose , and looking about him for the inkstand .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 10]: It was the critical moment of Oliver 's fate .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 36]: If the inkstand had been where the old gentleman though it was , he would have dipped his pen into it , and signed the indentures , and Oliver would have been straightway hurried off .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 104]: But , as it chanced to be immediately under his nose , it followed , as a matter of course , that he looked all over his desk for it , without finding it ; and happening in the course of his search to look straight before him , his gaze encountered the pale and terrified face of Oliver Twist : who , despite all the admonitory looks and pinches of Bumble , was regarding the repulsive countenance of his future master , with a mingled expression of horror and fear , too palpable to be mistaken , even by a half-blind magistrate .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 30]: The old gentleman stopped , laid down his pen , and looked from Oliver to Mr. Limbkins ; who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and unconcerned aspect .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 5]: ` My boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 12]: said the old gentleman , ` you look pale and alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 6]: What is the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 30]: ` Stand a little away from him , Beadle , ' said the other magistrate : laying aside the paper , and leaning forward with an expression of interest .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 18]: ` Now , boy , tell us what 's the matter : do n't be afraid . '
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 49]: Oliver fell on his knees , and clasping his hands together , prayed that they would order him back to the dark room -- that they would starve him -- beat him -- kill him if they pleased -- rather than send him away with that dreadful man .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 14]: said Mr. Bumble , raising his hands and eyes with most impressive solemnite .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 23]: of all the artful and designing orphans that ever I see , Oliver , you are one of the most bare-facedest . '
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 26]: ` Hold your tongue , Beadle , ' said the second old gentleman , when Mr. Bumble had given vent to this compound adjective . '
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 18]: I beg your worship 's pardon , ' said Mr. Bumble , incredulous of having heard aright .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 9]: ` Did your worship speak to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 5]: Hold your tongue . '
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 7]: Mr. Bumble was stupefied with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 8]: A beadle ordered to hold his tongue !
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 4]: A moral revolution !
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 16]: The old gentleman in the tortoise-shell spectacles looked at his companion , he nodded significantly .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 25]: ` We refuse to sanction these indentures , ' said the old gentleman : tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke . '
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 38]: I hope , ' stammered Mr. Limbkins : ' I hope the magistrates will not form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper conduct , on the unsupported testimony of a child . '
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 23]: ` The magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the matter , ' said the second old gentleman sharply .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 14]: ` Take the boy back to the workhouse , and treat him kindly .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 7]: He seems to want it . '
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 36]: That same evening , the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively and decidedly affirmed , not only that Oliver would be hung , but that he would be drawn and quartered into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 57]: Mr. Bumble shook his head with gloomy mystery , and said he wished he might come to good ; whereunto Mr. Gamfield replied , that he wished he might come to him ; which , although he agreed with the beadle in most matters , would seem to be a wish of a totaly opposite description .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 33]: The next morning , the public were once informed that Oliver Twist was again To Let , and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would take possession of him .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 61]: CHAPTER IV OLIVER , BEING OFFERED ANOTHER PLACE , MAKES HIS FIRST ENTRY INTO PUBLIC LIFE In great families , when an advantageous place can not be obtained , either in possession , reversion , remainder , or expectancy , for the young man who is growing up , it is a very general custom to send him to sea .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 37]: The board , in imitation of so wise and salutary an example , took counsel together on the expediency of shipping off Oliver Twist , in some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 71]: This suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done with him : the probability being , that the skipper would flog him to death , in a playful mood , some day after dinner , or would knock his brains out with an iron bar ; both pastimes being , as is pretty generally known , very favourite and common recreations among gentleman of that class .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 52]: The more the case presented itself to the board , in this point of view , the more manifold the advantages of the step appeared ; so , they came to the conclusion that the only way of providing for Oliver effectually , was to send him to sea without delay .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 62]: Mr. Bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries , with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a cabin-boy without any friends ; and was returning to the workhouse to communicate the result of his mission ; when he encountered at the gate , no less a person than Mr. Sowerberry , the parochial undertaker .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 32]: Mr. Sowerberry was a tall gaunt , large-jointed man , attired in a suit of threadbare black , with darned cotton stockings of the same colour , and shoes to answer .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 23]: His features were not naturally intended to wear a smiling aspect , but he was in general rather given to professional jocosity .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 28]: His step was elastic , and his face betokened inward pleasantry , as he advanced to Mr. Bumble , and shook him cordially by the hand . '
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 22]: I have taken the measure of the two women that died last night , Mr. Bumble , ' said the undertaker .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 42]: ` You 'll make your fortune , Mr. Sowerberry , ' said the beadle , as he thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proferred snuff-box of the undertaker : which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin . '
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 32]: I say you 'll make your fortune , Mr. Sowerberry , ' repeated Mr. Bumble , tapping the undertaker on the shoulder , in a friendly manner , with his cane .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 5]: ` Think so ? '
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 18]: said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half disputed the probability of the event .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 15]: ` The prices allowed by the board are very small , Mr. Bumble . '
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 29]: ` So are the coffins , ' replied the beadle : with precisely as near an approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 24]: Mr. Sowerberry was much tickled at this : as of course he ought to be ; and laughed a long time without cessation .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 55]: ` Well , well , Mr. Bumble , ' he said at length , ` there 's no denying that , since the new system of feeding has come in , the coffins are something narrower and more shallow than they used to be ; but we must have some profit , Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 23]: Well-seasoned timber is an expensive article , sir ; and all the iron handles come , by canal , from Birmingham . '
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 17]: ` Well , well , ' said Mr. Bumble , ` every trade has its drawbacks .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 11]: A fair profit is , of course , allowable . '
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 43]: ` Of course , of course , ' replied the undertaker ; ` and if I do n't get a profit upon this or that particular article , why , I make it up in the long-run , you see -- he !
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 2]: he !
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 3]: he ! '
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 9]: ` Just so , ' said Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 55]: ` Though I must say , ' continued the undertaker , resuming the current of observations which the beadle had interrupted : ` though I must say , Mr. Bumble , that I have to contend against one very great disadvantage : which is , that all the stout people go off the quickest .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 68]: The people who have been better off , and have paid rates for many years , are the first to sink when they come into the house ; and let me tell you , Mr. Bumble , that three or four inches over one 's calculation makes a great hole in one 's profits : especially when one has a family to provide for , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 46]: As Mr. Sowerberry said this , with the becoming indignation of an ill-used man ; and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a reflection on the honour of the parish ; the latter gentleman thought it advisable to change the subject .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 14]: Oliver Twist being uppermost in his mind , he made him his theme .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 24]: ` By the bye , ' said Mr. Bumble , ` you do n't know anybody who wants a boy , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 25]: A porochial ` prentis , who is at present a dead-weight ; a millstone , as I may say , round the porochial throat ?
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 10]: Liberal terms , Mr. Sowerberry , liberal terms ? '
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 39]: As Mr. Bumble spoke , he raised his cane to the bill above him , and gave three distinct raps upon the words ` five pounds ' : which were printed thereon in Roman capitals of gigantic size .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 4]: ` Gadso ! '
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 31]: said the undertaker : taking Mr. Bumble by the gilt-edged lappel of his official coat ; ` that 's just the very thing I wanted to speak to you about .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 17]: You know -- dear me , what a very elegant button this is , Mr. Bumble !
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 7]: I never noticed it before . '
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 27]: ` Yes , I think it rather pretty , ' said the beadle , glancing proudly downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 21]: ` The die is the same as the porochial seal -- the Good Samaritan healing the sick and bruised man .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 14]: The board presented it to me on Newyear 's morning , Mr. Sowerberry .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 32]: I put it on , I remember , for the first time , to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman , who died in a doorway at midnight . ' '
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 8]: I recollect , ' said the undertaker .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 30]: ` The jury brought it in , `` Died from exposure to the cold , and want of the common necessaries of life , '' did n't they ? '
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 4]: Mr. Bumble nodded .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 37]: ` And they made it a special verdict , I think , ' said the undertaker , ` by adding some words to the effect , that if the relieving officer had -- ' ` Tush !
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 3]: Foolery ! '
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 4]: interposed the beadle .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 22]: ` If the board attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk , they 'd have enough to do . '
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 15]: ` Very true , ' said the undertaker ; ` they would indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 34]: ` Juries , ' said Mr. Bumble , grasping his cane tightly , as was his wont when working into a passion : ` juries is ineddicated , vulgar , grovelling wretches . '
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 10]: ` So they are , ' said the undertaker .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 25]: ` They have n't no more philosophy nor political economy about 'em than that , ' said the beadle , snapping his fingers contemptuously .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 12]: ` No more they have , ' acquiesced the undertaker . '
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 16]: I despise 'em , ' said the beadle , growing very red in the face .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 10]: ` So do I , ' rejoined the undertaker .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 46]: ` And I only wish we 'd a jury of the independent sort , in the house for a week or two , ' said the beadle ; ` the rules and regulations of the board would soon bring their spirit down for 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 12]: ` Let 'em alone for that , ' replied the undertaker .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 19]: So saying , he smiled , approvingly : to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish officer .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 59]: Mr Bumble lifted off his cocked hat ; took a handkerchief from the inside of the crown ; wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his rage had engendered ; fixed the cocked hat on again ; and , turning to the undertaker , said in a calmer voice : ` Well ; what about the boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 24]: replied the undertaker ; why , you know , Mr. Bumble , I pay a good deal towards the poor 's rates . '
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 4]: ` Hem ! '
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 4]: said Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 4]: ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 52]: ` Well , ' replied the undertaker , ' I was thinking that if I pay so much towards 'em , I 've a right to get as much out of 'em as I can , Mr. Bumble ; and so -- I think I 'll take the boy myself . '
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 16]: Mr. Bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm , and led him into the building .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 87]: Mr. Sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes ; and it was arranged that Oliver should go to him that evening ` upon liking ' -- a phrase which means , in the case of a parish apprentice , that if the master find , upon a short trial , that he can get enough work out of a boy without putting too much food into him , he shall have him for a term of years , to do what he likes with .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 101]: When little Oliver was taken before ` the gentlemen ' that evening ; and informed that he was to go , that night , as general house-lad to a coffin-maker 's ; and that if he complained of his situation , or ever came back to the parish again , he would be sent to sea , there to be drowned , or knocked on the head , as the case might be , he evinced so little emotion , that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened young rascal , and orered Mr. Bumble to remove him forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 53]: Now , although it was very natural that the board , of all people in the world , should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody , they were rather out , in this particular instance .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 49]: The simple fact was , that Oliver , instead of possessing too little feeling , possessed rather too much ; and was in a fair way of being reduced , for life , to a state of brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 89]: He heard the news of his destination , in perfect silence ; and , having had his luggage put into his hand -- which was not very difficult to carry , inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown paper parcel , about half a foot square by three inches deep -- he pulled his cap over his eyes ; and once more attaching himself to Mr. Bumble 's coat cuff , was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 69]: For some time , Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along , without notice or remark ; for the beadle carried his head very erect , as a beadle always should : and , it being a windy day , little Oliver was completely enshrouded by the skirts of Mr. Bumble 's coat as they blew open , and disclosed to great advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee-breeches .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 50]: As they drew near to their destination , however , Mr. Bumble thought it expedient to look down , and see that the boy was in good order for inspection by his new master : which he accordingly did , with a fit and becoming air of gracious patronage .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 4]: ` Oliver ! '
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 4]: said Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 16]: ` Yes , sir , ' replied Oliver , in a low , tremulous voice .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 17]: ` Pull that cap off your eyes , and hold up your head , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 38]: Although Oliver did as he was desired , at once ; and passed the back of his unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes , he left a tear in them when he looked up at his conductor .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 14]: As Mr. Bumble gazed sternly upon him , it rolled down his cheek .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 9]: It was followed by another , and another .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 14]: The child made a strong effort , but it was an unsuccessful one .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 30]: Withdrawing his other hand from Mr. Bumble 's he covered his face with both ; and wept until the tears sprung out from between his chin and bony fingers .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 19]: exclaimed Mr. Bumble , stopping short , and darting at his little charge a look of intense malignity .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 62]: Of ALL the ungratefullest , and worst-disposed boys as ever I see , Oliver , you are the -- ' ` No , no , sir , ' sobbed Oliver , clinging to the hand which held the well-known cane ; ` no , no , sir ; I will be good indeed ; indeed , indeed I will , sir !
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 22]: I am a very little boy , sir ; and it is so -- so -- ' ` So what ? '
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 6]: inquired Mr. Bumble in amazement .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 6]: ` So lonely , sir !
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 5]: So very lonely ! '
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 4]: cried the child .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 5]: ` Everybody hates me .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 14]: sir , do n't , do n't pray be cross to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 23]: The child beat his hand upon his heart ; and looked in his companion 's face , with tears of real agony .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 51]: Mr. Bumble regarded Oliver 's piteous and helpless look , with some astonishment , for a few seconds ; hemmed three or four times in a husky manner ; and after muttering something about ` that troublesome cough , ' bade Oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 15]: Then once more taking his hand , he walked on with him in silence .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 35]: The undertaker , who had just putup the shutters of his shop , was making some entries in his day-book by the light of a most appropriate dismal candle , when Mr. Bumble entered .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 4]: ` Aha ! '
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 27]: said the undertaker ; looking up from the book , and pausing in the middle of a word ; ` is that you , Bumble ? '
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 13]: ` No one else , Mr. Sowerberry , ' replied the beadle .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 3]: ` Here !
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 7]: I 've brought the boy . '
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 5]: Oliver made a bow .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 9]: that 's the boy , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 19]: said the undertaker : raising the candle above his head , to get a better view of Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 19]: ` Mrs. Sowerberry , will you have the goodness to come here a moment , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 29]: Mrs. Sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop , and presented the form of a short , then , squeezed-up woman , with a vixenish countenance .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 26]: ` My dear , ' said Mr. Sowerberry , deferentially , ` this is the boy from the workhouse that I told you of . '
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 4]: Oliver bowed again .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 13]: said the undertaker 's wife , ` he 's very small . '
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 33]: ` Why , he IS rather small , ' replied Mr. Bumble : looking at Oliver as if it were his fault that he was no bigger ; ` he is small .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 6]: There 's no denying it .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 13]: But he 'll grow , Mrs. Sowerberry -- he 'll grow . '
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 20]: I dare say he will , ' replied the lady pettishly , ` on our victuals and our drink .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 24]: I see no saving in parish children , not I ; for they always cost more to keep , than they 're worth .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 9]: However , men always think they know best .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 10]: Get downstairs , little bag o ' bones . '
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 65]: With this , the undertaker 's wife opened a side door , and pushed Oliver down a steep flight of stairs into a stone cell , damp and dark : forming the ante-room to the coal-cellar , and denominated ` kitchen ' ; wherein sat a slatternly girl , in shoes down at heel , and blue worsted stockings very much out of repair .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 32]: ` Here , Charlotte , ' said Mr. Sowerberry , who had followed Oliver down , ` give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for Trip .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 16]: He has n't come home since the morning , so he may go without 'em .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 19]: I dare say the boy is n't too dainty to eat 'em -- are you , boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 39]: Oliver , whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat , and who was trembling with eagerness to devour it , replied in the negative ; and a plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 42]: I wish some well-fed philosopher , whose meat and drink turn to gall within him ; whose blood is ice , whose heart is iron ; could have seen Oliver Twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 23]: I wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which Oliver tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 31]: There is only one thing I should like better ; and that would be to see the Philosopher making the same sort of meal himself , with the same relish .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 40]: ` Well , ' said the undertaker 's wife , when Oliver had finished his supper : which she had regarded in silent horror , and with fearful auguries of his future appetite : ` have you done ? '
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 14]: There being nothing eatable within his reach , Oliver replied in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 33]: ` Then come with me , ' said Mrs. Sowerberry : taking up a dim and dirty lamp , and leading the way upstairs ; ` your bed 's under the counter .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 12]: You do n't mind sleeping among the coffins , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 21]: But it does n't much matter whether you do or do n't , for you ca n't sleep anywhere else .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 11]: Come ; do n't keep me here all night ! '
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 12]: Oliver lingered no longer , but meekly followed his new mistress .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 8]: CHAPTER V OLIVER MINGLES WITH NEW ASSOCIATES .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 71]: GOING TO A FUNERAL FOR THE FIRST TIME , HE FORMS AN UNFAVOURABLE NOTION OF HIS MASTER 'S BUSINESS Oliver , being left to himself in the undertaker 's shop , set the lamp down on a workman 's bench , and gazed timidly about him with a feeling of awe and dread , which many people a good deal older than he will be at no loss to understand .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 64]: An unfinished coffin on black tressels , which stood in the middle of the shop , looked so gloomy and death-like that a cold tremble came over him , every time his eyes wandered in the direction of the dismal object : from which he almost expected to see some frightful form slowly rear its head , to drive him mad with terror .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 39]: Against the wall were ranged , in regular array , a long row of elm boards cut in the same shape : looking in the dim light , like high-shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 61]: Coffin-plates , elm-chips , bright-headed nails , and shreds of black cloth , lay scattered on the floor ; and the wall behind the counter was ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff neckcloths , on duty at a large private door , with a hearse drawn by four black steeds , approaching in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 7]: The shop was close and hot .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 10]: The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 18]: The recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust , looked like a grave .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 11]: Nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 28]: He was alone in a strange place ; and we all know how chilled and desolate the best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 15]: The boy had no friends to care for , or to care for him .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 26]: The regret of no recent separation was fresh in his mind ; the absence of no loved and well-remembered face sank heavily into his heart .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 68]: But his heart was heavy , notwithstanding ; and he wished , as he crept into his narrow bed , that that were his coffin , and that he could be lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground , with the tall grass waving gently above his head , and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe him in his sleep .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 42]: Oliver was awakened in the morning , by a loud kicking at the outside of the shop-door : which , before he could huddle on his clothes , was repeated , in an angry and impetuous manner , about twenty-five times .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 17]: When he began to undo the chain , the legs desisted , and a voice began .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 9]: ` Open the door , will yer ? '
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 16]: cried the voice which belonged to the legs which had kicked at the door . '
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 21]: I will , directly , sir , ' replied Oliver : undoing the chain , and turning the key . '
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 12]: I suppose yer the new boy , ai n't yer ? '
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 7]: said the voice through the key-hole .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 9]: ` Yes , sir , ' replied Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 7]: ` How old are yer ? '
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 4]: inquired the voice .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 9]: ` Ten , sir , ' replied Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 36]: ` Then I 'll whop yer when I get in , ' said the voice ; ` you just see if I do n't , that 's all , my work ` us brat ! '
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 13]: and having made this obliging promise , the voice began to whistle .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 45]: Oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference , to entertain the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice , whoever he might be , would redeem his pledge , most honourably .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 15]: He drew back the bolts with a trembling hand , and opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 101]: For a second or two , Oliver glanced up the street , and down the street , and over the way : impressed with the belief that the unknown , who had addressed him through the key-hole , had walked a few paces off , to warm himself ; for nobody did he see but a big charity-boy , sitting on a post in front of the house , eating a slice of bread and butter : which he cut into wedges , the size of his mouth , with a clasp-knife , and then consumed with great dexterity . '
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 29]: I beg your pardon , sir , ' said Oliver at length : seeing that no other visitor made his appearance ; ` did you knock ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 8]: I kicked , ' replied the charity-boy .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 10]: ` Did you want a coffin , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 5]: inquired Oliver , innocently .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 30]: At this , the charity-boy looked monstrous fierce ; and said that Oliver would want one before long , if he cut jokes with his superiors in that way .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 17]: ` Yer do n't know who I am , I suppose , Work ` us ? '
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 21]: said the charity-boy , in continuation : descending from the top of the post , meanwhile , with edifying gravity .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 9]: ` No , sir , ' rejoined Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 19]: ` I 'm Mister Noah Claypole , ' said the charity-boy , ` and you 're under me .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 11]: Take down the shutters , yer idle young ruffian ! '
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 26]: With this , Mr. Claypole administered a kick to Oliver , and entered the shop with a dignified air , which did him great credit .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 45]: It is difficult for a large-headed , small-eyed youth , of lumbering make and heavy countenance , to look dignified under any circumstances ; but it is more especially so , when superadded to these personal attractions are a red nose and yellow smalls .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 72]: Oliver , having taken down the shutters , and broken a pane of glass in his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the day , was graciously assisted by Noah : who having consoled him with the assurance that ` he 'd catch it , ' condescended to help him .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 7]: Mr. Sowerberry came down soon after .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 7]: Shortly afterwards , Mrs. Sowerberry appeared .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 24]: Oliver having ` caught it , ' in fulfilment of Noah 's prediction , followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 13]: ` Come near the fire , Noah , ' said Charlotte . '
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 15]: I saved a nice little bit of bacon for you from master 's breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 27]: Oliver , shut that door at Mister Noah 's back , and take them bits that I 've put out on the cover of the bread-pan .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 31]: There 's your tea ; take it away to that box , and drink it there , and make haste , for they 'll want you to mind the shop .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 4]: D'ye hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 10]: 'D ` ye hear , Work ` us ? '
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 4]: said Noah Claypole .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 6]: ` Lor , Noah ! '
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 11]: said Charlotte , ` what a rum creature you are !
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 10]: Why do n't you let the boy alone ? '
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 6]: ` Let him alone ! '
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 3]: said Noah .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 14]: ` Why everybody lets him alone enough , for the matter of that .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 12]: Neither his father nor his mother will ever interfere with him .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 12]: All his relations let him have his own way pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 4]: Eh , Charlotte ?
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 2]: He !
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 2]: he !
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 3]: he ! '
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 8]: ` Oh , you queer soul ! '
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 56]: said Charlotte , bursting into a hearty laugh , in which she was joined by Noah ; after which they both looked scornfully at poor Oliver Twist , as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest corner of the room , and ate the stale pieces which had been specially reserved for him .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 11]: Noah was a charity-boy , but not a workhouse orphan .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 54]: No chance-child was he , for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his parents , who lived hard by ; his mother being a washerwoman , and his father a drunken soldier , discharged with a wooden leg , and a diurnal pension of twopence-halfpenny and an unstateable fraction .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 44]: The shop-boys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding Noah in the public streets , with the ignominious epithets of ` leathers , ' ` charity , ' and the like ; and Noah had bourne them without reply .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 33]: But , now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan , at whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn , he retorted on him with interest .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 7]: This affords charming food for contemplation .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 33]: It shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be ; and how impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest charity-boy .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 15]: Oliver had been sojourning at the undertaker 's some three weeks or a month .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 63]: Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry -- the shop being shut up -- were taking their supper in the little back-parlour , when Mr. Sowerberry , after several deferential glances at his wife , said , ` My dear -- ' He was going to say more ; but , Mrs. Sowerberry looking up , with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect , he stopped short .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 10]: ` Well , ' said Mrs. Sowerberry , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 13]: ` Nothing , my dear , nothing , ' said Mr. Sowerberry .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 7]: ` Ugh , you brute ! '
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 4]: said Mrs. Sowerberry .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 15]: ` Not at all , my dear , ' said Mr. Sowerberry humbly . '
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 12]: I thought you did n't want to hear , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 28]: I was only going to say -- ' ` Oh , do n't tell me what you were going to say , ' interposed Mrs. Sowerberry . '
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 11]: I am nobody ; do n't consult me , pray .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 11]: I do n't want to intrude upon your secrets . '
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 17]: As Mrs. Sowerberry said this , she gave an hysterical laugh , which threatened violent consequences .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 19]: ` But , my dear , ' said Sowerberry , ' I want to ask your advice . '
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 27]: ` No , no , do n't ask mine , ' replied Mrs. Sowerberry , in an affecting manner : ` ask somebody else 's . '
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 15]: Here , there was another hysterical laugh , which frightened Mr. Sowerberry very much .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 45]: This is a very common and much-approved matrimonial course of treatment , which is often very effective It at once reduced Mr. Sowerberry to begging , as a special favour , to be allowed to say what Mrs. Sowerberry was most curious to hear .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 12]: After a short duration , the permission was most graciously conceded .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 17]: ` It 's only about young Twist , my dear , ' said Mr. Sowerberry . '
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 11]: A very good-looking boy , that , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 15]: ` He need be , for he eats enough , ' observed the lady .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 25]: ` There 's an expression of melancholy in his face , my dear , ' resumed Mr. Sowerberry , ` which is very interesting .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 11]: He would make a delightful mute , my love . '
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 11]: Mrs. Sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable wonderment .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 22]: Mr. Sowerberry remarked it and , without allowing time for any observation on the good lady 's part , proceeded . '
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 22]: I do n't mean a regular mute to attend grown-up people , my dear , but only for children 's practice .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 15]: It would be very new to have a mute in proportion , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 14]: You may depend upon it , it would have a superb effect . '
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 68]: Mrs. Sowerberry , who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way , was much struck by the novelty of this idea ; but , as it would have been compromising her dignity to have said so , under existing circumstances , she merely inquired , with much sharpness , why such an obvious suggestion had not presented itself to her husband 's mind before ?
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 57]: Mr. Sowerberry rightly construed this , as an acquiescence in his proposition ; it was speedily determined , therefore , that Oliver should be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade ; and , with this view , that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of his services being required .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 8]: The occasion was not long in coming .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 46]: Half an hour after breakfast next morning , Mr. Bumble entered the shop ; and supporting his cane against the counter , drew forth his large leathern pocket-book : from which he selected a small scrap of paper , which he handed over to Sowerberry .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 4]: ` Aha ! '
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 22]: said the undertaker , glancing over it with a lively countenance ; ` an order for a coffin , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 34]: ` For a coffin first , and a porochial funeral afterwards , ' replied Mr. Bumble , fastening the strap of the leathern pocket-book : which , like himself , was very corpulent .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 19]: ` Bayton , ' said the undertaker , looking from the scrap of paper to Mr. Bumble . '
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 8]: I never heard the name before . '
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 19]: Bumble shook his head , as he replied , ` Obstinate people , Mr. Sowerberry ; very obstinate .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 11]: Proud , too , I 'm afraid , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 6]: ` Proud , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 7]: exclaimed Mr. Sowerberry with a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 9]: ` Come , that 's too much . '
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 12]: ` Oh , it 's sickening , ' replied the beadle .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 7]: ` Antimonial , Mr. Sowerberry ! '
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 10]: ` So it is , ' asquiesced the undertaker .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 62]: ` We only heard of the family the night before last , ' said the beadle ; ` and we should n't have known anything about them , then , only a woman who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was very bad .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 30]: He had gone out to dinner ; but his ` prentice -LRB- which is a very clever lad -RRB- sent 'em some medicine in a blacking-bottle , offhand . '
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 12]: ` Ah , there 's promptness , ' said the undertaker .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 6]: ` Promptness , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 4]: replied the beadle .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 18]: ` But what 's the consequence ; what 's the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 35]: Why , the husband sends back word that the medicine wo n't suit his wife 's complaint , and so she sha n't take it -- says she sha n't take it , sir !
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 55]: Good , strong , wholesome medicine , as was given with great success to two Irish labourers and a coal-heaver , ony a week before -- sent 'em for nothing , with a blackin ' - bottle in , -- and he sends back word that she sha n't take it , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 29]: As the atrocity presented itself to Mr. Bumble 's mind in full force , he struck the counter sharply with his cane , and became flushed with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 24]: ` Well , ' said the undertaker , ' I ne -- ver -- did -- ' ` Never did , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 4]: ejaculated the beadle .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 38]: ` No , nor nobody never did ; but now she 's dead , we 've got to bury her ; and that 's the direction ; and the sooner it 's done , the better . '
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 28]: Thus saying , Mr. Bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first , in a fever of parochial excietment ; and flounced out of the shop .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 20]: ` Why , he was so angry , Oliver , that he forgot even to ask after you ! '
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 15]: said Mr. Sowerberry , looking after the beadle as he strode down the street .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 43]: ` Yes , sir , ' replied Oliver , who had carefully kept himself out of sight , during the interview ; and who was shaking from head to foot at the mere recollection of the sound of Mr. Bumble 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 89]: He need n't haven taken the trouble to shrink from Mr. Bumble 's glance , however ; for that functionary , on whom the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression , thought that now the undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better avoided , until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years , and all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish should be thus effectually and legally overcome .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 13]: ` Well , ' said Mr. Sowerberry , taking up his hat .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 11]: ` the sooner this job is done , the better .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 7]: Noah , look after the shop .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 13]: Oliver , put on your cap , and come with me . '
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 12]: Oliver obeyed , and followed his master on his professional mission .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 54]: They walked on , for some time , through the most crowded and densely inhabited part of the town ; and then , striking down a narrow street more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through , paused to look for the house which was the object of their search .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 61]: The houses on either side were high and large , but very old , and tenanted by people of the poorest class : as their neglected appearance would have sufficiently dentoed , without the concurrent testimony afforded by the squalid looks of the few men and women who , with folded arms and bodies half doubled , occasionally skulked along .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 26]: A great many of the tenements had shop-fronts ; but these were fast closed , and mouldering away ; only the upper rooms being inhabited .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 90]: Some houses which had become insecure from age and decay , were prevented from falling into the street , by huge beams of wood reared against the walls , and firmly planted in the road ; but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches , for many of the rough boards which supplied the place of door and window , were wrenched from their positions , to afford an aperture wide enough for the passage of a human body .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 7]: The kennel was stagnant and filthy .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 19]: The very rats , which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness , were hideous with famine .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 52]: There was neither knocker nor bell-handle at the open door where Oliver and his master stopped ; so , groping his way cautiously through the dark passage , and bidding Oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 16]: Stumbling against a door on the landing , he rapped at it with his knuckles .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 12]: It was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 25]: The undertaker at once saw enough of what the room contained , to know it was the apartment to which he had been directed .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 8]: He stepped in ; Oliver followed him .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 21]: There was no fire in the room ; but a man was crouching , mechanically , over the empty stove .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 22]: An old woman , too , had drawn a low stool to the cold hearth , and was sitting beside him .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 32]: There were some ragged children in another corner ; and in a small recess , opposite the door , there lay upon the ground , something covered with an old blanket .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 35]: Oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place , and crept involuntarily closer to his master ; for though it was covered up , the boy felt that it was a corpse .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 22]: The man 's face was thin and very pale ; his hair and beard were grizzly ; his eyes were blookshot .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 26]: The old woman 's face was wrinkled ; her two remaining teeth protruded over her under lip ; and her eyes were bright and piercing .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 12]: Oliver was afriad to look at either her or the man .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 11]: They seemed so like the rats he had seen outside .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 23]: ` Nobody shall go near her , ' said the man , starting fiercely up , as the undertaker approached the recess .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 4]: ` Keep back !
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 15]: Damn you , keep back , if you 've a life to lose ! '
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 24]: ` Nonsense , my good man , ' said the undertaker , who was pretty well used to misery in all its shapes .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 5]: ` Nonsense ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 35]: I tell you , ' said the man : clenching his hands , and stamping furiously on the floor , -- ' I tell you I wo n't have her put into the ground .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 6]: She could n't rest there .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 17]: The worms would worry her -- not eat her -- she is so worn away . '
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 29]: The undertaker offered no reply to this raving ; but producing a tape from his pocket , knelt down for a moment by the side of the body .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 42]: said the man : bursting into tears , and sinking on his knees at the feet of the dead woman ; ` kneel down , kneel down -- kneel round her , every one of you , and mark my words !
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 8]: I say she was starved to death .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 25]: I never knew how bad she was , till the fever came upon her ; and then her bones were starting through the skin .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 17]: There was neither fire nor candle ; she died in the dark -- in the dark !
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 19]: She could n't even see her children 's faces , though we heard her gasping out their names .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 15]: I begged for her in the streets : and they sent me to prison .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 27]: When I came back , she was dying ; and all the blood in my heart has dried up , for they starved her to death .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 10]: I swear it before the God that saw it !
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 5]: They starved her ! '
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 32]: He twined his hands in his hair ; and , with a loud scream , rolled grovelling upon the floor : his eyes fixed , and the foam covering his lips .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 34]: The terrified children cried bitterly ; but the old woman , who had hitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that passed , menaced them into silence .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 21]: Having unloosened the cravat of the man who still remained extended on the ground , she tottered towards the undertaker .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 42]: ` She was my daughter , ' said the old woman , nodding her head in the direction of the corpse ; and speaking with an idiotic leer , more ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 5]: ` Lord , Lord !
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 36]: Well , it IS strange that I who gave birth to her , and was a woman then , should be alive and merry now , and she lying ther : so cold and stiff !
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 4]: Lord , Lord !
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 21]: -- to think of it ; it 's as good as a play -- as good as a play ! '
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 19]: As the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment , the undertaker turned to go away .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 6]: ` Stop , stop ! '
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 9]: said the old woman in a loud whisper .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 14]: ` Will she be buried to-morrow , or next day , or to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 13]: I laid her out ; and I must walk , you know .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 17]: Send me a large cloak : a good warm one : for it is bitter cold .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 13]: We should have cake and wine , too , before we go !
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 18]: Never mind ; send some bread -- only a loaf of bread and a cup of water .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 9]: Shall we have some bread , dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 20]: she said eagerly : catching at the undertaker 's coat , as he once more moved towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 14]: ` Yes , yes , ' said the undertaker , ` of course .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 5]: Anything you like ! '
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 20]: He disengaged himself from the old woman 's grasp ; and , drawing Oliver after him , hurried away .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 62]: The next day , -LRB- the family having been meanwhile relieved with a half-quartern loaf and a piece of cheese , left with them by Mr. Bumble himself , -RRB- Oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode ; where Mr. Bumble had already arrived , accompanied by four men from the workhouse , who were to act as bearers .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 42]: An old black cloak had been thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man ; and the bare coffin having been screwed down , was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers , and carried into the street .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 15]: ` Now , you must put your best leg foremost , old lady ! '
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 27]: whispered Sowerberry in the old woman 's ear ; ` we are rather late ; and it wo n't do , to keep the clergyman waiting .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 14]: Move on , my men , -- as quick as you like ! '
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 25]: Thus directed , the bearers trotted on under their light burden ; and the two mourners kept as near them , as they could .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 32]: Mr. Bumble and Sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front ; and Oliver , whose legs were not so long as his master 's , ran by the side .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 80]: There was not so great a necessity for hurrying as Mr. Sowerberry had anticipated , however ; for when they reached the obscure corner of the churchyard in which the nettles grew , and where the parish graves were made , the clergyman had not arrived ; and the clerk , who was sitting by the vestry-room fire , seemed to think it by no means improbable that it might be an hour or so , before he came .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 66]: So , they put the bier on the brink of the grave ; and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp clay , with a cold rain drizzling down , while the ragged boys whom the spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at hide-and-seek among the tombstones , or varied their amusements by jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 24]: Mr. Sowerberry and Bumble , being personal friends of the clerk , sat by the fire with him , and read the paper .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 30]: At length , after a lapse of something more than an hour , Mr. Bumble , and Sowerberry , and the clerk , were seen running towards the grave .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 16]: Immediately afterwards , the clergyman appeared : putting on his surplice as he came along .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 47]: Mr. Bumble then thrashed a boy or two , to keep up appearances ; and the reverend gentleman , having read as much of the burial service as could be compressed into four minutes , gave his surplice to the clerk , and walked away again .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 6]: ` Now , Bill ! '
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 6]: said Sowerberry to the grave-digger .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 5]: ` Fill up ! '
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 27]: It was no very difficult task , for the grave was so full , that the uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 41]: The grave-digger shovelled in the earth ; stamped it loosely down with his feet : shouldered his spade ; and walked off , followed by the boys , who murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 8]: ` Come , my good fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 10]: said Bumble , tapping the man on the back .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 10]: ` They want to shut up the yard . '
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 48]: The man who had never once moved , since he had taken his station by the grave side , started , raised his head , stared at the person who had addressed him , walked forward for a few paces ; and fell down in a swoon .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 66]: The crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss of her cloak -LRB- which the undertaker had taken off -RRB- , to pay him any attention ; so they threw a can of cold water over him ; and when he came to , saw him safely out of the churchyard , locked the gate , and departed on their different ways .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 22]: ` Well , Oliver , ' said Sowerberry , as they walked home , ` how do you like it ? '
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 16]: ` Pretty well , thank you , sir ' replied Oliver , with considerable hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 8]: ` Not very much , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 18]: ` Ah , you 'll get used to it in time , Oliver , ' said Sowerberry .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 13]: ` Nothing when you ARE used to it , my boy . '
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 24]: Oliver wondered , in his own mind , whether it had taken a very long time to get Mr. Sowerberry used to it .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 27]: But he thought it better not to ask the question ; and walked back to the shop : thinking over all he had seen and heard .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 31]: CHAPTER VI OLIVER , BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH , ROUSES INTO ACTION , AND RATHER ASTONISHES HIM The month 's trial over , Oliver was formally apprenticed .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 11]: It was a nice sickly season just at this time .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 27]: In commercial phrase , coffins were looking up ; and , in the course of a few weeks , Oliver acquired a great deal of experience .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 16]: The success of Mr. Sowerberry 's ingenious speculation , exceeded even his most sanguine hopes .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 55]: The oldest inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so prevalent , or so fatal to infant existence ; and many were the mournful processions which little Oliver headed , in a hat-band reaching down to his knees , to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the mothers in the town .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 58]: As Oliver accompanied his master in most of his adult expeditions too , in order that he might acquire that equanimity of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a finished undertaker , he had many opportunities of observing the beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong-minded people bear their trials and losses .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 90]: For instance ; when Sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich old lady or gentleman , who was surrounded by a great number of nephews and nieces , who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous illness , and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most public occasions , they would be as happy among themselves as need be -- quite cheerful and contented -- conversing together with as much freedom and gaiety , as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb them .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 16]: Husbands , too , bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic calmness .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 40]: Wives , again , put on weeds for their husbands , as if , so far from grieving in the garb of sorrow , they had made up their minds to render it as becoming and attractive as possible .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 41]: It was observable , too , that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during the ceremony of interment , recovered almost as soon as they reached home , and became quite composed before the tea-drinking was over .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 18]: All this was very pleasant and improving to see ; and Oliver beheld it with great admiration .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 101]: That Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good people , I can not , although I am his biographer , undertake to affirm with any degree of confidence ; but I can most distinctly say , that for many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and ill-treatment of Noah Claypole : who used him far worse than before , now that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the black stick and hatband , while he , the old one , remained stationary in the muffin-cap and leathers .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 74]: Charlotte treated him ill , because Noah did ; and Mrs. Sowerberry was his decided enemy , because Mr. Sowerberry was disposed to be his friend ; so , between these three on one side , and a glut of funerals on the other , Oliver was not altogether as comfortable as the hungry pig was , when he was shut up , by mistake , in the grain department of a brewery .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 45]: And now , I come to a very important passage in Oliver 's history ; for I have to record an act , slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance , but which indirectly produced a material change in all his future prospects and proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 82]: One day , Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual dinner-hour , to banquet upon a small joint of mutton -- a pound and a half of the worst end of the neck -- when Charlotte being called out of the way , there ensued a brief interval of time , which Noah Claypole , being hungry and vicious , considered he could not possibly devote to a worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 76]: Intent upon this innocent amusement , Noah put his feet on the table-cloth ; and pulled Oliver 's hair ; and twitched his ears ; and expressed his opinion that he was a ` sneak ' ; and furthermore announced his intention of coming to see him hanged , whenever that desirable event should take place ; and entered upon various topics of petty annoyance , like a malicious and ill-conditioned charity-boy as he was .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 35]: But , making Oliver cry , Noah attempted to be more facetious still ; and in his attempt , did what many sometimes do to this day , when they want to be funny .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 5]: He got rather personal .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 16]: ` Work ` us , ' said Noah , ` how 's your mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 21]: ` She 's dead , ' replied Oliver ; ` do n't you say anything about her to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 41]: Oliver 's colour rose as he said this ; he breathed quickly ; and there was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils , which Mr. Claypole thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 9]: Under this impression he returned to the charge .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 12]: ` What did she die of , Work ` us ? '
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 3]: said Noah .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 32]: ` Of a broken heart , some of our old nurses told me , ' replied Oliver : more as if he were talking to himself , than answering Noah . '
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 14]: I think I know what it must be to die of that ! '
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 28]: ` Tol de rol lol lol , right fol lairy , Work ` us , ' said Noah , as a tear rolled down Oliver 's cheek .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 10]: ` What 's set you a snivelling now ? '
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 10]: ` Not YOU , ' replied Oliver , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 7]: ` There ; that 's enough .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 16]: Do n't say anything more to me about her ; you 'd better not ! '
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 5]: ` Better not ! '
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 3]: exclaimed Noah .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 3]: Better not !
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 9]: Work ` us , do n't be impudent .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 5]: YOUR mother , too !
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 9]: She was a nice ` un she was .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 5]: Oh , Lor ! '
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 30]: And here , Noah nodded his head expressively ; and curled up as much of his small red nose as muscular action could collect together , for the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 82]: ` Yer know , Work ` us , ' continued Noah , emboldened by Oliver 's silence , and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity : of all tones the most annoying : ` Yer know , Work ` us , it ca n't be helped now ; and of course yer could n't help it then ; and I am very sorry for it ; and I 'm sure we all are , and pity yer very much .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 20]: But yer must know , Work ` us , yer mother was a regular right-down bad ` un . '
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 7]: ` What did you say ? '
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 9]: inquired Oliver , looking up very quickly . '
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 17]: A regular right-down bad ` un , Work ` us , ' replied Noah , coolly .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 49]: ` And it 's a great deal better , Work ` us , that she died when she did , or else she 'd have been hard labouring in Bridewell , or transported , or hung ; which is more likely than either , is n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 54]: Crimson with fury , Oliver started up ; overthrew the chair and table ; seized Noah by the throat ; shook him , in the violence of his rage , till his teeth chattered in his head ; and collecting his whole force into one heavy blow , felled him to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 23]: A minute ago , the boy had looked the quiet child , mild , dejected creature that harsh treatment had made him .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 22]: But his spirit was roused at last ; the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 48]: His breast heaved ; his attitude was erect ; his eye bright and vivid ; his whole person changed , as he stood glaring over the cowardly tormentor who now lay crouching at his feet ; and defied him with an energy he had never known before .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 7]: ` He 'll murder me ! '
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 3]: blubbered Noah .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 3]: ` Charlotte !
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 2]: missis !
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 10]: Here 's the new boy a murdering of me !
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 2]: Help !
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 2]: help !
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 5]: Oliver 's gone mad !
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 5]: Char -- lotte ! '
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 61]: Noah 's shouts were responded to , by a loud scream from Charlotte , and a louder from Mrs. Sowerberry ; the former of whom rushed into the kitchen by a side-door , while the latter paused on the staircase till she was quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human life , to come further down .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 8]: ` Oh , you little wretch ! '
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 26]: screamed Charlotte : seizing Oliver with her utmost force , which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man in particularly good training .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 13]: ` Oh , you little un-grate-ful , mur-de-rous , hor-rid villain ! '
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 27]: And between every syllable , Charlotte gave Oliver a blow with all her might : accompanying it with a scream , for the benefit of society .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 50]: Charlotte 's fist was by no means a light one ; but , lest it should not be effectual in calming Oliver 's wrath , Mrs. Sowerberry plunged into the kitchen , and assisted to hold him with one hand , while she scratched his face with the other .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 18]: In this favourable position of affairs , Noah rose from the ground , and pommelled him behind .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 10]: This was rather too violent exercise to last long .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 37]: When they were all wearied out , and could tear and beat no longer , they dragged Oliver , struggling and shouting , but nothing daunted , into the dust-cellar , and there locked him up .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 16]: This being done , Mrs. Sowerberry sunk into a chair , and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 10]: ` Bless her , she 's going off ! '
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 4]: said Charlotte . '
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 9]: A glass of water , Noah , dear .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 4]: Make haste ! '
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 37]: Charlotte , ' said Mrs. Sowerberry : speaking as well as she could , through a deficiency of breath , and a sufficiency of cold water , which Noah had poured over her head and shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 16]: Charlotte , what a mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds ! '
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 10]: mercy indeed , ma'am , ' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 30]: I only hope this 'll teach master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures , that are born to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 3]: Poor Noah !
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 14]: He was all but killed , ma'am , when I come in . '
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 5]: ` Poor fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 10]: said Mrs. Sowerberry : looking piteously on the charity-boy .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 45]: Noah , whose top waistcoat-button might have been somewhere on a level with the crown of Oliver 's head , rubbed his eyes with the inside of his wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him , and performed some affecting tears and sniffs .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 8]: ` What 's to be done ! '
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 29]: ` Your master 's not at home ; there 's not a man in the house , and he 'll kick that door down in ten minutes . '
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 18]: Oliver 's vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in question , rendered this occurance highly probable .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 5]: ` Dear , dear !
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 20]: I do n't know , ma'am , ' said Charlotte , ` unless we send for the police-officers . '
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 10]: ` Or the millingtary , ' suggested Mr. Claypole .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 18]: ` No , no , ' said Mrs. Sowerberry : bethinking herself of Oliver 's old friend .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 28]: ` Run to Mr. Bumble , Noah , and tell him to come here directly , and not to lose a minute ; never mind your cap !
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 3]: Make haste !
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 15]: You can hold a knife to that black eye , as you run along .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 8]: It 'll keep the swelling down . '
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 51]: Noah stopped to make no reply , but started off at his fullest speed ; and very much it astonished the people who were out walking , to see a charity-boy tearing through the streets pell-mell , with no cap on his head , and a clasp-knife at his eye .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 29]: CHAPTER VII OLIVER CONTINUES REFRACTORY Noah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace , and paused not once for breath , until he reached the workhouse-gate .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 70]: Having rested here , for a minute or so , to collect a good burst of sobs and an imposing show of tears and terror , he knocked loudly at the wicket ; and presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it , that even he , who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of times , started back in astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 12]: ` Why , what 's the matter with the boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 5]: said the old pauper .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 4]: ` Mr. Bumble !
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 4]: Mr. Bumble ! '
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 93]: cried Noah , wit well-affected dismay : and in tones so loud and agitated , that they not only caught the ear of Mr. Bumble himself , who happened to be hard by , but alarmed him so much that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat , -- which is a very curious and remarkable circumstance : as showing that even a beadle , acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse , may be afflicted with a momentary visitation of loss of self-possession , and forgetfulness of personal dignity .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 9]: ` Oh , Mr. Bumble , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 16]: said Noah : ` Oliver , sir , -- Oliver has -- ' ` What ?
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 3]: What ? '
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 14]: interposed Mr. Bumble : with a gleam of pleasure in his metallic eyes .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 17]: ` Not run away ; he has n't run away , has he , Noah ? '
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 7]: ` No , sir , no .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 16]: Not run away , sir , but he 's turned wicious , ' replied Noah .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 21]: ` He tried to murder me , sir ; and then he tried to murder Charlotte ; and then missis .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 6]: what dreadful pain it is !
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 8]: Such agony , please , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 56]: And here , Noah writhed and twisted his body into an extensive variety of eel-like positions ; thereby giving Mr. Bumble to understand that , from the violent and sanguinary onset of Oliver Twist , he had sustained severe internal injury and damage , from which he was at that moment suffering the acutest torture .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 74]: When Noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed Mr. Bumble , he imparted additional effect thereunto , by bewailing his dreadful wounds ten times louder than before ; and when he observed a gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard , he was more tragic in his lamentations than ever : rightly conceiving it highly expedient to attract the notice , and rouse the indignation , of the gentleman aforesaid .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 58]: The gentleman 's notice was very soon attracted ; for he had not walked three paces , when he turned angrily round , and inquired what that young cur was howling for , and why Mr. Bumble did not favour him with something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so designated , an involuntary process ?
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 36]: ` It 's a poor boy from the free-school , sir , ' replied Mr. Bumble , ` who has been nearly murdered -- all but murdered , sir , -- by young Twist . '
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 5]: ` By Jove ! '
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 12]: exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat , stopping short . '
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 4]: I knew it !
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 22]: I felt a strange presentiment from the very first , that that audacious young savage would come to be hung ! '
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 26]: ` He has likewise attempted , sir , to murder the female servant , ' said Mr. Bumble , with a face of ashy paleness .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 10]: ` And his missis , ' interposed Mr. Claypole .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 15]: ` And his master , too , I think you said , Noah ? '
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 4]: added Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 3]: ` No !
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 15]: he 's out , or he would have murdered him , ' replied Noah .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 8]: ` He said he wanted to . '
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 12]: Said he wanted to , did he , my boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 8]: inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 9]: ` Yes , sir , ' replied Noah .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 33]: ` And please , sir , missis wants to know whether Mr. Bumble can spare time to step up there , directly , and flog him -- 'cause master 's out . '
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 36]: ` Certainly , my boy ; certainly , ' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat : smiling benignly , and patting Noah 's head , which was about three inches higher than his own .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 12]: ` You 're a good boy -- a very good boy .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 7]: Here 's a penny for you .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 21]: Bumble , just step up to Sowerberry 's with your cane , and seed what 's best to be done .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 8]: Do n't spare him , Bumble . '
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 14]: ` No , I will not , sir , ' replied the beadle .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 36]: And the cocked hat and cane having been , by this time , adjusted to their owner 's satisfaction , Mr. Bumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves with all speed to the undertaker 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 11]: Here the position of affairs had not at all improved .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 20]: Sowerberry had not yet returned , and Oliver continued to kick , with undiminished vigour , at the cellar-door .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 34]: The accounts of his ferocity as related by Mrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte , were of so startling a nature , that Mr. Bumble judged it prudent to parley , before opening the door .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 40]: With this view he gave a kick at the outside , by way of prelude ; and , then , applying his mouth to the keyhole , said , in a deep and impressive tone : ` Oliver ! '
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 9]: ` Come ; you let me out ! '
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 7]: replied Oliver , from the inside .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 11]: ` Do you know this here voice , Oliver ? '
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 4]: said Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' replied Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 10]: ` Ai n't you afraid of it , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 11]: Ai n't you a-trembling while I speak , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 4]: said Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 5]: replied Oliver , boldly .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 28]: An answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit , and was in the habit of receiving , staggered Mr. Bumble not a little .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 30]: He stepped back from the keyhole ; drew himself up to his full height ; and looked from one to another of the three bystanders , in mute astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 19]: ` Oh , you know , Mr. Bumble , he must be mad , ' said Mrs. Sowerberry .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 16]: ` No boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you . '
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 21]: ` It 's not Madness , ma'am , ' replied Mr. Bumble , after a few moments of deep meditation .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 6]: ` It 's Meat . '
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 4]: ` What ? '
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 15]: ` Meat , ma'am , meat , ' replied Bumble , with stern emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 8]: ` You 've over-fed him , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 35]: You 've raised a artificial soul and spirit in him , ma'am unbecoming a person of his condition : as the board , Mrs. Sowerberry , who are practical philosophers , will tell you .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 10]: What have paupers to do with soul or spirit ?
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 12]: It 's quite enough that we let 'em have live bodies .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 18]: If you had kept the boy on gruel , ma'am , this would never have happened . '
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 6]: ` Dear , dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 21]: ejaculated Mrs. Sowerberry , piously raising her eyes to the kitchen ceiling : ` this comes of being liberal ! '
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 50]: The liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver , had consisted of a profuse bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else would eat ; so there was a great deal of meekness and self-devotion in her voluntarily remaining under Mr. Bumble 's heavy accusation .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 21]: Of which , to do her justice , she was wholly innocent , in thought , word , or deed .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 68]: said Mr. Bumble , when the lady brought her eyes down to earth again ; ` the only thing that can be done now , that I know of , is to leave him in the cellar for a day or so , till he 's a little starved down ; and then to take him out , and keep him on gruel all through the apprenticeship .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 7]: He comes of a bad family .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 6]: Excitable natures , Mrs. Sowerberry !
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 33]: Both the nurse and doctor said , that that mother of his made her way here , against difficulties and pain that would have killed any well-disposed woman , weeks before . '
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 39]: At this point of Mr. Bumble 's discourse , Oliver , just hearing enough to know that some allusion was being made to his mother , recommenced kicking , with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 6]: Sowerberry returned at this juncture .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 42]: Oliver 's offence having been explained to him , with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best calculated to rouse his ire , he unlocked the cellar-door in a twinkling , and dragged his rebellious apprentice out , by the collar .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 28]: Oliver 's clothes had been torn in the beating he had received ; his face was bruised and scratched ; and his hair scattered over his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 30]: The angry flush had not disappeared , however ; and when he was pulled out of his prison , he scowled boldly on Noah , and looked quite undismayed .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 15]: ` Now , you are a nice young fellow , ai n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 15]: said Sowerberry ; giving Oliver a shake , and a box on the ear .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 11]: ` He called my mother names , ' replied Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 15]: ` Well , and what if he did , you little ungrateful wretch ? '
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 4]: said Mrs. Sowerberry .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 11]: ` She deserved what he said , and worse . '
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 8]: ` She did n't ' said Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 9]: ` She did , ' said Mrs. Sowerberry .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 7]: ` It 's a lie ! '
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 3]: said Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 9]: Mrs. Sowerberry burst into a flood of tears .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 10]: This flood of tears left Mr. Sowerberry no alternative .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 72]: If he had hesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely , it must be quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been , according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established , a brute , an unnatural husband , an insulting creature , a base imitation of a man , and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital within the limits of this chapter .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 46]: To do him justice , he was , as far as his power went -- it was not very extensive -- kindly disposed towards the boy ; perhaps , because it was his interest to be so ; perhaps , because his wife disliked him .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 43]: The flood of tears , however , left him no resource ; so he at once gave him a drubbing , which satisfied even Mrs. Sowerberry herself , and rendered Mr. Bumble 's subsequent application of the parochial cane , rather unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 78]: For the rest of the day , he was shut up in the back kitchen , in company with a pump and a slice of bread ; and at night , Mrs. Sowerberry , after making various remarks outside the door , by no means complimentary to the memory of his mother , looked into the room , and , amidst the jeers and pointings of Noah and Charlotte , ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 45]: It was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the gloomy workshop of the undertaker , that Oliver gave way to the feelings which the day 's treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a mere child .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 48]: He had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt ; he had borne the lash without a cry : for he felt that pride swelling in his heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last , though they had roasted him alive .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 58]: But now , when there were none to see or hear him , he fell upon his knees on the floor ; and , hiding his face in his hands , wept such tears as , God send for the credit of our nature , few so young may ever have cause to pour out before him !
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 12]: For a long time , Oliver remained motionless in this attitude .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 15]: The candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 23]: Having gazed cautiously round him , and listened intently , he gently undid the fastenings of the door , and looked abroad .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 8]: It was a cold , dark night .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 49]: The stars seemed , to the boy 's eyes , farther from the earth than he had ever seen them before ; there was no wind ; and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground , looked sepulchral and death-like , from being so still .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 6]: He softly reclosed the door .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 37]: Having availed himself of the expiring light of the candle to tie up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel he had , sat himself down upon a bench , to wait for morning .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 24]: With the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the shutters , Oliver arose , and again unbarred the door .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 26]: One timid look around -- one moment 's pause of hesitation -- he had closed it behind him , and was in the open street .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 15]: He looked to the right and to the left , uncertain whither to fly .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 18]: He remembered to have seen the waggons , as they went out , toiling up the hill .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 39]: He took the same route ; and arriving at a footpath across the fields : which he knew , after some distance , led out again into the road ; struck into it , and walked quickly on .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 26]: Along this same footpath , Oliver well-remembered he had trotted beside Mr. Bumble , when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 10]: His way lay directly in front of the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 19]: His heart beat quickly when he bethought himself of this ; and he half resolved to turn back .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 20]: He had come a long way though , and should lose a great deal of time by doing so .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 22]: Besides , it was so early that there was very little fear of his being seen ; so he walked on .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 5]: He reached the house .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 13]: There was no appearance of its inmates stirring at that early hour .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 9]: Oliver stopped , and peeped into the garden .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 30]: A child was weeding one of the little beds ; as he stopped , he raised his pale face and disclosed the features of one of his former companions .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 27]: Oliver felt glad to see him , before he went ; for , though younger than himself , he had been his little friend and playmate .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 19]: They had been beaten , and starved , and shut up together , many and many a time .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 6]: ` Hush , Dick ! '
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 23]: said Oliver , as the boy ran to the gate , and thrust his thin arm between the rails to greet him .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 7]: ` Is any one up ? '
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 10]: ` Nobody but me , ' replied the child .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 16]: ` You mus n't say you saw me , Dick , ' said Oliver . '
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 5]: I am running away .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 22]: They beat and ill-use me , Dick ; and I am going to seek my fortune , some long way off .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 6]: I do n't know where .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 7]: How pale you are ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 20]: I heard the doctor tell them I was dying , ' replied the child with a faint smile . '
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 20]: I am very glad to see you , dear ; but do n't stop , do n't stop ! '
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 21]: ` Yes , yes , I will , to say good-b ` ye to you , ' replied Oliver . '
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 8]: I shall see you again , Dick .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 5]: I know I shall !
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 9]: You will be well and happy ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 9]: I hope so , ' replied the child .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 10]: ` After I am dead , but not before .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 33]: I know the doctor must be right , Oliver , because I dream so much of Heaven , and Angels , and kind faces that I never see when I am awake .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 24]: Kiss me , ' said the child , climbing up the low gate , and flinging his little arms round Oliver 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 7]: ` Good-b ` ye , dear !
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 5]: God bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 48]: The blessing was from a young child 's lips , but it was the first that Oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head ; and through the struggles and sufferings , and troubles and changes , of his after life , he never once forgot it .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 7]: CHAPTER VIII OLIVER WALKS TO LONDON .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 28]: HE ENCOUNTERS ON THE ROAD A STRANGE SORT OF YOUNG GENTLEMAN Oliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated ; and once more gained the high-road .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 6]: It was eight o'clock now .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 35]: Though he was nearly five miles away from the town , he ran , and hid behind the hedges , by turns , till noon : fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 33]: Then he sat down to rest by the side of the milestone , and began to think , for the first time , where he had better go and try to live .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 28]: The stone by which he was seated , bore , in large characters , an intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to London .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 14]: The name awakened a new train of ideas in the boy 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 2]: London !
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 5]: -- that great place !
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 14]: -- nobody -- not even Mr. Bumble -- could ever find him there !
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 51]: He had often heard the old men in the workhouse , too , say that no lad of spirit need want in London ; and that there were ways of living in that vast city , which those who had been bred up in country parts had no idea of .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 22]: It was the very place for a homeless boy , who must die in the streets unless some one helped him .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 19]: As these things passed through his thoughts , he jumped upon his feet , and again walked forward .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 34]: He had diminished the distance between himself and London by full four miles more , before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could hope to reach his place of destination .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 24]: As this consideration forced itself upon him , he slackened his pace a little , and meditated upon his means of getting there .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 21]: He had a crust of bread , a coarse shirt , and two pairs of stockings , in his bundle .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 30]: He had a penny too -- a gift of Sowerberry 's after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more than ordinarily well -- in his pocket . '
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 45]: A clean shirt , ' thought Oliver , ` is a very comfortable thing ; and so are two pairs of darned stockings ; and so is a penny ; but they small helps to a sixty-five miles ' walk in winter time . '
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 67]: But Oliver 's thoughts , like those of most other people , although they were extremely ready and active to point out his difficulties , were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of surmounting them ; so , after a good deal of thinking to no particular purpose , he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder , and trudged on .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 37]: Oliver walked twenty miles that day ; and all that time tasted nothing but the crust of dry bread , and a few draughts of water , which he begged at the cottage-doors by the road-side .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 27]: When the night came , he turned into a meadow ; and , creeping close under a hay-rick , determined to lie there , till morning .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 33]: He felt frightened at first , for the wind moaned dismally over the empty fields : and he was cold and hungry , and more alone than he had ever felt before .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 18]: Being very tired with his walk , however , he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 39]: He felt cold and stiff , when he got up next morning , and so hungry that he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf , in the very first village through which he passed .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 15]: He had walked no more than twelve miles , when night closed in again .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 16]: His feet were sore , and his legs so weak that they trembled beneath him .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 28]: Another night passed in the bleak damp air , made him worse ; when he set forward on his journey next morning he could hardly crawl along .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 66]: He waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage-coach came up , and then begged of the outside passengers ; but there were very few who took any notice of him : and even those told him to wait till they got to the top of the hill , and then let them see how far he could run for a halfpenny .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 29]: Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way , but was unable to do it , by reason of his fatigue and sore feet .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 45]: When the outsides saw this , they put their halfpence back into their pockets again , declaring that he was an idle young dog , and did n't deserve anything ; and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust behind .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 28]: In some villages , large painted boards were fixed up : warning all persons who begged within the district , that they would be sent to jail .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 21]: This frightened Oliver very much , and made him glad to get out of those villages with all possible expedition .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 59]: In others , he would stand about the inn-yards , and look mournfully at every one who passed : a proceeding which generally terminated in the landlady 's ordering one of the post-boys who were lounging about , to drive that strange boy out of the place , for she was sure he had come to steal something .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 62]: If he begged at a farmer 's house , ten to one but they threatened to set the dog on him ; and when he showed his nose in a shop , they talked about the beadle -- which brought Oliver 's heart into his mouth , -- very often the only thing he had there , for many hours together .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 58]: In fact , if it had not been for a good-hearted turnpike-man , and a benevolent old lady , Oliver 's troubles would have been shortened by the very same process which had put an end to his mother 's ; in other words , he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king 's highway .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 84]: But the turnpike-man gave him a meal of bread and cheese ; and the old lady , who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part of the earth , took pity upon the poor orphan , and gave him what little she could afford -- and more -- with such kind and gently words , and such tears of sympathy and compassion , that they sank deeper into Oliver 's soul , than all the sufferings he had ever undergone .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 23]: Early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place , Oliver limped slowly into the little town of Barnet .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 22]: The window-shutters were closed ; the street was empty ; not a soul had awakened to the business of the day .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 41]: The sun was rising in all its splendid beauty ; but the light only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation , as he sat , with bleeding feet and covered with dust , upon a door-step .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 22]: By degrees , the shutters were opened ; the window-blinds were drawn up ; and people began passing to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 40]: Some few stopped to gaze at Oliver for a moment or two , or turned round to stare at him as they hurried by ; but none relieved him , or troubled themselves to inquire how he came there .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 7]: He had no heart to beg .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 5]: And there he sat .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 117]: He had been crouching on the step for some time : wondering at the great number of public-houses -LRB- every other house in Barnet was a tavern , large or small -RRB- , gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed through , and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do , with ease , in a few hours , what it had taken him a whole week of courage and determination beyond his years to accomplish : when he was roused by observing that a boy , who had passed him carelessly some minutes before , had returned , and was now surveying him most earnestly from the opposite side of the way .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 35]: He took little heed of this at first ; but the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long , that Oliver raised his head , and returned his steady look .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 22]: Upon this , the boy crossed over ; and walking close up to Oliver , said ` Hullo , my covey !
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 6]: What 's the row ? '
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 30]: The boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer , was about his own age : but one of the queerest looking boys that Oliver had even seen .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 37]: He was a snub-nosed , flat-browed , common-faced boy enough ; and as dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see ; but he had about him all the airs and manners of a man .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 19]: He was short of his age : with rather bow-legs , and little , sharp , ugly eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 61]: His hat was stuck on the top of his head so lightly , that it threatened to fall off every moment -- and would have done so , very often , if the wearer had not had a knack of every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch , which brought it back to its old place again .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 14]: He wore a man 's coat , which reached nearly to his heels .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 43]: He had turned the cuffs back , half-way up his arm , to get his hands out of the sleeves : apparently with the ultimated view of thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers ; for there he kept them .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 27]: He was , altogether , as roystering and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six , or something less , in the bluchers .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 6]: ` Hullo , my covey !
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 6]: What 's the row ? '
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 9]: said this strange young gentleman to Oliver . '
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 22]: I am very hungry and tired , ' replied Oliver : the tears standing in his eyes as he spoke . '
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 7]: I have walked a long way .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 9]: I have been walking these seven days . '
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 7]: ` Walking for sivin days ! '
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 5]: said the young gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 6]: ` Oh , I see .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 6]: Beak 's order , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 30]: But , ' he added , noticing Oliver 's look of surprise , ' I suppose you do n't know what a beak is , my flash com-pan-i-on . '
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 20]: Oliver mildly replied , that he had always heard a bird 's mouth described by the term in question .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 8]: ` My eyes , how green ! '
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 5]: exclaimed the young gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 39]: ` Why , a beak 's a madgst ` rate ; and when you walk by a beak 's order , it 's not straight forerd , but always agoing up , and niver a coming down agin .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 8]: Was you never on the mill ? '
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 5]: ` What mill ? '
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 3]: inquired Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 4]: ` What mill !
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 48]: Why , THE mill -- the mill as takes up so little room that it 'll work inside a Stone Jug ; and always goes better when the wind 's low with people , than when it 's high ; acos then they ca n't get workmen .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 20]: But come , ' said the young gentleman ; ` you want grub , and you shall have it .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 28]: I 'm at low-water-mark myself -- only one bob and a magpie ; but , as far as it goes , I 'll fork out and stump .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 7]: Up with you on your pins .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 3]: Now then !
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 3]: Morrice ! '
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 44]: Assisting Oliver to rise , the young gentleman took him to an adjacent chandler 's shop , where he purchased a sufficiency of ready-dressed ham and a half-quartern loaf , or , as he himself expressed it , ' a fourpenny bran ! '
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 35]: the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust , by the ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a portion of the crumb , and stuffing it therein .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 30]: Taking the bread under his arm , the young gentlman turned into a small public-house , and led the way to a tap-room in the rear of the premises .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 55]: Here , a pot of beer was brought in , by direction of the mysterious youth ; and Oliver , falling to , at his new friend 's bidding , made a long and hearty meal , during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time with great attention .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 6]: ` Going to London ? '
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 12]: said the strange boy , when Oliver had at length concluded .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 6]: ` Got any lodgings ? '
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 4]: ` Money ? '
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 24]: The strange boy whistled ; and put his arms into his pockets , as far as the big coat-sleeves would let them go .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 8]: ` Do you live in London ? '
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 3]: inquired Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 15]: I do , when I 'm at home , ' replied the boy . '
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 17]: I suppose you want some place to sleep in to-night , do n't you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 10]: I do , indeed , ' answered Oliver . '
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 14]: I have not slept under a roof since I left the country . '
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 11]: ` Do n't fret your eyelids on that score . '
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 5]: said the young gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 48]: ` I 've got to be in London to-night ; and I know a ` spectable old gentleman as lives there , wot 'll give you lodgings for nothink , and never ask for the change -- that is , if any genelman he knows interduces you .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 7]: And do n't he know me ?
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 4]: Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 5]: Not in the least !
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 4]: By no means .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 4]: Certainly not ! '
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 28]: The young gentelman smiled , as if to intimate that the latter fragments of discourse were playfully ironical ; and finished the beer as he did so .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 44]: This unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted ; especially as it was immediately followed up , by the assurance that the old gentleman referred to , would doubtless provide Oliver with a comfortable place , without loss of time .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 39]: This led to a more friendly and confidential dialogue ; from which Oliver discovered that his friend 's name was Jack Dawkins , and that he was a peculiar pet and protege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 92]: Mr. Dawkin 's appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the comforts which his patron 's interest obtained for those whom he took under his protection ; but , as he had a rather flightly and dissolute mode of conversing , and furthermore avowed that among his intimate friends he was better known by the sobriquet of ` The Artful Dodger , ' Oliver concluded that , being of a dissipated and careless turn , the moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 48]: Under this impression , he secretly resolved to cultivate the good opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible ; and , if he found the Dodger incorrigible , as he more than half suspected he should , to decline the honour of his farther acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 24]: As John Dawkins objected to their entering London before nightfall , it was nearly eleven o'clock when they reached the turnpike at Islington .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 89]: They crossed from the Angel into St. John 's Road ; struck down the small street which terminates at Sadler 's Wells Theatre ; through Exmouth Street and Coppice Row ; down the little court by the side of the workhouse ; across the classic ground which once bore the name of Hockley-in-the -- Hole ; thence into Little Saffron Hill ; and so into Saffron Hill the Great : along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace , directing Oliver to follow close at his heels .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 36]: Although Oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of his leader , he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either side of the way , as he passed along .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 11]: A dirtier or more wretched place he had never seen .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 17]: The street was very narrow and muddy , and the air was impregnated with filthy odours .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 45]: There were a good many small shops ; but the only stock in trade appeared to be heaps of children , who , even at that time of night , were crawling in and out at the doors , or screaming from the inside .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 35]: The sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the place , were the public-houses ; and in them , the lowest orders of Irish were wrangling with might and main .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 60]: Covered ways and yards , which here and there diverged from the main street , disclosed little knots of houses , where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth ; and from several of the door-ways , great ill-looking fellows were cautiously emerging , bound , to all appearance , on no very well-disposed or harmless errands .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 21]: Oliver was just considering whether he had n't better run away , when they reached the bottom of the hill .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 32]: His conductor , catching him by the arm , pushed open the door of a house near Field Lane ; and drawing him into the passage , closed it behind them .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 6]: ` Now , then ! '
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 15]: cried a voice from below , in reply to a whistle from the Dodger .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 6]: ` Plummy and slam ! '
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 4]: was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 54]: This seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right ; for the light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the passage ; and a man 's face peeped out , from where a balustrade of the old kitchen staircase had been broken away .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 26]: ` There 's two on you , ' said the man , thrusting the candle farther out , and shielding his eyes with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 11]: ` Who 's the t ` other one ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 13]: A new pal , ' replied Jack Dawkins , pulling Oliver forward .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 8]: ` Where did he come from ? '
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 3]: ` Greenland .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 5]: Is Fagin upstairs ? '
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 11]: ` Yes , he 's a sortin ' the wipes .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 5]: Up with you ! '
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 11]: The candle was drawn back , and the face disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 47]: Oliver , groping his way with one hand , and having the other firmly grasped by his companion , ascended with much difficulty the dark and broken stairs : which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition that showed he was well acquainted with them .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 16]: He threw open the door of a back-room , and drew Oliver in after him .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 15]: The walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and dirt .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 36]: There was a deal table before the fire : upon which were a candle , stuck in a ginger-beer bottle , two or three pewter pots , a loaf and butter , and a plate .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 60]: In a frying-pan , which was on the fire , and which was secured to the mantelshelf by a string , some sausages were cooking ; and standing over them , with a toasting-fork in his hand , was a very old shrivelled Jew , whose villainous-looking and repulsive face was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 39]: He was dressed in a greasy flannel gown , with his throat bare ; and seemed to be dividing his attention between the frying-pan and the clothes-horse , over which a great number of silk handkerchiefsl were hanging .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 17]: Several rough beds made of old sacks , were huddled side by side on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 31]: Seated round the table were four or five boys , none older than the Dodger , smoking long clay pipes , and drinking spirits with the air of middle-aged men .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 25]: These all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to the Jew ; and then turned round and grinned at Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 10]: So did the Jew himself , toasting-fork in hand .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 19]: ` This is him , Fagin , ' said Jack Dawkins ; ` my friend Oliver Twist . '
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 31]: The Jew grinned ; and , making a low obeisance to Oliver , took him by the hand , and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 32]: Upon this , the young gentleman with the pipes came round him , and shook both his hands very hard -- especially the one in which he held his little bundle .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 56]: One young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for him ; and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets , in order that , as he was very tired , he might not have the trouble of emptying them , himself , when he went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 32]: These civilities would probably be extended much farther , but for a liberal exercise of the Jew 's toasting-fork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate youths who offered them .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 18]: ` We are very glad to see you , Oliver , very , ' said the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 18]: ` Dodger , take off the sausages ; and draw a tub near the fire for Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 9]: Ah , you 're a-staring at the pocket-handkerchiefs !
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 5]: eh , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 12]: There are a good many of 'em , ai n't there ?
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 22]: We 've just looked 'em out , ready for the wash ; that 's all , Oliver ; that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 3]: ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 24]: The latter part of this speech , was hailed by a boisterous shout from all the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 10]: In the midst of which they went to supper .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 33]: Oliver ate his share , and the Jew then mixed him a glass of hot gin-and-water : telling him he must drink it off directly , because another gentleman wanted the tumbler .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 7]: Oliver did as he was desired .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 23]: Immediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the sacks ; and then he sunk into a deep sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 31]: CHAPTER IX CONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN , AND HIS HOPEFUL PUPILS It was late next morning when Oliver awoke , from a sound , long sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 42]: There was no other person in the room but the old Jew , who was boiling some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast , and whistling softly to himself as he stirred it round and round , with an iron spoon .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 36]: He would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below : and when he had satistified himself , he would go on whistling and stirring again , as before .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 14]: Although Oliver had roused himself from sleep , he was not thoroughly awake .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 56]: There is a drowsy state , between sleeping and waking , when you dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open , and yourself half conscious of everything that is passing around you , than you would in five nights with your eyes fast closed , and your senses wrapt in perfect unconsciousness .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 46]: At such time , a mortal knows just enough of what his mind is doing , to form some glimmering conception of its mighty powers , its bounding from earth and spurning time and space , when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 7]: Oliver was precisely in this condition .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 53]: He saw the Jew with his half-closed eyes ; heard his low whistling ; and recognised the sound of the spoon grating against the saucepan 's sides : and yet the self-same senses were mentally engaged , at the same time , in busy action with almost everybody he had ever known .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 15]: When the coffee was done , the Jew drew the saucepan to the hob .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 39]: Standing , then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes , as if he did not well know how to employ himself , he turned round and looked at Oliver , and called him by his name .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 12]: He did not answer , and was to all appearances asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 19]: After satisfiying himself upon this head , the Jew stepped gently to the door : which he fastened .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 30]: He then drew forth : as it seemed to Oliver , from some trap in the floor : a small box , which he placed carefully on the table .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 13]: His eyes glistened as he raised the lid , and looked in .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 25]: Dragging an old chair to the table , he sat down ; and took from it a magnificent gold watch , sparkling with jewels .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 4]: ` Aha ! '
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 18]: said the Jew , shrugging up his shoulders , and distorting every feature with a hideous grin .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 4]: ` Clever dogs !
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 3]: Clever dogs !
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 5]: Staunch to the last !
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 9]: Never told the old parson where they were .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 6]: Never poached upon old Fagin !
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 5]: And why should they ?
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 18]: It would n't have loosened the knot , or kept the drop up , a minute longer .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 6]: No , no , no !
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 3]: Fine fellows !
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 4]: Fine fellows ! '
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 25]: With these , and other muttered reflections of the like nature , the Jew once more deposited the watch in its place of safety .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 54]: At least half a dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box , and surveyed with equal pleasure ; besides rings , brooches , bracelet , and other articles of jewellery , of such magnificent materials , and costly workmanship , that Oliver had no idea , even of their names .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 23]: Having replaced these trinkets , the Jew took out another : so small that it lay in the palm of his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 36]: There seemed to be some very minute inscription on it ; for the Jew laid it flat upon the table , and shading it with his hand , pored over it , long and earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 32]: At length he put it down , as if despairing of success ; and , leaning back in his chair , muttered : ` What a fine thing capital punishment is !
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 14]: Dead men never repent ; dead men never bring awkward stories to light .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 11]: Ah , it 's a fine thing for the trade !
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 21]: Five of 'em strung up in a row , and none left to play booty , or turn white-livered ! '
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 74]: As the Jew uttered these words , his bright dark eyes , which had been staring vacantly before him , fell on Oliver 's face ; the boy 's eyes were fixed on his in mute curiousity ; and although the recognition was only for an instant -- for the briefest space of time that can possibly be conceived -- it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 31]: He closed the lid of the box with a loud crash ; and , laying his hand on a bread knife which was on the table , started furiously up .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 24]: He trembled very much though ; for , even in his terror , Oliver could see that the knife quivered in the air .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 6]: ` What 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 4]: said the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 8]: ` What do you watch me for ?
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 5]: Why are you awake ?
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 5]: What have you seen ?
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 5]: Speak out , boy !
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 4]: Quick -- quick !
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 5]: for your life . '
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 18]: I was n't able to sleep any longer , sir , ' replied Oliver , meekly . '
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 13]: I am very sorry if I have disturbed you , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 10]: ` You were not awake an hour ago ? '
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 10]: said the Jew , scowling fiercely on the boy .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 3]: ` No !
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 5]: No , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 3]: replied Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 6]: ` Are you sure ? '
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 17]: cried the Jew : with a still fiercer look than before : and a threatening attitude .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 17]: ` Upon my word I was not , sir , ' replied Oliver , earnestly . '
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 9]: I was not , indeed , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 9]: ` Tush , tush , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 41]: said the Jew , abruptly resuming his old manner , and playing with the knife a little , before he laid it down ; as if to induce the belief that he had caught it up , in mere sport .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 10]: ` Of course I know that , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 7]: I only tried to frighten you .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 6]: You 're a brave boy .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 9]: you 're a brave boy , Oliver . '
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 18]: The Jew rubbed his hands with a chuckle , but glanced uneasily at the box , notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 14]: ` Did you see any of these pretty things , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 14]: said the Jew , laying his hand upon it after a short pause .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 9]: ` Yes , sir , ' replied Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 8]: said the Jew , turning rather pale .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 13]: ` They -- they 're mine , Oliver ; my little property .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 12]: All I have to live upon , in my old age .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 10]: The folks call me a miser , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 9]: Only a miser ; that 's all . '
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 64]: Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in such a dirty place , with so many watches ; but , thinking that perhaps his fondness for the Dodger and the other boys , cost him a good deal of money , he only cast a deferential look at the Jew , and asked if he might get up .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 14]: ` Certainly , my dear , certainly , ' replied the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 3]: ` Stay .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 13]: There 's a pitcher of water in the corner by the door .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 19]: Bring it here ; and I 'll give you a basin to wash in , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 19]: Oliver got up ; walked across the room ; and stooped for an instant to raise the pitcher .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 11]: When he turned his head , the box was gone .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 62]: He had scarcely washed himself , and made everything tidy , by emptying the basin out of the window , agreeably to the Jew 's directions , when the Dodger returned : accompanied by a very sprightly young friend , whom Oliver had seen smoking on the previous night , and who was now formally introduced to him as Charley Bates .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 31]: The four sat down , to breakfast , on the coffee , and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought home in the crown of his hat .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 35]: ` Well , ' said the Jew , glancing slyly at Oliver , and addressing himself to the Dodger , ' I hope you 've been at work this morning , my dears ? '
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 8]: ` Hard , ' replied the Dodger .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 9]: ` As nails , ' added Charley Bates .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 8]: ` Good boys , good boys ! '
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 4]: said the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 10]: ` What have you got , Dodger ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 11]: A couple of pocket-books , ' replied that young gentlman .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 4]: ` Lined ? '
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 7]: inquired the Jew , with eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 21]: ` Pretty well , ' replied the Dodger , producing two pocket-books ; one green , and the other red .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 29]: ` Not so heavy as they might be , ' said the Jew , after looking at the insides carefully ; ` but very neat and nicely made .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 10]: Ingenious workman , ai n't he , Oliver ? '
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 10]: ` Very indeed , sir , ' said Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 29]: At which Mr. Charles Bates laughed uproariously ; very much to the amazement of Oliver , who saw nothing to laugh at , in anything that had passed .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 11]: ` And what have you got , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 6]: said Fagin to Charley Bates .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 16]: ` Wipes , ' replied Master Bates ; at the same time producing four pocket-handkerchiefs .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 21]: ` Well , ' said the Jew , inspecting them closely ; ` they 're very good ones , very .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 32]: You have n't marked them well , though , Charley ; so the marks shall be picked out with a needle , and we 'll teach Oliver how to do it .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 7]: Shall us , Oliver , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 3]: ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 11]: ` If you please , sir , ' said Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 24]: ` You 'd like to be able to make pocket-handkerchiefs as easy as Charley Bates , would n't you , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 4]: said the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 18]: ` Very much , indeed , if you 'll teach me , sir , ' replied Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 44]: Master Bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply , that he burst into another laugh ; which laugh , meeting the coffee he was drinking , and carrying it down some wrong channel , very nearly terminated in his premature suffocation .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 8]: ` He is so jolly green ! '
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 17]: said Charley when he recovered , as an apology to the company for his unpolite behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 57]: The Dodger said nothing , but he smoothed Oliver 's hair over his eyes , and said he 'd know better , by and by ; upon which the old gentleman , observing Oliver 's colour mounting , changed the subject by asking whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning ?
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 43]: This made him wonder more and more ; for it was plain from the replies of the two boys that they had both been there ; and Oliver naturally wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very industrious .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 31]: When the breakfast was cleared away ; the merry old gentlman and the two boys played at a very curious and uncommon game , which was performed in this way .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 92]: The merry old gentleman , placing a snuff-box in one pocket of his trousers , a note-case in the other , and a watch in his waistcoat pocket , with a guard-chain round his neck , and sticking a mock diamond pin in his shirt : buttoned his coat tight round him , and putting his spectacle-case and handkerchief in his pockets , trotted up and down the room with a stick , in imitation of the manner in which old gentlmen walk about the streets any hour in the day .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 26]: Sometimes he stopped at the fire-place , and sometimes at the door , making believe that he was staring with all his might into shop-windows .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 55]: At such times , he would look constantly round him , for fear of thieves , and would keep slapping all his pockets in turn , to see that he had n't lost anything , in such a very funny and natural manner , that Oliver laughed till the tears ran down his face .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 36]: All this time , the two boys followed him closely about : getting out of his sight , so nimbly , every time he turned round , that it was impossible to follow their motions .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 58]: At last , the Dodger trod upon his toes , or ran upon his boot accidently , while Charley Bates stumbled up against him behind ; and in that one moment they took from him , with the most extraordinary rapidity , snuff-box , note-case , watch-guard , chain , shirt-pin , pocket-handkerchief , even the spectacle-case .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 30]: If the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of his pockets , he cried out where it was ; and then the game began all over again .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 35]: When this game had been played a great many times , a couple of young ladies called to see the young gentleman ; one of whom was named Bet , and the other Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 25]: They wore a good deal of hair , not very neatly turned up behind , and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 27]: They were not exactly pretty , perhaps ; but they had a great deal of colour in their faces , and looked quite stout and hearty .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 17]: Being remarkably free and agreeable in their manners , Oliver thought them very nice girls indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 8]: As there is no doubt they were .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 7]: The visitors stopped a long time .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 31]: Spirits were produced , in consequence of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside ; and the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 17]: At length , Charley Bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 48]: This , it occurred to Oliver , must be French for going out ; for directly afterwards , the Dodger , and Charley , and the two young ladies , went away together , having been kindly furnished by the amiable old Jew with money to spend .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 10]: ` There , my dear , ' said Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 11]: ` That 's a pleasant life , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 9]: They have gone out for the day . '
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 9]: ` Have they done work , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 3]: inquired Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 43]: ` Yes , ' said the Jew ; ` that is , unless they should unexpectedly come across any , when they are out ; and they wo n't neglect it , if they do , my dear , depend upon it .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 8]: Make 'em your models , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 42]: Make 'em your models , ' tapping the fire-shovel on the hearth to add force to his words ; ` do everything they bid you , and take their advice in all matters -- especially the Dodger 's , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 22]: He 'll be a great man himself , and will make you one too , if you take pattern by him .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 14]: -- Is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 7]: said the Jew , stopping short .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 9]: ` Yes , sir , ' said Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 29]: ` See if you can take it out , without my feeling it ; as you saw them do , when we were at play this morning . '
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 33]: Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand , as he had seen the Dodger hold it , and drew the handkerchief lighty out of it with the other .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 6]: ` Is it gone ? '
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 4]: cried the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 17]: ` Here it is , sir , ' said Oliver , showing it in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 25]: ` You 're a clever boy , my dear , ' said the playful old gentleman , patting Oliver on the head approvingly . '
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 7]: I never saw a sharper lad .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 7]: Here 's a shilling for you .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 19]: If you go on , in this way , you 'll be the greatest man of the time .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 21]: And now come here , and I 'll show you how to take the marks out of the handkerchiefs . '
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 24]: Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman 's pocket in play , had to do with his chances of being a great man .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 35]: But , thinking that the Jew , being so much his senior , must know best , he followed him quietly to the table , and was soon deeply involved in his new study .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 22]: CHAPTER X OLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS NEW ASSOCIATES ; AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 67]: BEING A SHORT , BUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER , IN THIS HISTORY For many days , Oliver remained in the Jew 's room , picking the marks out of the pocket-handkerchief , -LRB- of which a great number were brought home , -RRB- and sometimes taking part in the game already described : which the two boys and the Jew played , regularly , every morning .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 34]: At length , he began to languish for fresh air , and took many occasions of earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work with his two companions .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 27]: Oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed , by what he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman 's character .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 47]: Whenever the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night , empty-handed , he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy habits ; and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life , by sending them supperless to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 35]: On one occasion , indeed , he even went so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs ; but this was carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 16]: At length , one morning , Oliver obtained the permission he had so eagerly sought .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 23]: There had been no handkerchiefs to work upon , for two or three days , and the dinners had been rather meagre .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 45]: Perhaps these were reasons for the old gentleman 's giving his assent ; but , whether they were or no , he told Oliver he might go , and placed him under the joint guardianship of Charley Bates , and his friend the Dodger .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 57]: The three boys sallied out ; the Dodger with his coat-sleeves tucked up , and his hat cocked , as usual ; Master Bates sauntering along with his hands in his pockets ; and Oliver between them , wondering where they were going , and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in , first .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 40]: The pace at which they went , was such a very lazy , ill-looking saunter , that Oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive the old gentleman , by not going to work at all .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 78]: The Dodger had a vicious propensity , too , of pulling the caps from the heads of small boys and tossing them down areas ; while Charley Bates exhibited some very loose notions concerning the rights of property , by pilfering divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides , and thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious , that they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 53]: These things looked so bad , that Oliver was on the point of declaring his intention of seeking his way back , in the best way he could ; when his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel , by a very mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 64]: They were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open square in Clerkenwell , which is yet called , by some strange perversion of terms , ` The Green ' : when the Dodger made a sudden stop ; and , laying his finger on his lip , drew his companions back again , with the greatest caution and circumspection .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 7]: ` What 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 3]: demanded Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 4]: replied the Dodger .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 12]: ` Do you see that old cove at the book-stall ? '
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 9]: ` The old gentleman over the way ? '
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 3]: said Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 8]: ` Yes , I see him . '
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 11]: ` He 'll do , ' said the Doger . '
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 10]: A prime plant , ' observed Master Charley Bates .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 48]: Oliver looked from one to the other , with the greatest surprise ; but he was not permitted to make any inquiries ; for the two boys walked stealthily across the road , and slunk close behind the old gentleman towards whom his attention had been directed .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 25]: Oliver walked a few paces after them ; and , not knowing whether to advance or retire , stood looking on in silent amazement .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 17]: The old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage , with a powdered head and gold spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 27]: He was dressed in a bottle-green coat with a black velvet collar ; wore white trousers ; and carried a smart bamboo cane under his arm .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 33]: He had taken up a book from the stall , and there he stood , reading away , as hard as if he were in his elbow-chair , in his own study .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 90]: It is very possible that he fancied himself there , indeed ; for it was plain , from his abstraction , that he saw not the book-stall , nor the street , nor the boys , nor , in short , anything but the book itself : which he was reading straight through : turning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page , beginning at the top line of the next one , and going regularly on , with the greatest interest and eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 50]: What was Oliver 's horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off , looking on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go , to see the Dodger plunge his hand into the old gentleman 's pocket , and draw from thence a handkerchief !
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 26]: To see him hand the same to Charley Bates ; and finally to behold them , both running away round the corner at full speed !
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 29]: In an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs , and the watches , and the jewels , and the Jew , rushed upon the boy 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 65]: He stood , for a moment , with the blood so tingling through all his veins from terror , that he felt as if he were in a burning fire ; then , confused and frightened , he took to his heels ; and , not knowing what he did , made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 10]: This was all done in a minute 's space .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 30]: In the very instant when Oliver began to run , the old gentleman , putting his hand to his pocket , and missing his handkerchief , turned sharp round .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 28]: Seeing the boy scudding away at such a rapid pace , he very naturally concluded him to be the depredator ; and shouting ` Stop thief ! '
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 14]: with all his might , made off after him , book in hand .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 14]: But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hue-and-cry .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 30]: The Dodger and Master Bates , unwilling to attract public attention by running down the open street , had merely retured into the very first doorway round the corner .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 36]: They no sooner heard the cry , and saw Oliver running , than , guessing exactly how the matter stood , they issued forth with great promptitude ; and , shouting ` Stop thief ! '
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 10]: too , joined in the pursuit like good citizens .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 27]: Although Oliver had been brought up by philosophers , he was not theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that self-preservation is the first law of nature .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 14]: If he had been , perhaps he would have been prepared for this .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 34]: Not being prepared , however , it alarmed him the more ; so away he went like the wind , with the old gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 4]: ` Stop thief !
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 4]: Stop thief ! '
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 8]: There is a magic in the sound .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 49]: The tradesman leaves his counter , and the car-man his waggon ; the butcher throws down his tray ; the baker his basket ; the milkman his pail ; the errand-boy his parcels ; the school-boy his marbles ; the paviour his pickaxe ; the child his battledore .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 49]: Away they run , pell-mell , helter-skelter , slap-dash : tearing , yelling , screaming , knocking down the passengers as they turn the corners , rousing up the dogs , and astonishing the fowls : and streets , squares , and courts , re-echo with the sound .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 4]: ` Stop thief !
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 4]: Stop thief ! '
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 18]: The cry is taken up by a hundred voices , and the crowd accumulate at every turning .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 66]: Away they fly , splashing through the mud , and rattling along the pavements : up go the windows , out run the people , onward bear the mob , a whole audience desert Punch in the very thickest of the plot , and , joining the rushing throng , swell the shout , and lend fresh vigour to the cry , ` Stop thief !
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 4]: Stop thief ! '
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 4]: ` Stop thief !
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 4]: Stop thief ! '
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 14]: There is a passion FOR HUNTING SOMETHING deeply implanted in the human breast .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 61]: One wretched breathless child , panting with exhaustion ; terror in his looks ; agaony in his eyes ; large drops of perspiration streaming down his face ; strains every nerve to make head upon his pursuers ; and as they follow on his track , and gain upon him every instant , they hail his decreasing strength with joy .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 5]: ` Stop thief ! '
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 15]: Ay , stop him for God 's sake , were it only in mercy !
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 4]: Stopped at last !
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 4]: A clever blow .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 30]: He is down upon the pavement ; and the crowd eagerly gather round him : each new comer , jostling and struggling with the others to catch a glimpse .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 5]: ` Stand aside ! '
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 8]: ` Give him a little air ! '
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 3]: ` Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 7]: he do n't deserve it . '
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 7]: ` Where 's the gentleman ? '
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 11]: ` Here his is , coming down the street . '
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 9]: ` Make room there for the gentleman ! '
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 9]: ` Is this the boy , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 46]: Oliver lay , covered with mud and dust , and bleeding from the mouth , looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him , when the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by the foremost of the pursuers .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 18]: ` Yes , ' said the gentleman , ' I am afraid it is the boy . '
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 4]: ` Afraid ! '
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 4]: murmured the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 9]: ` That 's a good ` un ! '
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 5]: ` Poor fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 12]: said the gentleman , ` he has hurt himself . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 28]: I did that , sir , ' said a great lubberly fellow , stepping forward ; ` and preciously I cut my knuckle agin ' his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 7]: I stopped him , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 95]: The follow touched his hat with a grin , expecting something for his pains ; but , the old gentleman , eyeing him with an expression of dislike , look anxiously round , as if he contemplated running away himself : which it is very possible he might have attempted to do , and thus have afforded another chase , had not a police officer -LRB- who is generally the last person to arrive in such cases -RRB- at that moment made his way through the crowd , and seized Oliver by the collar .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 13]: ` Come , get up , ' said the man , roughly .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 9]: ` It was n't me indeed , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 23]: Indeed , indeed , it was two other boys , ' said Oliver , clasping his hands passionately , and looking round .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 7]: ` They are here somewhere . '
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 13]: ` Oh no , they ai n't , ' said the officer .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 31]: He meant this to be ironical , but it was true besides ; for the Dodger and Charley Bates had filed off down the first convenient court they came to .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 7]: ` Come , get up ! '
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 14]: ` Do n't hurt him , ' said the old gentleman , compassionately .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 27]: ` Oh no , I wo n't hurt him , ' replied the officer , tearing his jacket half off his back , in proof thereof .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 12]: ` Come , I know you ; it wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 12]: Will you stand upon your legs , you young devil ? '
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 34]: Oliver , who could hardly stand , made a shift to raise himself on his feet , and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket-collar , at a rapid pace .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 39]: The gentleman walked on with them by the officer 's side ; and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat , got a little ahead , and stared back at Oliver from time to time .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 11]: The boys shouted in triumph ; and on they went .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 45]: CHAPTER XI TREATS OF MR. FANG THE POLICE MAGISTRATE ; AND FURNISHES A SLIGHT SPECIMEN OF HIS MODE OF ADMINISTERING JUSTICE The offence had been committed within the district , and indeed in the immediate neighborhood of , a very notorious metropolitan police office .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 50]: The crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying Oliver through two or three streets , and down a place called Mutton Hill , when he was led beneath a low archway , and up a dirty court , into this dispensary of summary justice , by the back way .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 36]: It was a small paved yard into which they turned ; and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of whiskers on his face , and a bunch of keys in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 8]: ` What 's the matter now ? '
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 6]: said the man carelessly . '
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 14]: A young fogle-hunter , ' replied the man who had Oliver in charge .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 13]: ` Are you the party that 's been robbed , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 7]: inquired the man with the keys .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 26]: ` Yes , I am , ' replied the old gentleman ; ` but I am not sure that this boy actually took the handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 11]: I -- I would rather not press the case . '
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 15]: ` Must go before the magistrate now , sir , ' replied the man .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 11]: ` His worship will be disengaged in half a minute .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 6]: Now , young gallows ! '
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 26]: This was an invitation for Oliver to enter through a door which he unlocked as he spoke , and which led into a stone cell .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 15]: Here he was searched ; and nothing being found upon him , locked up .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 18]: This cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar , only not so light .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 34]: It was most intolably dirty ; for it was Monday morning ; and it had been tenanted by six drunken people , who had been locked up , elsewhere , since Saturday night .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 5]: But this is little .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 55]: In our station-houses , men and women are every night confined on the most trivial charges -- the word is worth noting -- in dungeons , compared with which , those in Newgate , occupied by the most atrocious felons , tried , found guilty , and under sentence of death , are palaces .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 11]: Let any one who doubts this , compare the two .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 17]: The old gentleman looked almost as rueful as Oliver when the key grated in the lock .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 20]: He turned with a sigh to the book , which had been the innocent cause of all this disturbance .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 46]: ` There is something in that boy 's face , ' said the old gentleman to himself as he walked slowly away , tapping his chin with the cover of the book , in a thoughtful manner ; ` something that touches and interests me .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 5]: CAN he be innocent ?
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 30]: He looked like -- Bye the bye , ' exclaimed the old gentleman , halting very abruptly , and staring up into the sky , ` Bless my soul !
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 12]: -- where have I seen something like that look before ? '
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 57]: After musing for some minutes , the old gentleman walked , with the same meditative face , into a back anteroom opening from the yard ; and there , retiring into a corner , called up before his mind 's eye a vast amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many years .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 19]: ` No , ' said the old gentleman , shaking his head ; ` it must be imagination .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 6]: He wandered over them again .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 23]: He had called them into view , and it was not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 135]: There were the faces of friends , and foes , and of many that had been almost strangers peering intrusively from the crowd ; there were the faces of young and blooming girls that were now old women ; there were faces that the grave had changed and closed upon , but which the mind , superior to its power , still dressed in their old freshness and beauty , calling back the lustre of the eyes , the brightness of the smile , the beaming of the soul through its mask of clay , and whispering of beauty beyond the tomb , changed but to be heightened , and taken from earth only to be set up as a light , to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 18]: But the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which Oliver 's features bore a trace .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 35]: So , he heaved a sigh over the recollections he awakened ; and being , happily for himself , an absent old gentleman , buried them again in the pages of the musty book .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 26]: He was roused by a touch on the shoulder , and a request from the man with the keys to follow him into the office .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 21]: He closed his book hastily ; and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the renowned Mr. Fang .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 12]: The office was a front parlour , with a panelled wall .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 43]: Mr. Fang sat behind a bar , at the upper end ; and on one side the door was a sort of wooden pen in which poor little Oliver was already deposited ; trembling very much at the awfulness of the scene .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 35]: Mr. Fang was a lean , long-backed , stiff-necked , middle-sized man , with no great quantity of hair , and what he had , growing on the back and sides of his head .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 9]: His face was stern , and much flushed .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 36]: If he were really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good for him , he might have brought action against his countenance for libel , and have recovered heavy damages .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 33]: The old gentleman bowed respectfully ; and advancing to the magistrate 's desk , said suiting the action to the word , ` That is my name and address , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 25]: He then withdrew a pace or two ; and , with another polite and gentlemanly inclination of the head , waited to be questioned .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 59]: Now , it so happened that Mr. Fang was at that moment perusing a leading article in a newspaper of the morning , adverting to some recent decision of his , and commending him , for the three hundred and fiftieth time , to the special and particular notice of the Secretary of State for the Home Department .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 15]: He was out of temper ; and he looked up with an angry scowl .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 6]: ` Who are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 4]: said Mr. Fang .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 13]: The old gentleman pointed , with some surprise , to his card .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 4]: ` Officer ! '
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 13]: said Mr. Fang , tossing the card contemptuously away with the newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 7]: ` Who is this fellow ? '
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 26]: ` My name , sir , ' said the old gentleman , speaking LIKE a gentleman , ` my name , sir , is Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 29]: Permit me to inquire the name of the magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a respectable person , under the protection of the bench . '
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 24]: Saying this , Mr. Brownlow looked around the office as if in search of some person who would afford him the required information .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 4]: ` Officer ! '
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 20]: said Mr. Fang , throwing the paper on one side , ` what 's this fellow charged with ? '
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 16]: ` He 's not charged at all , your worship , ' replied the officer .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 11]: ` He appears against this boy , your worship . '
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 19]: His worshp knew this perfectly well ; but it was a good annoyance , and a safe one .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 10]: ` Appears against the boy , does he ? '
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 13]: said Mr. Fang , surveying Mr. Brownlow contemptuously from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 5]: ` Swear him ! '
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 46]: ` Before I am sworn , I must beg to say one word , ' said Mr. Brownlow ; ` and that is , that I really never , without actual experience , could have believed -- ' ` Hold your tongue , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 7]: said Mr. Fang , peremptorily . '
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 7]: I will not , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 5]: replied the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 19]: ` Hold your tongue this instant , or I 'll have you turned out of the office ! '
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 4]: said Mr. Fang .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 8]: ` You 're an insolent impertinent fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 8]: How dare you bully a magistrate ! '
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 4]: ` What ! '
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 7]: exclaimed the old gentleman , reddening .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 6]: ` Swear this person ! '
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 6]: said Fang to the clerk .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 8]: ` I 'll not hear another word .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 4]: Swear him . '
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 37]: Mr. Brownlow 's indignaton was greatly roused ; but reflecting perhaps , that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it , he suppressed his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 16]: ` Now , ' said Fang , ` what 's the charge against this boy ?
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 11]: What have you got to say , sir ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 12]: I was standing at a bookstall -- ' Mr. Brownlow began .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 12]: ` Hold your tongue , sir , ' said Mr. Fang .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 3]: ` Policeman !
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 5]: Where 's the policeman ?
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 6]: Here , swear this policeman .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 9]: Now , policeman , what is this ? '
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 38]: The policeman , with becoming humility , related how he had taken the charge ; how he had searched Oliver , and found nothing on his person ; and how that was all he knew about it .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 7]: ` Are there any witnesses ? '
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 4]: inquired Mr. Fang .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 11]: ` None , your worship , ' replied the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 23]: Mr. Fang sat silent for some minutes , and then , turning round to the prosecutor , said in a towering passion .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 21]: ` Do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is , man , or do you not ?
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 5]: You have been sworn .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 77]: Now , if you stand there , refusing to give evidence , I 'll punish you for disrespect to the bench ; I will , by -- ' By what , or by whom , nobody knows , for the clerk and jailor coughed very loud , just at the right moment ; and the former dropped a heavy book upon the floor , thus preventing the word from being heard -- accidently , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 78]: With many interruptions , and repeated insults , Mr. Brownlow contrived to state his case ; observing that , in the surprise of the moment , he had run after the boy because he had saw him running away ; and expressing his hope that , if the magistrate should believe him , although not actually the thief , to be connected with the thieves , he would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 15]: ` He has been hurt already , ' said the old gentleman in conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 28]: ` And I fear , ' he added , with great energy , looking towards the bar , ' I really fear that he is ill . '
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 7]: yes , I dare say ! '
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 8]: said Mr. Fang , with a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 18]: ` Come , none of your tricks here , you young vagabond ; they wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 6]: What 's your name ? '
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 10]: Oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 15]: He was deadly pale ; and the whole place seemed turning round and round .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 11]: ` What 's your name , you hardened scoundrel ? '
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 4]: demanded Mr. Fang .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 9]: ` Officer , what 's his name ? '
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 21]: This was addressed to a bluff old fellow , in a striped waistcoat , who was standing by the bar .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 48]: He bent over Oliver , and repeated the inquiry ; but finding him really incapable of understanding the question ; and knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the more , and add to the severity of his sentence ; he hazarded a guess .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 18]: ` He says his name 's Tom White , your worship , ' said the kind-hearted thief-taker .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 14]: ` Oh , he wo n't speak out , wo n't he ? '
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 3]: said Fang .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 7]: ` Very well , very well .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 6]: Where does he live ? '
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 21]: ` Where he can , your worship , ' replied the officer ; again pretending to receive Oliver 's answer .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 7]: ` Has he any parents ? '
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 4]: inquired Mr. Fang .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 22]: ` He says they died in his infancy , your worship , ' replied the officer : hazarding the usual reply .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 30]: At this point of the inquiry , Oliver raised his head ; and , looking round with imploring eyes , murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of water .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 6]: ` Stuff and nonsense ! '
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 17]: said Mr. Fang : ` do n't try to make a fool of me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 16]: I think he really is ill , your worship , ' remonstrated the officer . '
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 9]: I know better , ' said Mr. Fang .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 26]: ` Take care of him , officer , ' said the old gentleman , raising his hands instinctively ; ` he 'll fall down . '
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 19]: ` Stand away , officer , ' cried Fang ; ` let him , if he likes . '
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 18]: Oliver availed himself of the kind permission , and fell to the floor in a fainting fit .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 18]: The men in the office looked at each other , but no one dared to stir . '
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 20]: I knew he was shamming , ' said Fang , as if this were incontestable proof of the fact .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 15]: ` Let him lie there ; he 'll soon be tired of that . '
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 14]: ` How do you propose to deal with the case , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 8]: inquired the clerk in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 8]: ` Summarily , ' replied Mr. Fang .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 13]: ` He stands committed for three months -- hard labour of course .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 5]: Clear the office . '
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 54]: The door was opened for this purpose , and a couple of men were preparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell ; when an elderly man of decent but poor appearance , clad in an old suit of black , rushed hastily into the office , and advanced towards the bench .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 5]: ` Stop , stop !
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 6]: do n't take him away !
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 9]: For Heaven 's sake stop a moment ! '
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 9]: cried the new comer , breathless with haste .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 81]: Although the presiding Genii in such an office as this , exercise a summary and arbitrary power over the liberties , the good name , the character , almost the lives , of Her Majesty 's subjects , expecially of the poorer class ; and although , within such walls , enough fantastic tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping ; they are closed to the public , save through the medium of the daily press .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 10]: -LRB- Footnote : Or were virtually , then . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 19]: Mr. Fang was consequently not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such irreverent disorder .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 5]: ` What is this ?
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 4]: Who is this ?
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 5]: Turn this man out .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 5]: Clear the office ! '
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 5]: cried Mr. Fang . '
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 17]: I WILL speak , ' cried the man ; ' I will not be turned out .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 5]: I saw it all .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 5]: I keep the book-stall .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 6]: I demand to be sworn .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 7]: I will not be put down .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 8]: Mr. Fang , you must hear me .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 8]: You must not refuse , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 5]: The man was right .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 18]: His manner was determined ; and the matter was growing rather too serious to be hushed up .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 10]: ` Swear the man , ' growled Mr. Fang .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 6]: with a very ill grace .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 13]: ` Now , man , what have you got to say ? '
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 36]: ` This , ' said the man : ' I saw three boys : two others and the prisoner here : loitering on the opposite side of the way , when this gentleman was reading .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 8]: The robbery was committed by another boy .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 20]: I saw it done ; and I saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it . '
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 29]: Having by this time recovered a little breath , the worthy book-stall keeper proceeded to relate , in a more coherent manner the exact circumstances of the robbery .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 10]: ` Why did n't you come here before ? '
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 8]: said Fang , after a pause . '
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 15]: I had n't a soul to mind the shop , ' replied the man .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 14]: ` Everybody who could have helped me , had joined in the pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 19]: I could get nobody till five minutes ago ; and I 've run here all the way . '
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 10]: ` The prosecutor was reading , was he ? '
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 7]: inquired Fang , after another pause .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 8]: ` Yes , ' replied the man .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 11]: ` The very book he has in his hand . '
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 9]: ` Oh , that book , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 3]: said Fang .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 7]: ` Is it paid for ? '
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 16]: ` No , it is not , ' replied the man , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 11]: ` Dear me , I forgot all about it ! '
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 9]: exclaimed the absent old gentleman , innocently . '
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 13]: A nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 12]: said Fang , with a comical effort to look humane . '
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 38]: I consider , sir , that you have obtained possession of that book , under very suspicious and disreputable circumstances ; and you may think yourself very fortunate that the owner of the property declines to prosecute .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 19]: Let this be a lesson to you , my man , or the law will overtake you yet .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 5]: The boy is discharged .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 5]: Clear the office ! '
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 6]: 'D -- n me ! '
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 22]: cried the old gentleman , bursting out with the rage he had kept down so long , 'd -- n me !
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 10]: I 'll -- ' ` Clear the office ! '
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 4]: said the magistrate .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 7]: ` Officers , do you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 5]: Clear the office ! '
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 38]: The mandate was obeyed ; and the indignant Mr. Brownlow was conveyed out , with the book in one hand , and the bamboo cane in the other : in a perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 13]: He reached the yard ; and his passion vanished in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 38]: Little Oliver Twist lay on his back on the pavement , with his shirt unbuttoned , and his temples bathed with water ; his face a deadly white ; and a cold tremble convulsing his whole frame .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 8]: ` Poor boy , poor boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 8]: said Mr. Brownlow , bending over him .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 9]: ` Call a coach , somebody , pray .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 3]: Directly ! '
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 27]: A coach was obtained , and Oliver having been carefully laid on the seat , the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 7]: ` May I accompany you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 8]: said the book-stall keeper , looking in .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 17]: ` Bless me , yes , my dear sir , ' said Mr. Brownlow quickly . '
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 4]: I forgot you .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 4]: Dear , dear !
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 7]: I have this unhappy book still !
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 3]: Jump in .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 3]: Poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 8]: There 's no time to lose . '
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 13]: The book-stall keeper got into the coach ; and away they drove .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 16]: CHAPTER XII IN WHICH OLIVER IS TAKEN BETTER CARE OF THAN HE EVER WAS BEFORE .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 16]: AND IN WHICH THE NARRATIVE REVERTS TO THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS YOUTHFUL FRIENDS .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 57]: The coach rattled away , over nearly the same ground as that which Oliver had traversed when he first entered London in company with the Dodger ; and , turning a different way when it reached the Angel at Islington , stopped at length before a neat house , in a quiet shady street near Pentonville .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 41]: Here , a bed was prepared , without loss of time , in which Mr. Brownlow saw his young charge carefully and comfortably deposited ; and here , he was tended with a kindness and solicitude that knew no bounds .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 18]: But , for many days , Oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of his new friends .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 40]: The sun rose and sank , and rose and sank again , and many times after that ; and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy bed , dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 23]: The worm does not work more surely on the dead body , than does this slow creeping fire upon the living frame .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 24]: Weak , and thin , and pallid , he awoke at last from what seemed to have been a long and troubled dream .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 21]: Feebly raising himself in the bed , with his head resting on his trembling arm , he looked anxiously around .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 6]: ` What room is this ?
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 8]: Where have I been brought to ? '
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 3]: said Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 13]: ` This is not the place I went to sleep in . '
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 22]: He uttered these words in a feeble voice , being very faint and weak ; but they were overheard at once .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 45]: The curtain at the bed 's head was hastily drawn back , and a motherly old lady , very neatly and precisely dressed , rose as she undrew it , from an arm-chair close by , in which she had been sitting at needle-work .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 13]: ` Hush , my dear , ' said the old lady softly .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 32]: ` You must be very quiet , or you will be ill again ; and you have been very bad , -- as bad as bad could be , pretty nigh .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 10]: Lie down again ; there 's a dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 56]: With those words , the old lady very gently placed Oliver 's head upon the pillow ; and , smoothing back his hair from his forehead , looked so kindly and loving in his face , that he could not help placing his little withered hand in hers , and drawing it round his neck .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 5]: ` Save us ! '
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 11]: said the old lady , with tears in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 9]: ` What a grateful little dear it is .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 3]: Pretty creetur !
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 22]: What would his mother feel if she had sat by him as I have , and could see him now ! '
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 24]: ` Perhaps she does see me , ' whispered Oliver , folding his hands together ; ` perhaps she has sat by me .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 9]: I almost feel as if she had . '
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 17]: ` That was the fever , my dear , ' said the old lady mildly . '
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 36]: I suppose it was , ' replied Oliver , ` because heaven is a long way off ; and they are too happy there , to come down to the bedside of a poor boy .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 27]: But if she knew I was ill , she must have pitied me , even there ; for she was very ill herself before she died .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 18]: She ca n't know anything about me though , ' added Oliver after a moment 's silence .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 33]: ` If she had seen me hurt , it would have made here sorrowful ; and her face has always looked sweet and happy , when I have dreamed of her . '
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 71]: The old lady made no reply to this ; but wiping her eyes first , and her spectacles , which lay on the counterpane , afterwards , as if they were part and parcel of those features , brought some cool stuff for Oliver to drink ; and then , patting him on the cheek , told him he must lie very quiet , or he would be ill again .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 42]: So , Oliver kept very still ; partly because he was anxious to obey the kind old lady in all things ; and partly , to tell the truth , because he was completely exhausted with what he had already said .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 58]: He soon fell into a gentle doze , from which he was awakened by the light of a candle : which , being brought near the bed , showed him a gentleman with a very large and loud-ticking gold watch in his hand , who felt his pulse , and said he was a great deal better .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 16]: ` You ARE a great deal better , are you not , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 4]: said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 12]: ` Yes , thank you , sir , ' replied Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 24]: ` Yes , I know you are , ' said the gentleman : ` You 're hungry too , a n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 9]: ` No , sir , ' answered Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 4]: ` Hem ! '
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 4]: said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 9]: ` No , I know you 're not .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 17]: He is not hungry , Mrs. Bedwin , ' said the gentleman : looking very wise .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 26]: The old lady made a respectful inclination of the head , which seemed to say that she thought the doctor was a very clever man .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 10]: The doctor appeared much of the same opinion himself .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 13]: ` You feel sleepy , do n't you , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 4]: said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 9]: ` No , sir , ' replied Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 16]: ` No , ' said the doctor , with a very shrewd and satisfied look .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 6]: ` You 're not sleepy .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 3]: Nor thirsty .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 4]: Are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 12]: ` Yes , sir , rather thirsty , ' answered Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 14]: ` Just as I expected , Mrs. Bedwin , ' said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 11]: ` It 's very natural that he should be thirsty .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 18]: You may give him a little tea , ma'am , and some dry toast without any butter .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 29]: Do n't keep him too warm , ma'am ; but be careful that you do n't let him be too cold ; will you have the goodness ? '
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 7]: The old lady dropped a curtsey .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 35]: The doctor , after tasting the cool stuff , and expressing a qualified approval of it , hurried away : his boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he went downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 19]: Oliver dozed off again , soon after this ; when he awoke , it was nearly twelve o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 43]: The old lady tenderly bade him good-night shortly afterwards , and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just come : bringing with her , in a little bundle , a small Prayer Book and a large nightcap .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 62]: Putting the latter on her head and the former on the table , the old woman , after telling Oliver that she had come to sit up with him , drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series of short naps , chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings forward , and divers moans and chokings .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 24]: These , however , had no worse effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard , and then fall asleep again .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 8]: And thus the night crept slowly on .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 40]: Oliver lay awake for some time , counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the rushlight-shade threw upon the ceiling ; or tracing with his languid eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 65]: The darkness and the deep stillness of the room were very solemn ; as they brought into the boy 's mind the thought that death had been hovering there , for many days and nights , and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his awful presence , he turned his face upon the pillow , and fervently prayed to Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 30]: Gradually , he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent suffering alone imparts ; that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain to wake from .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 45]: Who , if this were death , would be roused again to all the struggles and turmoils of life ; to all its cares for the present ; its anxieties for the future ; more than all , its weary recollections of the past !
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 21]: It had been bright day , for hours , when Oliver opened his eyes ; he felt cheerful and happy .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 9]: The crisis of the disease was safely past .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 7]: He belonged to the world again .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 49]: In three days ' time he was able to sit in an easy-chair , well propped up with pillows ; and , as he was still too weak to walk , Mrs. Bedwin had him carried downstairs into the little housekeeper 's room , which belonged to her .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 42]: Having him set , here , by the fire-side , the good old lady sat herself down too ; and , being in a state of considerable delight at seeing him so much better , forthwith began to cry most violently .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 24]: ` Never mind me , my dear , ' said the old lady ; ` I 'm only having a regular good cry .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 15]: There ; it 's all over now ; and I 'm quite comfortable . '
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 16]: ` You 're very , very kind to me , ma'am , ' said Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 75]: ` Well , never you mind that , my dear , ' said the old lady ; ` that 's got nothing to do with your broth ; and it 's full time you had it ; for the doctor says Mr. Brownlow may come in to see you this morning ; and we must get up our best looks , because the better we look , the more he 'll be pleased . '
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 55]: And with this , the old lady applied herself to warming up , in a little saucepan , a basin full of broth : strong enough , Oliver thought , to furnish an ample dinner , when reduced to the regulation strength , for three hundred and fifty paupers , at the lowest computation .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 10]: ` Are you fond of pictures , dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 31]: inquired the old lady , seeing that Oliver had fixed his eyes , most intently , on a portrait which hung against the wall ; just opposite his chair . '
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 31]: I do n't quite know , ma'am , ' said Oliver , without taking his eyes from the canvas ; ' I have seen so few that I hardly know .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 12]: What a beautiful , mild face that lady 's is ! '
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 26]: said the old lady , ` painters always make ladies out prettier than they are , or they would n't get any custom , child .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 24]: The man that invented the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never succeed ; it 's a deal too honest .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 17]: A deal , ' said the old lady , laughing very heartily at her own acuteness .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 11]: ` Is -- is that a likeness , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 3]: said Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 25]: ` Yes , ' said the old lady , looking up for a moment from the broth ; ` that 's a portrait . '
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 6]: ` Whose , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 3]: asked Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 23]: ` Why , really , my dear , I do n't know , ' answered the old lady in a good-humoured manner .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 17]: ` It 's not a likeness of anybody that you or I know , I expect .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 10]: It seems to strike your fancy , dear . '
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 10]: ` It is so pretty , ' replied Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 12]: ` Why , sure you 're not afraid of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 22]: said the old lady : observing in great surprise , the look of awe with which the child regarded the painting .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 30]: ` Oh no , no , ' returned Oliver quickly ; ` but the eyes look so sorrowful ; and where I sit , they seem fixed upon me .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 33]: It makes my heart beat , ' added Oliver in a low voice , ` as if it was alive , and wanted to speak to me , but could n't . '
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 6]: ` Lord save us ! '
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 17]: exclaimed the old lady , starting ; ` do n't talk in that way , child .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 9]: You 're weak and nervous after your illness .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 19]: Let me wheel your chair round to the other side ; and then you wo n't see it .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 3]: There ! '
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 25]: said the old lady , suiting the action to the word ; ` you do n't see it now , at all events . '
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 75]: Oliver DID see it in his mind 's eye as distinctly as if he had not altered his position ; but he thought it better not to worry the kind old lady ; so he smiled gently when she looked at him ; and Mrs. Bedwin , satisfied that he felt more comfortable , salted and broke bits of toasted bread into the broth , with all the bustle befitting so solemn a preparation .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 8]: Oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 18]: He had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful , when there came a soft rap at the door .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 16]: ` Come in , ' said the old lady ; and in walked Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 57]: Now , the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be ; but , he had no sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead , and thrust his hands behind the skirts of his dressing-gown to take a good long look at Oliver , than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd contortions .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 94]: Oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness , and made an ineffectual attempt to stand up , out of respect to his benefactor , which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again ; and the fact is , if the truth must be told , that Mr. Brownlow 's heart , being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane disposition , forced a supply of tears into his eyes , by some hydraulic process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a condition to explain .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 8]: ` Poor boy , poor boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 8]: said Mr. Brownlow , clearing his throat .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 11]: ` I 'm rather hoarse this morning , Mrs. Bedwin .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 10]: I 'm afraid I have caught cold . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 11]: I hope not , sir , ' said Mrs. Bedwin .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 15]: ` Everything you have had , has been well aired , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 7]: I do n't know , Bedwin .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 28]: I do n't know , ' said Mr. Brownlow ; ' I rather think I had a damp napkin at dinner-time yesterday ; but never mind that .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 9]: How do you feel , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 10]: ` Very happy , sir , ' replied Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 15]: ` And very grateful indeed , sir , for your goodness to me . '
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 11]: ` Good by , ' said Mr. Brownlow , stoutly .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 10]: ` Have you given him any nourishment , Bedwin ?
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 6]: Any slops , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 52]: ` He has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth , sir , ' replied Mrs. Bedwin : drawing herself up slightly , and laying strong emphasis on the last word : to intimate that between slops , and broth will compounded , there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 4]: ` Ugh ! '
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 27]: said Mr. Brownlow , with a slight shudder ; ' a couple of glasses of port wine would have done him a great deal more good .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 10]: Would n't they , Tom White , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 21]: ` My name is Oliver , sir , ' replied the little invalid : with a look of great astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 12]: ` Oliver , ' said Mr. Brownlow ; ` Oliver what ?
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 6]: Oliver White , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 11]: ` No , sir , Twist , Oliver Twist . '
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 5]: ` Queer name ! '
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 5]: said the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 14]: ` What made you tell the magistrate your name was White ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 14]: I never told him so , sir , ' returned Oliver in amazement .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 19]: This sounded so like a falsehood , that the old gentleman looked somewhat sternly in Oliver 's face .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 20]: It was impossible to doubt him ; there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 9]: ` Some mistake , ' said Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 42]: But , although his motive for looking steadily at Oliver no longer existed , the old idea of the resemblance between his features and some familiar face came upon him so strongly , that he could not withdraw his gaze . '
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 12]: I hope you are not angry with me , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 8]: said Oliver , raising his eyes beseechingly .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 11]: ` No , no , ' replied the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 3]: ` Why !
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 4]: what 's this ?
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 6]: Bedwin , look there ! '
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 23]: As he spoke , he pointed hastily to the picture over Oliver 's head , and then to the boy 's face .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 6]: There was its living copy .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 15]: The eyes , the head , the mouth ; every feature was the same .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 22]: The expression was , for the instant , so precisely alike , that the minutest line seemed copied with startling accuracy !
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 28]: Oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation ; for , not being strong enough to bear the start it gave him , he fainted away .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 248]: A weakness on his part , which affords the narrative an opportunity of relieving the reader from suspense , in behalf of the two young pupils of the Merry Old Gentleman ; and of recording -- That when the Dodger , and his accomplished friend Master Bates , joined in the hue-and-cry which was raised at Oliver 's heels , in consequence of their executing an illegal conveyance of Mr. Brownlow 's personal property , as has been already described , they were actuated by a very laudable and becoming regard for themselves ; and forasmuch as the freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the first and proudest boasts of a true-hearted Englishman , so , I need hardly beg the reader to observe , that this action should tend to exalt them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men , in almost as great a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code of laws which certain profound and sound-judging philosophers have laid down as the main-springs of all Nature 's deeds and actions : the said philosophers very wisely reducing the good lady 's proceedings to matters of maxim and theory : and , by a very neat and pretty compliment to her exalted wisdom and understanding , putting entirely out of sight any considerations of heart , or generous impulse and feeling .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 29]: For , these are matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and weaknesses of her sex .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 72]: If I wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate predicament , I should at once find it in the fact -LRB- also recorded in a foregoing part of this narrative -RRB- , of their quitting the pursuit , when the general attention was fixed upon Oliver ; and making immediately for their home by the shortest possible cut .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 122]: Although I do not mean to assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages , to shorten the road to any great conclusion -LRB- their course indeed being rather to lengthen the distance , by various circumlocations and discursive staggerings , like unto those in which drunken men under the pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas , are prone to indulge -RRB- ; still , I do mean to say , and do say distinctly , that it is the invariable practice of many mighty philosophers , in carrying out their theories , to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 80]: Thus , to do a great right , you may do a little wrong ; and you may take any means which the end to be attained , will justify ; the amount of the right , or the amount of the wrong , or indeed the distinction between the two , being left entirely to the philosopher concerned , to be settled and determined by his clear , comprehensive , and impartial view of his own particular case .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 37]: It was not until the two boys had scoured , with great rapidity , through a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts , that they ventured to halt beneath a low and dark archway .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 49]: Having remained silent here , just long enough to recover breath to speak , Master Bates uttered an exclamation of amusement and delight ; and , bursting into an uncontrollable fit of laughter , flung himself upon a doorstep , and rolled thereon in a transport of mirth .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 7]: ` What 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 4]: inquired the Dodger .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 3]: ` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 3]: ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 4]: roared Charley Bates .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 14]: ` Hold your noise , ' remonstrated the Dodger , looking cautiously round .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 12]: ` Do you want to be grabbed , stupid ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 17]: I ca n't help it , ' said Charley , ' I ca n't help it !
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 59]: To see him splitting away at that pace , and cutting round the corners , and knocking up again ' the posts , and starting on again as if he was made of iron as well as them , and me with the wipe in my pocket , singing out arter him -- oh , my eye ! '
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 16]: The vivid imagination of Master Bates presented the scene before him in too strong colours .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 20]: As he arrived at this apostrophe , he again rolled upon the door-step , and laughed louder than before .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 7]: ` What 'll Fagin say ? '
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 23]: inquired the Dodger ; taking advantage of the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the question .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 4]: ` What ? '
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 4]: repeated Charley Bates .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 6]: ` Ah , what ? '
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 4]: said the Dodger .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 9]: ` Why , what should he say ? '
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 18]: inquired Charley : stopping rather suddenly in his merriment ; for the Dodger 's manner was impressive .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 7]: ` What should he say ? '
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 24]: Mr. Dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes ; then , taking off his hat , scratched his head , and nodded thrice .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 3]: said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 34]: ` Toor rul lol loo , gammon and spinnage , the frog he would n't , and high cockolorum , ' said the Dodger : with a slight sneer on his intellectual countenance .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 8]: This was explanatory , but not satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 17]: Master Bates felt it so ; and again said , ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 59]: The Dodger made no reply ; but putting his hat on again , and gathering the skirts of his long-tailed coat under his arm , thrust his tongue into his cheek , slapped the bridge of his nose some half-dozen times in a familiar but expressive manner , and turning on his heel , slunk down the court .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 9]: Master Bates followed , with a thoughtful countenance .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 55]: The noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs , a few minutes after the occurrence of this conversation , roused the merry old gentleman as he sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand ; a pocket-knife in his right ; and a pewter pot on the trivet .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 35]: There was a rascally smile on his white face as he turned round , and looking sharply out from under his thick red eyebrows , bent his ear towards the door , and listened .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 8]: ` Why , how 's this ? '
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 13]: muttered the Jew : changing countenance ; ` only two of 'em ?
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 5]: Where 's the third ?
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 8]: They ca n't have got into trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 3]: Hark ! '
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 10]: The footsteps approached nearer ; they reached the landing .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 19]: The door was slowly opened ; and the Dodger and Charley Bates entered , closing it behind them .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 31]: CHAPTER XIII SOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES ARE INTRODUCED TO THE INTELLIGENT READER , CONNECTED WITH WHOM VARIOUS PLEASANT MATTERS ARE RELATED , APPERTAINING TO THIS HISTORY ` Where 's Oliver ? '
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 10]: said the Jew , rising with a menacing look .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 7]: ` Where 's the boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 22]: The young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his violence ; and looked uneasily at each other .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 6]: But they made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 9]: ` What 's become of the boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 19]: said the Jew , seizing the Dodger tightly by the collar , and threatening him with horrid imprecations .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 11]: ` Speak out , or I 'll throttle you ! '
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 72]: Mr. Fagin looked so very much in earnest , that Charley Bates , who deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side , and who conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be throttled second , dropped upon his knees , and raised a loud , well-sustained , and continuous roar -- something between a mad bull and a speaking trumpet .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 6]: ` Will you speak ? '
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 23]: thundered the Jew : shaking the Dodger so much that his keeping in the big coat at all , seemed perfectly miraculous .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 23]: ` Why , the traps have got him , and that 's all about it , ' said the Dodger , sullenly .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 13]: ` Come , let go o ' me , will you ! '
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 69]: And , swinging himself , at one jerk , clean out of the big coat , which he left in the Jew 's hands , the Dodger snatched up the toasting fork , and made a pass at the merry old gentleman 's waistcoat ; which , if it had taken effect , would have let a little more merriment out , than could have been easily replaced .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 41]: The Jew stepped back in this emergency , with more agility than could have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude ; and , seizing up the pot , prepared to hurl it at his assailant 's head .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 32]: But Charley Bates , at this moment , calling his attention by a perfectly terrific howl , he suddenly altered its destination , and flung it full at that young gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 13]: ` Why , what the blazes is in the wind now ! '
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 5]: growled a deep voice .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 9]: ` Who pitched that ` ere at me ?
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 24]: It 's well it 's the beer , and not the pot , as hit me , or I 'd have settled somebody .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 42]: I might have know 'd , as nobody but an infernal , rich , plundering , thundering old Jew could afford to throw away any drink but water -- and not that , unless he done the River Company every quarter .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 8]: Wot 's it all about , Fagin ?
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 13]: D -- me , if my neck-handkercher a n't lined with beer !
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 23]: Come in , you sneaking warmint ; wot are you stopping outside for , as if you was ashamed of your master !
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 4]: Come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 76]: The man who growled out these words , was a stoutly-built fellow of about five-and-thirty , in a black velveteen coat , very soiled drab breeches , lace-up half boots , and grey cotton stockings which inclosed a bulky pair of legs , with large swelling calves ; -- the kind of legs , which in such costume , always look in an unfinished and incomplete state without a set of fetters to garnish them .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 36]: He had a brown hat on his head , and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck : with the long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 43]: He disclosed , when he had done so , a broad heavy countenance with a beard of three days ' growth , and two scowling eyes ; one of which displayed various parti-coloured symptoms of having been recently damaged by a blow .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 8]: ` Come in , d'ye hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 5]: growled this engaging ruffian .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 21]: A white shaggy dog , with his face scratched and torn in twenty different places , skulked into the room .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 10]: ` Why did n't you come in afore ? '
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 4]: said the man .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 15]: ` You 're getting too proud to own me afore company , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 4]: Lie down ! '
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 20]: This command was accompanied with a kick , which sent the animal to the other end of the room .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 49]: He appeared well used to it , however ; for he coiled himself up in a corner very quietly , without uttering a sound , and winking his very ill-looking eyes twenty times in a minute , appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 7]: ` What are you up to ?
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 14]: Ill-treating the boys , you covetous , avaricious , in-sa-ti-a-ble old fence ? '
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 9]: said the man , seating himself deliberately . '
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 8]: I wonder they do n't murder you !
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 7]: I would if I was them .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 59]: If I 'd been your ` prentice , I 'd have done it long ago , and -- no , I could n't have sold you afterwards , for you 're fit for nothing but keeping as a curiousity of ugliness in a glass bottle , and I suppose they do n't blow glass bottles large enough . '
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 3]: ` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 2]: hush !
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 18]: Mr. Sikes , ' said the Jew , trembling ; ` do n't speak so loud ! '
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 21]: ` None of your mistering , ' replied the ruffian ; ` you always mean mischief when you come that .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 9]: You know my name : out with it !
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 11]: I sha n't disgrace it when the time comes . '
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 19]: ` Well , well , then -- Bill Sikes , ' said the Jew , with abject humility .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 10]: ` You seem out of humour , Bill . '
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 49]: ` Perhaps I am , ' replied Sikes ; ' I should think you was rather out of sorts too , unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots about , as you do when you blab and -- ' ` Are you mad ? '
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 17]: said the Jew , catching the man by the sleeve , and pointing towards the boys .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 37]: Mr. Sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left ear , and jerking his head over on the right shoulder ; a piece of dumb show which the Jew appeared to understand perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 34]: He then , in cant terms , with which his whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled , but which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here , demanded a glass of liquor .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 21]: ` And mind you do n't poison it , ' said Mr. Sikes , laying his hat upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 68]: This was said in jest ; but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer with which the Jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard , he might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary , or the wish -LRB- at all events -RRB- to improve upon the distiller 's ingenuity not very far from the old gentleman 's merry heart .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 63]: After swallowing two of three glasses of spirits , Mr. Sikes condescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen ; which gracious act led to a conversation , in which the cause and manner of Oliver 's capture were circumstantially detailed , with such alterations and improvements on the truth , as to the Dodger appeared most advisable under the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 24]: ` I 'm afraid , ' said the Jew , ` that he may say something which will get us into trouble . '
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 14]: ` That 's very likely , ' returned Sikes with a malicious grin .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 9]: ` You 're blowed upon , Fagin . '
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 78]: ` And I 'm afraid , you see , added the Jew , speaking as if he had not noticed the interruption ; and regarding the other closely as he did so , -- ` I 'm afraid that , if the game was up with us , it might be up with a good many more , and that it would come out rather worse for you than it would for me , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 11]: The man started , and turned round upon the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 24]: But the old gentleman 's shoulders were shrugged up to his ears ; and his eyes were vacantly staring on the opposite wall .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 6]: There was a long pause .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 53]: Every member of the respectable coterie appeared plunged in his own reflections ; not excepting the dog , who by a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter in the streets when he went out .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 31]: ` Somebody must find out wot 's been done at the office , ' said Mr. Sikes in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 5]: The Jew nodded assent .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 36]: ` If he has n't peached , and is committed , there 's no fear till he comes out again , ' said Mr. Sikes , ` and then he must be taken care on .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 9]: You must get hold of him somehow . '
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 5]: Again the Jew nodded .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 28]: The prudence of this line of action , indeed , was obvious ; but , unfortunately , there was one very strong objection to its being adopted .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 44]: This was , that the Dodger , and Charley Bates , and Fagin , and Mr. William Sikes , happened , one and all , to entertain a violent and deeply-rooted antipathy to going near a police-office on any ground or pretext whatever .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 31]: How long they might have sat and looked at each other , in a state of uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind , it is difficult to guess .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 39]: It is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject , however ; for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom Oliver had seen on a former occasion , caused the conversation to flow afresh .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 6]: ` The very thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 4]: said the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 13]: ` Bet will go ; wo n't you , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 4]: ` Wheres ? '
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 5]: inquired the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 17]: ` Only just up to the office , my dear , ' said the Jew coaxingly .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 81]: It is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm that she would not , but that she merely expressed an emphatic and earnest desire to be ` blessed ' if she would ; a polite and delicate evasion of the request , which shows the young lady to have been possessed of that natural good breeding which can not bear to inflict upon a fellow-creature , the pain of a direct and pointed refusal .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 6]: The Jew 's countenance fell .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 34]: He turned from this young lady , who was gaily , not to say gorgeously attired , in a red gown , green boots , and yellow curl-papers , to the other female .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 22]: ` Nancy , my dear , ' said the Jew in a soothing manner , ` what do YOU say ? '
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 22]: ` That it wo n't do ; so it 's no use a-trying it on , Fagin , ' replied Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 9]: ` What do you mean by that ? '
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 11]: said Mr. Sikes , looking up in a surly manner .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 13]: ` What I say , Bill , ' replied the lady collectedly .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 27]: ` Why , you 're just the very person for it , ' reasoned Mr. Sikes : ` nobody about here knows anything of you . '
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 35]: ` And as I do n't want 'em to , neither , ' replied Nancy in the same composed manner , ` it 's rather more no than yes with me , Bill . '
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 11]: ` She 'll go , Fagin , ' said Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 13]: ` No , she wo n't , Fagin , ' said Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 12]: ` Yes , she will , Fagin , ' said Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 6]: And Mr. Sikes was right .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 24]: By dint of alternate threats , promises , and bribes , the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake the commission .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 53]: She was not , indeed , withheld by the same considerations as her agreeable friend ; for , having recently removed into the neighborhood of Field Lane from the remote but genteel suburb of Ratcliffe , she was not under the same apprehension of being recognised by any of her numerous acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 47]: Accordingly , with a clean white apron tied over her gown , and her curl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet , -- both articles of dress being provided from the Jew 's inexhaustible stock , -- Miss Nancy prepared to issue forth on her errand .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 20]: ` Stop a minute , my dear , ' said the Jew , producing , a little covered basket .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 7]: ` Carry that in one hand .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 9]: It looks more respectable , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 29]: ` Give her a door-key to carry in her t ` other one , Fagin , ' said Sikes ; ` it looks real and genivine like . '
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 33]: ` Yes , yes , my dear , so it does , ' said the Jew , hanging a large street-door key on the forefinger of the young lady 's right hand .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 6]: ` There ; very good !
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 8]: Very good indeed , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 8]: said the Jew , rubbing his hands .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 6]: ` Oh , my brother !
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 12]: My poor , dear , sweet , innocent little brother ! '
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 22]: exclaimed Nancy , bursting into tears , and wringing the little basket and the street-door key in an agony of distress .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 7]: ` What has become of him !
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 7]: Where have they taken him to !
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 31]: Oh , do have pity , and tell me what 's been done with the dear boy , gentlemen ; do , gentlemen , if you please , gentlemen ! '
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 36]: Having uttered those words in a most lamentable and heart-broken tone : to the immeasurable delight of her hearers : Miss Nancy paused , winked to the company , nodded smilingly round , and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 47]: ` Ah , she 's a clever girl , my dears , ' said the Jew , turning round to his young friends , and shaking his head gravely , as if in mute admonition to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 27]: ` She 's a honour to her sex , ' said Mr. Sikes , filling his glass , and smiting the table with his enormous fist .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 15]: ` Here 's her health , and wishing they was all like her ! '
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 54]: While these , and many other encomiums , were being passed on the accomplished Nancy , that young lady made the best of her way to the police-office ; whither , notwithstanding a little natural timidity consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected , she arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 21]: Entering by the back way , she tapped softly with the key at one of the cell-doors , and listened .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 13]: There was no sound within : so she coughed and listened again .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 10]: Still there was no reply : so she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 6]: ` Nolly , dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 11]: murmured Nancy in a gentle voice ; ` Nolly ? '
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 80]: There was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal , who had been taken up for playing the flute , and who , the offence against society having been clearly proved , had been very properly committed by Mr. Fang to the House of Correction for one month ; with the appropriate and amusing remark that since he had so much breath to spare , it would be more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical instrument .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 39]: He made no answer : being occupied mentally bewailing the loss of the flute , which had been confiscated for the use of the county : so Nancy passed on to the next cell , and knocked there .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 7]: cried a faint and feeble voice .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 9]: ` Is there a little boy here ? '
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 8]: inquired Nancy , with a preliminary sob .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 13]: ` No , ' replied the voice ; ` God forbid . '
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 37]: This was a vagrant of sixty-five , who was going to prison for NOT playing the flute ; or , in other words , for begging in the streets , and doing nothing for his livelihood .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 35]: In the next cell was another man , who was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without license ; thereby doing something for his living , in defiance of the Stamp-office .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 67]: But , as neither of these criminals answered to the name of Oliver , or knew anything about him , Nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in the striped waistcoat ; and with the most piteous wailings and lamentations , rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of the street-door key and the little basket , demanded her own dear brother . '
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 15]: I have n't got him , my dear , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 6]: ` Where is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 8]: screamed Nancy , in a distracted manner .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 14]: ` Why , the gentleman 's got him , ' replied the officer .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 4]: ` What gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 5]: Oh , gracious heavens !
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 4]: What gentleman ? '
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 3]: exclaimed Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 98]: In reply to this incoherent questioning , the old man informed the deeply affected sister that Oliver had been taken ill in the office , and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to have been committed by another boy , not in custody ; and that the prosecutor had carried him away , in an insensible condition , to his own residence : of and concerning which , all the informant knew was , that it was somewhere in Pentonville , he having heard that word mentioned in the directions to the coachman .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 50]: In a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty , the agonised young woman staggered to the gate , and then , exchanging her faltering walk for a swift run , returned by the most devious and complicated route she could think of , to the domicile of the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 46]: Mr. Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered , than he very hastily called up the white dog , and , putting on his hat , expeditiously departed : without devoting any time to the formality of wishing the company good-morning .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 23]: ` We must know where he is , my dears ; he must be found , ' said the Jew greatly excited .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 18]: ` Charley , do nothing but skulk about , till you bring home some news of him !
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 11]: Nancy , my dear , I must have him found .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 17]: I trust to you , my dear , -- to you and the Artful for everything !
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 25]: Stay , stay , ' added the Jew , unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand ; ` there 's money , my dears .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 8]: I shall shut up this shop to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 8]: You 'll know where to find me !
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 7]: Do n't stop here a minute .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 8]: Not an instant , my dears ! '
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 37]: With these words , he pushed them from the room : and carefully double-locking and barring the door behind them , drew from its place of concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 15]: Then , he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath his clothing .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 11]: A rap at the door startled him in this occupation .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 6]: ` Who 's there ? '
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 7]: he cried in a shrill tone .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 4]: ` Me ! '
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 11]: replied the voice of the Dodger , through the key-hole .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 5]: ` What now ? '
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 5]: cried the Jew impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 15]: ` Is he to be kidnapped to the other ken , Nancy says ? '
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 4]: inquired the Dodger .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 16]: ` Yes , ' replied the Jew , ` wherever she lays hands on him .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 11]: Find him , find him out , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 12]: I shall know what to do next ; never fear . '
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 15]: The boy murmured a reply of intelligence : and hurried downstairs after his companions .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 18]: ` He has not peached so far , ' said the Jew as he pursued his occupation .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 20]: ` If he means to blab us among his new friends , we may stop his mouth yet . '
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 99]: CHAPTER XIV COMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER 'S STAY AT MR. BROWNLOW 'S , WITH THE REMARKABLE PREDICTION WHICH ONE MR. GRIMWIG UTTERED CONCERNING HIM , WHEN HE WENT OUT ON AN ERRAND Oliver soon recovering from the fainting-fit into which Mr. Brownlow 's abrupt exclamation had thrown him , the subject of the picture was carefully avoided , both by the old gentleman and Mrs. Bedwin , in the conversation that ensued : which indeed bore no reference to Oliver 's history or prospects , but was confined to such topics as might amuse without exciting him .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 52]: He was still too weak to get up to breakfast ; but , when he came down into the housekeeper 's room next day , his first act was to cast an eager glance at the wall , in the hope of again looking on the face of the beautiful lady .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 14]: His expectations were disappointed , however , for the picture had been removed .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 12]: said the housekeeper , watching the direction of Oliver 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 10]: ` It is gone , you see . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 10]: I see it is ma'am , ' replied Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 9]: ` Why have they taken it away ? '
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 39]: ` It has been taken down , child , because Mr. Brownlow said , that as it seemed to worry you , perhaps it might prevent your getting well , you know , ' rejoined the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 7]: ` Oh , no , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 13]: It did n't worry me , ma'am , ' said Oliver . '
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 6]: I liked to see it .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 6]: I quite loved it . '
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 6]: ` Well , well ! '
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 28]: said the old lady , good-humouredly ; ` you get well as fast as ever you can , dear , and it shall be hung up again .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 5]: I promise you that !
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 10]: Now , let us talk about something else . '
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 15]: This was all the information Oliver could obtain about the picture at that time .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 115]: As the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness , he endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then ; so he listened attentively to a great many stories she told him , about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers , who was married to an amiable and handsome man , and lived in the country ; and about a son , who was clerk to a merchant in the West Indies ; and who was , also , such a good young man , and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a-year , that it brought the tears into her eyes to talk about them .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 39]: When the old lady had expatiated , a long time , on the excellences of her children , and the merits of her kind good husband besides , who had been dead and gone , poor dear soul !
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 11]: just six-and-twenty years , it was time to have tea .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 62]: After tea she began to teach Oliver cribbage : which he learnt as quickly as she could teach : and at which game they played , with great interest and gravity , until it was time for the invalid to have some warm wine and water , with a slice of dry toast , and then to go cosily to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 11]: They were happy days , those of Oliver 's recovery .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 39]: Everything was so quiet , and neat , and orderly ; everybody so kind and gentle ; that after the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived , it seemed like Heaven itself .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 41]: He was no sooner strong enough to put his clothes on , properly , than Mr. Brownlow caused a complete new suit , and a new cap , and a new pair of shoes , to be provided for him .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 47]: As Oliver was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes , he gave them to a servant who had been very kind to him , and asked her to sell them to a Jew , and keep the money for herself .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 61]: This she very readily did ; and , as Oliver looked out of the parlour window , and saw the Jew roll them up in his bag and walk away , he felt quite delighted to think that they were safely gone , and that there was now no possible danger of his ever being able to wear them again .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 20]: They were sad rags , to tell the truth ; and Oliver had never had a new suit before .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 57]: One evening , about a week after the affair of the picture , as he was sitting talking to Mrs. Bedwin , there came a message down from Mr. Brownlow , that if Oliver Twist felt pretty well , he should like to see him in his study , and talk to him a little while .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 8]: ` Bless us , and save us !
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 21]: Wash your hands , and let me part your hair nicely for you , child , ' said Mrs. Bedwin .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 5]: ` Dear heart alive !
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 30]: If we had known he would have asked for you , we would have put you a clean collar on , and made you as smart as sixpence ! '
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 95]: Oliver did as the old lady bade him ; and , although she lamented grievously , meanwhile , that there was not even time to crimp the little frill that bordered his shirt-collar ; he looked so delicate and handsome , despite that important personal advantage , that she went so far as to say : looking at him with great complacency from head to foot , that she really did n't think it would have been possible , on the longest notice , to have made much difference in him for the better .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 10]: Thus encouraged , Oliver tapped at the study door .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 35]: On Mr. Brownlow calling to him to come in , he found himself in a little back room , quite full of books , with a window , looking into some pleasant little gardens .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 18]: There was a table drawn up before the window , at which Mr. Brownlow was seated reading .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 26]: When he saw Oliver , he pushed the book away from him , and told him to come near the table , and sit down .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 29]: Oliver complied ; marvelling where the people could be found to read such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world wiser .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 19]: Which is still a marvel to more experienced people than Oliver Twist , every day of their lives .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 16]: ` There are a good many books , are there not , my boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 23]: said Mr. Brownlow , observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed the shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling . '
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 11]: A great number , sir , ' replied Oliver . '
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 7]: I never saw so many . '
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 58]: ` You shall read them , if you behave well , ' said the old gentleman kindly ; ` and you will like that , better than looking at the outsides , -- that is , some cases ; because there are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 30]: I suppose they are those heavy ones , sir , ' said Oliver , pointing to some large quartos , with a good deal of gilding about the binding .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 39]: ` Not always those , ' said the old gentleman , patting Oliver on the head , and smiling as he did so ; ` there are other equally heavy ones , though of a much smaller size .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 19]: How should you like to grow up a clever man , and write books , eh ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 14]: I think I would rather read them , sir , ' replied Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 10]: would n't you like to be a book-writer ? '
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 5]: said the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 44]: Oliver considered a little while ; and at last said , he should think it would be a much better thing to be a book-seller ; upon which the old gentleman laughed heartily , and declared he had said a very good thing .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 18]: Which Oliver felt glad to have done , though he by no means knew what it was .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 15]: ` Well , well , ' said the old gentleman , composing his features .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 6]: ` Do n't be afraid !
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 26]: We wo n't make an author of you , while there 's an honest trade to be learnt , or brick-making to turn to . '
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 10]: ` Thank you , sir , ' said Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 35]: At the earnest manner of his reply , the old gentleman laughed again ; and said something about a curious instinct , which Oliver , not understanding , paid no very great attention to .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 56]: ` Now , ' said Mr. Brownlow , speaking if possible in a kinder , but at the same time in a much more serious manner , than Oliver had ever known him assume yet , ' I want you to pay great attention , my boy , to what I am going to say .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 29]: I shall talk to you without any reserve ; because I am sure you are well able to understand me , as many older persons would be . '
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 19]: ` Oh , do n't tell you are going to send me away , sir , pray ! '
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 15]: exclaimed Oliver , alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman 's commencement !
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 15]: ` Do n't turn me out of doors to wander in the streets again .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 10]: Let me stay here , and be a servant .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 13]: Do n't send me back to the wretched place I came from .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 10]: Have mercy upon a poor boy , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 40]: ` My dear child , ' said the old gentleman , moved by the warmth of Oliver 's sudden appeal ; ` you need not be afraid of my deserting you , unless you give me cause . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 13]: I never , never will , sir , ' interposed Oliver . '
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 11]: I hope not , ' rejoined the old gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 8]: I do not think you ever will .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 47]: I have been deceived , before , in the objects whom I have endeavoured to benefit ; but I feel strongly disposed to trust you , nevertheless ; and I am more interested in your behalf than I can well account for , even to myself .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 54]: The persons on whom I have bestowed my dearest love , lie deep in their graves ; but , although the happiness and delight of my life lie buried there too , I have not made a coffin of my heart , and sealed it up , forever , on my best affections .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 10]: Deep affliction has but strengthened and refined them . '
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 35]: As the old gentleman said this in a low voice : more to himself than to his companion : and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards : Oliver sat quite still .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 6]: ` Well , well ! '
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 51]: said the old gentleman at length , in a more cheerful tone , ' I only say this , because you have a young heart ; and knowing that I have suffered great pain and sorrow , you will be more careful , perhaps , not to wound me again .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 28]: You say you are an orphan , without a friend in the world ; all the inquiries I have been able to make , confirm the statement .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 29]: Let me hear your story ; where you come from ; who brought you up ; and how you got into the company in which I found you .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 15]: Speak the truth , and you shall not be friendless while I live . '
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 61]: Oliver 's sobs checked his utterance for some minutes ; when he was on the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the farm , and carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble , a peculiarly impatient little double-knock was heard at the street-door : and the servant , running upstairs , announced Mr. Grimwig .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 7]: ` Is he coming up ? '
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 4]: inquired Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 10]: ` Yes , sir , ' replied the servant .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 29]: ` He asked if there were any muffins in the house ; and , when I told him yes , he said he had come to tea . '
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 51]: Mr. Brownlow smiled ; and , turning to Oliver , said that Mr. Grimwig was an old friend of his , and he must not mind his being a little rough in his manners ; for he was a worthy creature at bottom , as he had reason to know .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 9]: ` Shall I go downstairs , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 3]: inquired Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 17]: ` No , ' replied Mr. Brownlow , ' I would rather you remained here . '
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 58]: At this moment , there walked into the room : supporting himself by a thick stick : a stout old gentleman , rather lame in one leg , who was dressed in a blue coat , striped waistcoat , nankeen breeches and gaiters , and a broad-brimmed white hat , with the sides turned up with green .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 32]: A very small-plaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat ; and a very long steel watch-chain , with nothing but a key at the end , dangled loosely below it .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 32]: The ends of his white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about the size of an orange ; the variety of shapes into which his countenance was twisted , defy description .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 39]: He had a manner of screwing his head on one side when he spoke ; and of looking out of the corners of his eyes at the same time : which irresistibly reminded the beholder of a parrot .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 38]: In this attitude , he fixed himself , the moment he made his appearance ; and , holding out a small piece of orange-peel at arm 's length , exclaimed , in a growling , discontented voice .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 4]: ` Look here !
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 5]: do you see this !
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 34]: Is n't it a most wonderful and extraordinary thing that I ca n't call at a man 's house but I find a piece of this poor surgeon 's friend on the staircase ?
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 31]: I 've been lamed with orange-peel once , and I know orange-peel will be my death , or I 'll be content to eat my own head , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 115]: This was the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed nearly every assertion he made ; and it was the more singular in his case , because , even admitting for the sake of argument , the possibility of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed , Mr. Grimwig 's head was such a particularly large one , that the most sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get through it at a sitting -- to put entirely out of the question , a very thick coating of powder .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 21]: ` I 'll eat my head , sir , ' repeated Mr. Grimwig , striking his stick upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 3]: ` Hallo !
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 5]: what 's that ! '
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 11]: looking at Oliver , and retreating a pace or two .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 18]: ` This is young Oliver Twist , whom we were speaking about , ' said Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 3]: Oliver bowed .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 20]: ` You do n't mean to say that 's the boy who had the fever , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 9]: said Mr. Grimwig , recoiling a little more .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 5]: ` Wait a minute !
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 4]: Do n't speak !
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 32]: Stop -- ' continued Mr. Grimwig , abruptly , losing all dread of the fever in his triumph at the discovery ; ` that 's the boy who had the orange !
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 35]: If that 's not the boy , sir , who had the orange , and threw this bit of peel upon the staircase , I 'll eat my head , and his too . '
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 18]: ` No , no , he has not had one , ' said Mr. Brownlow , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 3]: ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 14]: Put down your hat ; and speak to my young friend . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 21]: I feel strongly on this subject , sir , ' said the irritable old gentleman , drawing off his gloves .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 31]: ` There 's always more or less orange-peel on the pavement in our street ; and I KNOW it 's put there by the surgeon 's boy at the corner .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 33]: A young woman stumbled over a bit last night , and fell against my garden-railings ; directly she got up I saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomime-light .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 21]: `` Do n't go to him , '' I called out of the window , `` he 's an assassin !
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 4]: A man-trap ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 4]: So he is .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 45]: If he is not -- ' Here the irascible old gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his stick ; which was always understood , by his friends , to imply the customary offer , whenever it was not expressed in words .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 54]: Then , still keeping his stick in his hand , he sat down ; and , opening a double eye-glass , which he wore attached to a broad black riband , took a view of Oliver : who , seeing that he was the object of inspection , coloured , and bowed again .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 10]: ` That 's the boy , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 7]: said Mr. Grimwig , at length .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 11]: ` That 's the boy , ' replied Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 8]: ` How are you , boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 5]: said Mr. Grimwig . '
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 14]: A great deal better , thank you , sir , ' replied Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 52]: Mr Brownlow , seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about to say something disagreeable , asked Oliver to step downstairs and tell Mrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea ; which , as he did not half like the visitor 's manner , he was very happy to do .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 12]: ` He is a nice-looking boy , is he not ? '
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 5]: inquired Mr. Brownlow . '
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 12]: I do n't know , ' replied Mr. Grimwig , pettishly .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 6]: ` Do n't know ? '
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 8]: I never see any difference in boys .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 8]: I only knew two sort of boys .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 8]: Mealy boys , and beef-faced boys . '
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 7]: ` And which is Oliver ? '
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 3]: ` Mealy .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 68]: I know a friend who has a beef-faced boy ; a fine boy , they call him ; with a round head , and red cheeks , and glaring eyes ; a horrid boy ; with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of his blue clothes ; with the voice of a pilot , and the appetite of a wolf .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 4]: I know him !
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 4]: The wretch ! '
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 28]: ` Come , ' said Mr. Brownlow , ` these are not the characteristics of young Oliver Twist ; so he need n't excite your wrath . '
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 10]: ` They are not , ' replied Mr. Grimwig .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 7]: ` He may have worse . '
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 18]: Here , Mr. Brownlow coughed impatiently ; which appeared to afford Mr. Grimwig the most exquisite delight .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 14]: ` He may have worse , I say , ' repeated Mr. Grimwig .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 7]: ` Where does he come from !
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 4]: Who is he ?
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 4]: What is he ?
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 6]: He has had a fever .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 4]: What of that ?
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 11]: Fevers are not peculiar to good peope ; are they ?
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 12]: Bad people have fevers sometimes ; have n't they , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 14]: I knew a man who was hung in Jamaica for murdering his master .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 18]: He had had a fever six times ; he was n't recommended to mercy on that account .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 2]: Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 3]: nonsense ! '
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 85]: Now , the fact was , that in the inmost recesses of his own heart , Mr. Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver 's appearance and manner were unusually prepossessing ; but he had a strong appetite for contradiction , sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the orange-peel ; and , inwardly determining that no man should dictate to him whether a boy was well-looking or not , he had resolved , from the first , to oppose his friend .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 48]: When Mr. Brownlow admitted that on no one point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer ; and that he had postponed any investigation into Oliver 's previous history until he thought the boy was strong enough to hear it ; Mr. Grimwig chuckled maliciously .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 49]: And he demanded , with a sneer , whether the housekeeper was in the habit of counting the plate at night ; because if she did n't find a table-spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning , why , he would be content to -- and so forth .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 81]: All this , Mr. Brownlow , although himself somewhat of an impetuous gentleman : knowing his friend 's peculiarities , bore with great good humour ; as Mr. Grimwig , at tea , was graciously pleased to express his entire approval of the muffins , matters went on very smoothly ; and Oliver , who made one of the party , began to feel more at his ease than he had yet done in the fierce old gentleman 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 26]: ` And when are you going to hear at full , true , and particular account of the life and adventures of Oliver Twist ? '
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 24]: asked Grimwig of Mr. Brownlow , at the conclusion of the meal ; looking sideways at Oliver , as he resumed his subject .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 10]: ` To-morrow morning , ' replied Mr. Brownlow . '
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 12]: I would rather he was alone with me at the time .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 14]: Come up to me to-morrow morning at ten o'clock , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 9]: ` Yes , sir , ' replied Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 20]: He answered with some hesitation , because he was confused by Mr. Grimwig 's looking so hard at him .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 26]: ` I 'll tell you what , ' whispered that gentleman to Mr. Brownlow ; ` he wo n't come up to you to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 5]: I saw him hesitate .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 10]: He is deceiving you , my good friend . '
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 15]: ` I 'll swear he is not , ' replied Mr. Brownlow , warmly .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 22]: ` If he is not , ' said Mr. Grimwig , ` I 'll -- ' and down went the stick .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 14]: ` I 'll answer for that boy 's truth with my life ! '
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 8]: said Mr. Brownlow , knocking the table .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 11]: ` And I for his falsehood with my head ! '
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 9]: rejoined Mr. Grimwig , knocking the table also .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 15]: ` We shall see , ' said Mr. Brownlow , checking his rising anger .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 19]: ` We will , ' replied Mr. Grimwig , with a provoking smile ; ` we will . '
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 57]: As fate would have it , Mrs. Bedwin chanced to bring in , at this moment , a small parcel of books , which Mr. Brownlow had that morning purchased of the identical bookstall-keeper , who has already figured in this history ; having laid them on the table , she prepared to leave the room .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 9]: ` Stop the boy , Mrs. Bedwin ! '
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 13]: said Mr. Brownlow ; ` there is something to go back . '
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 12]: ` He has gone , sir , ' replied Mrs. Bedwin .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 15]: ` Call after him , ' said Mr. Brownlow ; ` it 's particular .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 13]: He is a poor man , and they are not paid for .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 12]: There are some books to be taken back , too . '
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 5]: The street-door was opened .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 32]: Oliver ran one way ; and the girl ran another ; and Mrs. Bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy ; but there was no boy in sight .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 21]: Oliver and the girl returned , in a breathless state , to report that there were no tidings of him .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 28]: ` Dear me , I am very sorry for that , ' exclaimed Mr. Brownlow ; ' I particularly wished those books to be returned to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 30]: ` Send Oliver with them , ' said Mr. Grimwig , with an ironical smile ; ` he will be sure to deliver them safely , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 19]: ` Yes ; do let me take them , if you please , sir , ' said Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 11]: ` I 'll run all the way , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 63]: The old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should not go out on any account ; when a most malicious cough from Mr. Grimwig determined him that he should ; and that , by his prompt discharge of the commission , he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions : on this head at least : at once .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 14]: ` You SHALL go , my dear , ' said the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 11]: ` The books are on a chair by my table .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 5]: Fetch them down . '
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 36]: Oliver , delighted to be of use , brought down the books under his arm in a great bustle ; and waited , cap in hand , to hear what message he was to take .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 44]: ` You are to say , ' said Mr. Brownlow , glancing steadily at Grimwig ; ` you are to say that you have brought those books back ; and that you have come to pay the four pound ten I owe him .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 21]: This is a five-pound note , so you will have to bring me back , ten shillings change . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 15]: I wo n't be ten minutes , sir , ' said Oliver , eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 30]: Having buttoned up the bank-note in his jacket pocket , and placed the books carefully under his arm , he made a respectful bow , and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 40]: Mrs. Bedwin followed him to the street-door , giving him many directions about the nearest way , and the name of the bookseller , and the name of the street : all of which Oliver said he clearly understood .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 22]: Having superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold , the old lady at length permitted him to depart .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 7]: ` Bless his sweet face ! '
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 10]: said the old lady , looking after him . '
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 17]: I ca n't bear , somehow , to let him go out of my sight . '
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 17]: At this moment , Oliver looked gaily round , and nodded before he turned the corner .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 22]: The old lady smilingly returned his salutation , and , closing the door , went back , to her own room .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 34]: ` Let me see ; he 'll be back in twenty minutes , at the longest , ' said Mr. Brownlow , pulling out his watch , and placing it on the table .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 10]: ` It will be dark by that time . '
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 12]: you really expect him to come back , do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 4]: inquired Mr. Grimwig .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 6]: ` Do n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 6]: asked Mr. Brownlow , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 28]: The spirit of contradiction was strong in Mr. Grimwig 's breast , at the moment ; and it was rendered stronger by his friend 's confident smile .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 19]: ` No , ' he said , smiting the table with his fist , ' I do not .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 29]: The boy has a new suit of clothes on his back , a set of valuable books under his arm , and a five-pound note in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 14]: He 'll join his old friends the thieves , and laugh at you .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 18]: If ever that boy returns to this house , sir , I 'll eat my head . '
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 29]: With these words he drew his chair closer to the table ; and there the two friends sat , in silent expectation , with the watch between them .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 83]: It is worthy of remark , as illustrating the importance we attach to our own judgments , and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and hasty conclusions , that , although Mr. Grimwig was not by any means a bad-hearted man , and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see his respected friend duped and deceived , he really did most earnestly and strongly hope at that moment , that Oliver Twist might not come back .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 34]: It grew so dark , that the figures on the dial-plate were scarcely discernible ; but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit , in silence , with the watch between them .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 123]: CHAPTER XV SHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST , THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY WERE In the obscure parlour of a low public-house , in the filthiest part of Little Saffron Hill ; a dark and gloomy den , where a flaring gas-light burnt all day in the winter-time ; and where no ray of sun ever shone in the summer : there sat , brooding over a little pewter measure and a small glass , strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor , a man in a velveteen coat , drab shorts , half-boots and stockings , whom even by that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated to recognise as Mr. William Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 56]: At his feet , sat a white-coated , red-eyed dog ; who occupied himself , alternately , in winking at his master with both eyes at the same time ; and in licking a large , fresh cut on one side of his mouth , which appeared to be the result of some recent conflict .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 7]: ` Keep quiet , you warmint !
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 4]: Keep quiet ! '
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 8]: said Mr. Sikes , suddenly breaking silence .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 50]: Whether his meditations were so intense as to be disturbed by the dog 's winking , or whether his feelings were so wrought upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them , is matter for argument and consideration .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 20]: Whatever was the cause , the effect was a kick and a curse , bestowed upon the dog simultaneously .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 63]: Dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by their masters ; but Mr. Sikes 's dog , having faults of temper in common with his owner , and labouring , perhaps , at this moment , under a powerful sense of injury , made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth in one of the half-boots .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 29]: Having given in a hearty shake , he retired , growling , under a form ; just escaping the pewter measure which Mr. Sikes levelled at his head .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 8]: ` You would , would you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 27]: said Sikes , seizing the poker in one hand , and deliberately opening with the other a large clasp-knife , which he drew from his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 8]: ` Come here , you born devil !
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 3]: Come here !
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 4]: D'ye hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 71]: The dog no doubt heard ; because Mr. Sikes spoke in the very harshest key of a very harsh voice ; but , appearing to entertain some unaccountable objection to having his throat cut , he remained where he was , and growled more fiercely than before : at the same time grasping the end of the poker between his teeth , and biting at it like a wild beast .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 24]: This resistance only infuriated Mr. Sikes the more ; who , dropping on his knees , began to assail the animal most furiously .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 71]: The dog jumped from right to left , and from left to right ; snapping , growling , and barking ; the man thrust and swore , and struck and blasphemed ; and the struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other ; when , the door suddenly opening , the dog darted out : leaving Bill Sikes with the poker and the clasp-knife in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 15]: There must always be two parties to a quarrel , says the old adage .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 24]: Mr. Sikes , being disappointed of the dog 's participation , at once transferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 16]: ` What the devil do you come in between me and my dog for ? '
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 9]: said Sikes , with a fierce gesture . '
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 27]: I did n't know , my dear , I did n't know , ' replied Fagin , humbly ; for the Jew was the new comer .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 10]: ` Did n't know , you white-livered thief ! '
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 3]: growled Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 9]: ` Could n't you hear the noise ? '
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 21]: ` Not a sound of it , as I 'm a living man , Bill , ' replied the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 4]: ` Oh no !
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 16]: You hear nothing , you do n't , ' retorted Sikes with a fierce sneer .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 16]: ` Sneaking in and out , so as nobody hears how you come or go !
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 16]: I wish you had been the dog , Fagin , half a minute ago . '
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 4]: ` Why ? '
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 8]: inquired the Jew with a forced smile .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 54]: 'Cause the government , as cares for the lives of such men as you , as have n't half the pluck of curs , lets a man kill a dog how he likes , ' replied Sikes , shutting up the knife with a very expressive look ; ` that 's why . '
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 24]: The Jew rubbed his hands ; and , sitting down at the table , affected to laugh at the pleasantry of his friend .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 10]: He was obviously very ill at ease , however .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 23]: ` Grin away , ' said Sikes , replacing the poker , and surveying him with savage contempt ; ` grin away .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 18]: You 'll never have the laugh at me , though , unless it 's behind a nightcap .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 22]: I 've got the upper hand over you , Fagin ; and , d -- me , I 'll keep it .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 14]: If I go , you go ; so take care of me . '
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 36]: ` Well , well , my dear , ' said the Jew , ' I know all that ; we -- we -- have a mutual interest , Bill , -- a mutual interest . '
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 25]: ` Humph , ' said Sikes , as if he though the interest lay rather more on the Jew 's side than on his .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 13]: ` Well , what have you got to say to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 21]: ` It 's all passed safe through the melting-pot , ' replied Fagin , ` and this is your share .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 42]: It 's rather more than it ought to be , my dear ; but as I know you 'll do me a good turn another time , and -- ' ` Stow that gammon , ' interposed the robber , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 5]: ` Where is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 4]: Hand over ! '
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 22]: ` Yes , yes , Bill ; give me time , give me time , ' replied the Jew , soothingly .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 5]: ` Here it is !
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 4]: All safe ! '
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 30]: As he spoke , he drew forth an old cotton handkerchief from his breast ; and untying a large knot in one corner , produced a small brown-paper packet .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 20]: Sikes , snatching it from him , hastily opened it ; and proceeded to count the sovereigns it contained .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 9]: ` This is all , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 3]: inquired Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 8]: ` All , ' replied the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 21]: ` You have n't opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along , have you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 5]: inquired Sikes , suspiciously .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 20]: ` Do n't put on an injured look at the question ; you 've done it many a time .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 5]: Jerk the tinkler . '
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 15]: These words , in plain English , conveyed an injunction to ring the bell .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 20]: It was answered by another Jew : younger than Fagin , but nearly as vile and repulsive in appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 9]: Bill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 59]: The Jew , perfectly understanding the hint , retired to fill it : previously exchanging a remarkable look with Fagin , who raised his eyes for an instant , as if in expectation of it , and shook his head in reply ; so slightly that the action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third person .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 22]: It was lost upon Sikes , who was stooping at the moment to tie the boot-lace which the dog had torn .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 24]: Possibly , if he had observed the brief interchange of signals , he might have thought that it boded no good to him .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 8]: ` Is anybody here , Barney ? '
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 21]: inquired Fagin ; speaking , now that that Sikes was looking on , without raising his eyes from the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 28]: ` Dot a shoul , ' replied Barney ; whose words : whether they came from the heart or not : made their way through the nose .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 4]: ` Nobody ? '
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 23]: inquired Fagin , in a tone of surprise : which perhaps might mean that Barney was at liberty to tell the truth .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 10]: ` Dobody but Biss Dadsy , ' replied Barney .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 4]: ` Nancy ! '
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 3]: exclaimed Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 3]: ` Where ?
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 20]: Strike me blind , if I do n't honour that ` ere girl , for her native talents . '
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 18]: ` She 's bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar , ' replied Barney .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 16]: ` Send her here , ' said Sikes , pouring out a glass of liquor .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 6]: ` Send her here . '
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 53]: Barney looked timidly at Fagin , as if for permission ; the Jew reamining silent , and not lifting his eyes from the ground , he retired ; and presently returned , ushering in Nancy ; who was decorated with the bonnet , apron , basket , and street-door key , complete .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 13]: ` You are on the scent , are you , Nancy ? '
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 7]: inquired Sikes , proffering the glass .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 30]: ` Yes , I am , Bill , ' replied the young lady , disposing of its contents ; ` and tired enough of it I am , too .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 23]: The young brat 's been ill and confined to the crib ; and -- ' ` Ah , Nancy , dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 6]: said Fagin , looking up .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 42]: Now , whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew 's red eye-brows , and a half closing of his deeply-set eyes , warned Miss Nancy that she was disposed to be too communicative , is not a matter of much importance .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 37]: The fact is all we need care for here ; and the fact is , that she suddenly checked herself , and with several gracious smiles upon Mr. Sikes , turned the conversation to other matters .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 35]: In about ten minutes ' time , Mr. Fagin was seized with a fit of coughing ; upon which Nancy pulled her shawl over her shoulders , and declared it was time to go .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 55]: Mr. Sikes , finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself , expressed his intention of accompanying her ; they went away together , followed , at a little distant , by the dog , who slunk out of a back-yard as soon as his master was out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 67]: The Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes had left it ; looked after him as we walked up the dark passage ; shook his clenched fist ; muttered a deep curse ; and then , with a horrible grin , reseated himself at the table ; where he was soon deeply absorbed in the interesting pages of the Hue-and -- Cry .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 30]: Meanwhile , Oliver Twist , little dreaming that he was within so very short a distance of the merry old gentleman , was on his way to the book-stall .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 72]: When he got into Clerkenwell , he accidently turned down a by-street which was not exactly in his way ; but not discovering his mistake until he had got half-way down it , and knowing it must lead in the right direction , he did not think it worth while to turn back ; and so marched on , as quickly as he could , with the books under his arm .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 58]: He was walking along , thinking how happy and contented he ought to feel ; and how much he would give for only one look at poor little Dick , who , starved and beaten , might be weeping bitterly at that very moment ; when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 8]: ` Oh , my dear brother ! '
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 30]: And he had hardly looked up , to see what the matter was , when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round his neck .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 10]: ` Do n't , ' cried Oliver , struggling .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 6]: ` Let go of me .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 4]: Who is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 8]: What are you stopping me for ? '
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 36]: The only reply to this , was a great number of loud lamentations from the young woman who had embraced him ; and who had a little basket and a street-door key in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 6]: ` Oh my gracious ! '
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 11]: said the young woman , ' I have found him !
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 2]: Oliver !
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 2]: Oliver !
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 15]: Oh you naughty boy , to make me suffer such distress on your account !
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 7]: Come home , dear , come .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 7]: Oh , I 've found him .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 11]: Thank gracious goodness heavins , I 've found him ! '
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 66]: With these incoherent exclamations , the young woman burst into another fit of crying , and got so dreadfully hysterical , that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a butcher 's boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet , who was also looking on , whether he did n't think he had better run for the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 27]: To which , the butcher 's boy : who appeared of a lounging , not to say indolent disposition : replied , that he thought not .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 27]: ` Oh , no , no , never mind , ' said the young woman , grasping Oliver 's hand ; ` I 'm better now .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 8]: Come home directly , you cruel boy !
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 3]: Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 53]: ` Oh , ma'am , ' replied the young woman , ` he ran away , near a month ago , from his parents , who are hard-working and respectable people ; and went and joined a set of thieves and bad characters ; and almost broke his mother 's heart . '
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 5]: ` Young wretch ! '
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 4]: said one woman .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 16]: ` Go home , do , you little brute , ' said the other . '
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 12]: I am not , ' replied Oliver , greatly alarmed . '
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 6]: I do n't know her .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 12]: I have n't any sister , or father and mother either .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 11]: I 'm an orphan ; I live at Pentonville . '
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 12]: ` Only hear him , how he braves it out ! '
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 5]: cried the young woman .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 8]: ` Why , it 's Nancy ! '
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 21]: exclaimed Oliver ; who now saw her face for the first time ; and started back , in irrepressible astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 8]: ` You see he knows me ! '
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 8]: cried Nancy , appealing to the bystanders .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 7]: ` He ca n't help himself .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 26]: Make him come home , there 's good people , or he 'll kill his dear mother and father , and break my heart ! '
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 8]: ` What the devil 's this ? '
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 22]: said a man , bursting out of a beer-shop , with a white dog at his heels ; ` young Oliver !
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 11]: Come home to your poor mother , you young dog !
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 6]: Come home directly . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 7]: I do n't belong to them .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 6]: I do n't know them .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 2]: Help !
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 2]: help !
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 11]: cried Oliver , struggling in the man 's powerful grasp .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 4]: ` Help ! '
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 4]: repeated the man .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 12]: ` Yes ; I 'll help you , you young rascal !
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 5]: What books are these ?
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 10]: You 've been a stealing 'em , have you ?
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 5]: Give 'em here . '
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 20]: With these words , the man tore the volumes from his grasp , and struck him on the head .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 6]: ` That 's right ! '
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 8]: cried a looker-on , from a garret-window .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 14]: ` That 's the only way of bringing him to his senses ! '
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 6]: ` To be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 13]: cried a sleepy-faced carpenter , casting an approving look at the garret-window .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 8]: ` It 'll do him good ! '
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 5]: said the two women .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 10]: ` And he shall have it , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 15]: rejoined the man , administering another blow , and seizing Oliver by the collar .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 8]: ` Come on , you young villain !
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 12]: Here , Bull 's - eye , mind him , boy !
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 4]: Mind him ! '
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 60]: Weak with recent illness ; stupified by the blows and the suddenness of the attack ; terrified by the fierce growling of the dog , and the brutality of the man ; overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders that he really was the hardened little wretch he was described to be ; what could one poor child do !
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 20]: Darkness had set in ; it was a low neighborhood ; no help was near ; resistance was useless .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 36]: In another moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts , and was forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to give utterance to , unintelligible .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 31]: It was of little moment , indeed , whether they were intelligible or no ; for there was nobody to care for them , had they been ever so plain .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 64]: * * * * * * * * * The gas-lamps were lighted ; Mrs. Bedwin was waiting anxiously at the open door ; the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if there were any traces of Oliver ; and still the two old gentlemen sat , perseveringly , in the dark parlour , with the watch between them .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 48]: CHAPTER XVI RELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST , AFTER HE HAD BEEN CLAIMED BY NANCY The narrow streets and courts , at length , terminated in a large open space ; scattered about which , were pens for beasts , and other indications of a cattle-market .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 30]: Sikes slackened his pace when they reached this spot : the girl being quite unable to support any longer , the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 16]: Turning to Oliver , he roughly commanded him to take hold of Nancy 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 6]: ` Do you hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 11]: growled Sikes , as Oliver hesitated , and looked round .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 15]: They were in a dark corner , quite out of the track of passengers .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 15]: Oliver saw , but too plainly , that resistance would be of no avail .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 13]: He held out his hand , which Nancy clasped tight in hers .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 16]: ` Give me the other , ' said Sikes , seizing Oliver 's unoccupied hand .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 9]: ` Here , Bull 's -- Eye ! '
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 8]: The dog looked up , and growled .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 7]: ` See here , boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 25]: said Sikes , putting his other hand to Oliver 's throat ; ` if he speaks ever so soft a word , hold him !
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 4]: D'ye mind ! '
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 26]: The dog growled again ; and licking his lips , eyed Oliver as if he were anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 18]: ` He 's as willing as a Christian , strike me blind if he is n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 15]: said Sikes , regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 31]: ` Now , you know what you 've got to expect , master , so call away as quick as you like ; the dog will soon stop that game .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 8]: Get on , young ` un ! '
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 36]: Bull 's - eye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually endearing form of speech ; and , giving vent to another admonitory growl for the benefit of Oliver , led the way onward .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 24]: It was Smithfield that they were crossing , although it might have been Grosvenor Square , for anything Oliver knew to the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 7]: The night was dark and foggy .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 47]: The lights in the shops could scarecely struggle through the heavy mist , which thickened every moment and shrouded the streets and houses in gloom ; rendering the strange place still stranger in Oliver 's eyes ; and making his uncertainty the more dismal and depressing .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 16]: They had hurried on a few paces , when a deep church-bell struck the hour .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 22]: With its first stroke , his two conductors stopped , and turned their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 17]: ` Eight o ' clock , Bill , ' said Nancy , when the bell ceased .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 20]: ` What 's the good of telling me that ; I can hear it , ca n't I ! '
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 4]: replied Sikes . '
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 12]: I wonder whether THEY can hear it , ' said Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 10]: ` Of course they can , ' replied Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 30]: ` It was Bartlemy time when I was shopped ; and there war n't a penny trumpet in the fair , as I could n't hear the squeaking on .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 40]: Arter I was locked up for the night , the row and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent , that I could almost have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door . '
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 5]: ` Poor fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 19]: said Nancy , who still had her face turned towards the quarter in which the bell had sounded .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 13]: ` Oh , Bill , such fine young chaps as them ! '
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 15]: ` Yes ; that 's all you women think of , ' answered Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 5]: ` Fine young chaps !
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 17]: Well , they 're as good as dead , so it do n't much matter . '
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 31]: With this consolation , Mr. Sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency to jealousy , and , clasping Oliver 's wrist more firmly , told him to step out again .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 6]: ` Wait a minute ! '
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 32]: said the girl : ' I would n't hurry by , if it was you that was coming out to be hung , the next time eight o'clock struck , Bill .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 31]: I 'd walk round and round the place till I dropped , if the snow was on the ground , and I had n't a shawl to cover me . '
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 9]: ` And what good would that do ? '
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 6]: inquired the unsentimental Mr. Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 41]: ` Unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout rope , you might as well be walking fifty mile off , or not walking at all , for all the good it would do me .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 11]: Come on , and do n't stand preaching there . '
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 20]: The girl burst into a laugh ; drew her shawl more closely round her ; and they walked away .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 29]: But Oliver felt her hand tremble , and , looking up in her face as they passed a gas-lamp , saw that it had turned a deadly white .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 39]: They walked on , by little-frequented and dirty ways , for a full half-hour : meeting very few people , and those appearing from their looks to hold much the same position in society as Mr. Sikes himself .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 87]: At length they turned into a very filthy narrow street , nearly full of old-clothes shops ; the dog running forward , as if conscious that there was no further occasion for his keeping on guard , stopped before the door of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted ; the house was in a ruinous condition , and on the door was nailed a board , intimating that it was to let : which looked as if it had hung there for many years .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 12]: ` All right , ' cried Sikes , glancing cautiously about .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 15]: Nancy stooped below the shutters , and Oliver heard the sound of a bell .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 20]: They crossed to the opposite side of the street , and stood for a few moments under a lamp .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 23]: A noise , as if a sash window were gently raised , was heard ; and soon afterwards the door softly opened .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 24]: Mr. Sikes then seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony ; and all three were quickly inside the house .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 6]: The passage was perfectly dark .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 18]: They waited , while the person who had let them in , chained and barred the door .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 5]: ` Anybody here ? '
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 3]: inquired Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 16]: ` No , ' replied a voice , which Oliver thought he had heard before .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 9]: ` Is the old ` un here ? '
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 4]: asked the robber .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 19]: ` Yes , ' replied the voice , ` and precious down in the mouth he has been .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 9]: Wo n't he be glad to see you ?
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 5]: Oh , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 38]: The style of this reply , as well as the voice which delivered it , seemed familiar to Oliver 's ears : but it was impossible to distinguish even the form of the speaker in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 26]: ` Let 's have a glim , ' said Sikes , ` or we shall go breaking our necks , or treading on the dog .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 9]: Look after your legs if you do ! '
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 18]: ` Stand still a moment , and I 'll get you one , ' replied the voice .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 29]: The receding footsteps of the speaker were heard ; and , in another minute , the form of Mr. John Dawkins , otherwise the Artful Dodger , appeared .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 18]: He bore in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft stick .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 37]: The young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of recognition upon Oliver than a humourous grin ; but , turning away , beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 36]: They crossed an empty kitchen ; and , opening the door of a low earthy-smelling room , which seemed to have been built in a small back-yard , were received with a shout of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 10]: ` Oh , my wig , my wig ! '
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 18]: cried Master Charles Bates , from whose lungs the laughter had proceeded : ` here he is !
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 8]: oh , cry , here he is !
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 8]: Oh , Fagin , look at him !
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 7]: Fagin , do look at him !
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 19]: I ca n't bear it ; it is such a jolly game , I cant ' bear it .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 12]: Hold me , somebody , while I laugh it out . '
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 30]: With this irrepressible ebullition of mirth , Master Bates laid himself flat on the floor : and kicked convulsively for five minutes , in an ectasy of facetious joy .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 48]: Then jumping to his feet , he snatched the cleft stick from the Dodger ; and , advancing to Oliver , viewed him round and round ; while the Jew , taking off his nightcap , made a great number of low bows to the bewildered boy .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 33]: The Artful , meantime , who was of a rather saturnine disposition , and seldom gave way to merriment when it interfered with business , rifled Oliver 's pockets with steady assiduity .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 9]: ` Look at his togs , Fagin ! '
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 20]: said Charley , putting the light so close to his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 6]: ` Look at his togs !
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 9]: Superfine cloth , and the heavy swell cut !
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 9]: Oh , my eye , what a game !
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 6]: And his books , too !
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 8]: Nothing but a gentleman , Fagin ! '
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 22]: ` Delighted to see you looking so well , my dear , ' said the Jew , bowing with mock humility .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 21]: ` The Artful shall give you another suit , my dear , for fear you should spoil that Sunday one .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 15]: Why did n't you write , my dear , and say you were coming ?
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 10]: We 'd have got something warm for supper . '
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 48]: At his , Master Bates roared again : so loud , that Fagin himself relaxed , and even the Dodger smiled ; but as the Artful drew forth the five-pound note at that instant , it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery awakened his merriment .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 8]: ` Hallo , what 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 12]: inquired Sikes , stepping forward as the Jew seized the note .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 8]: ` That 's mine , Fagin . '
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 13]: ` No , no , my dear , ' said the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 7]: ` Mine , Bill , mine .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 7]: You shall have the books . '
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 8]: ` If that ai n't mine ! '
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 30]: said Bill Sikes , putting on his hat with a determined air ; ` mine and Nancy 's that is ; I 'll take the boy back again . '
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 4]: The Jew started .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 26]: Oliver started too , though from a very different cause ; for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being taken back .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 3]: ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 7]: Hand over , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 3]: said Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 17]: ` This is hardly fair , Bill ; hardly fair , is it , Nancy ? '
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 4]: inquired the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 19]: ` Fair , or not fair , ' retorted Sikes , ` hand over , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 36]: Do you think Nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time but to spend it in scouting arter , and kidnapping , every young boy as gets grabbed through you ?
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 14]: Give it here , you avaricious old skeleton , give it here ! '
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 41]: With this gentle remonstrance , Mr. Sikes plucked the note from between the Jew 's finger and thumb ; and looking the old man coolly in the face , folded it up small , and tied it in his neckerchief .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 22]: ` That 's for our share of the trouble , ' said Sikes ; ` and not half enough , neither .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 13]: You may keep the books , if you 're fond of reading .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 9]: If you ai n't , sell 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 40]: ` They 're very pretty , ' said Charley Bates : who , with sundry grimaces , had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question ; ` beautiful writing , is n't is , Oliver ? '
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 38]: At sight of the dismayed look with which Oliver regarded his tormentors , Master Bates , who was blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous , fell into another ectasy , more boisterous than the first .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 46]: ` They belong to the old gentleman , ' said Oliver , wringing his hands ; ` to the good , kind , old gentleman who took me into his house , and had me nursed , when I was near dying of the fever .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 15]: Oh , pray send them back ; send him back the books and money .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 16]: Keep me here all my life long ; but pray , pray send them back .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 27]: He 'll think I stole them ; the old lady : all of them who were so kind to me : will think I stole them .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 14]: Oh , do have mercy upon me , and send them back ! '
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 36]: With these words , which were uttered with all the energy of passionate grief , Oliver fell upon his knees at the Jew 's feet ; and beat his hands together , in perfect desperation .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 24]: ` The boy 's right , ' remarked Fagin , looking covertly round , and knitting his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 19]: ` You 're right , Oliver , you 're right ; they WILL think you have stolen 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 3]: ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 24]: chuckled the Jew , rubbing his hands , ` it could n't have happened better , if we had chosen our time ! '
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 32]: ` Of course it could n't , ' replied Sikes ; ' I know 'd that , directly I see him coming through Clerkenwell , with the books under his arm .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 6]: It 's all right enough .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 39]: They 're soft-hearted psalm-singers , or they would n't have taken him in at all ; and they 'll ask no questions after him , fear they should be obliged to prosecute , and so get him lagged .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 6]: He 's safe enough . '
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 65]: Oliver had looked from one to the other , while these words were being spoken , as if he were bewildered , and could scarecely understand what passed ; but when Bill Sikes concluded , he jumped suddenly to his feet , and tore wildly from the room : uttering shrieks for help , which made the bare old house echo to the roof .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 9]: ` Keep back the dog , Bill ! '
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 24]: cried Nancy , springing before the door , and closing it , as the Jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 15]: ` Keep back the dog ; he 'll tear the boy to pieces . '
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 6]: ` Serve him right ! '
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 13]: cried Sikes , struggling to disengage himself from the girl 's grasp .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 18]: ` Stand off from me , or I 'll split your head against the wall . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 46]: I do n't care for that , Bill , I do n't care for that , ' screamed the girl , struggling violently with the man , ` the child sha n't be torn down by the dog , unless you kill me first . '
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 6]: ` Sha n't he ! '
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 7]: said Sikes , setting his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 15]: ` I 'll soon do that , if you do n't keep off . '
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 30]: The housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the room , just as the Jew and the two boys returned , dragging Oliver among them .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 8]: ` What 's the matter here ! '
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 6]: said Fagin , looking round .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 16]: ` The girl 's gone mad , I think , ' replied Sikes , savagely .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 33]: ` No , she has n't , ' said Nancy , pale and breathless from the scuffle ; ` no , she has n't , Fagin ; do n't think it . '
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 9]: ` Then keep quiet , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 9]: said the Jew , with a threatening look .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 19]: ` No , I wo n't do that , neither , ' replied Nancy , speaking very loud .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 3]: ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 8]: What do you think of that ? '
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 42]: Mr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs of that particular species of humanity to which Nancy belonged , to feel tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any conversation with her , at present .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 16]: With the view of diverting the attention of the company , he turned to Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 15]: ` So you wanted to get away , my dear , did you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 24]: said the Jew , taking up a jagged and knotted club which law in a corner of the fireplace ; ` eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 5]: Oliver made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 12]: But he watched the Jew 's motions , and breathed quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 15]: ` Wanted to get assistance ; called for the police ; did you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 11]: sneered the Jew , catching the boy by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 13]: ` We 'll cure you of that , my young master . '
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 35]: The Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver 's shoulders with the club ; and was raising it for a second , when the girl , rushing forward , wrested it from his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 24]: She flung it into the fire , with a force that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room . '
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 17]: I wo n't stand by and see it done , Fagin , ' cried the girl .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 14]: ` You 've got the boy , and what more would you have ?
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 32]: -- Let him be -- let him be -- or I shall put that mark on some of you , that will bring me to the gallows before my time . '
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 53]: The girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this threat ; and with her lips compressed , and her hands clenched , looked alternately at the Jew and the other robber : her face quite colourless from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 6]: ` Why , Nancy ! '
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 41]: said the Jew , in a soothing tone ; after a pause , during which he and Mr. Sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted manner ; ` you , -- you 're more clever than ever to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 9]: my dear , you are acting beautifully . '
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 5]: ` Am I ! '
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 4]: said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 9]: ` Take care I do n't overdo it .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 29]: You will be the worse for it , Fagin , if I do ; and so I tell you in good time to keep clear of me . '
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 34]: There is something about a roused woman : especially if she add to all her other strong passions , the fierce impulses of recklessness and despair ; which few men like to provoke .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 59]: The Jew saw that it would be hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss Nancy 's rage ; and , shrinking involuntarily back a few paces , cast a glance , half imploring and half cowardly , at Sikes : as if to hint that he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 55]: Mr. Sikes , thus mutely appealed to ; and possibly feeling his personal pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of Miss Nancy to reason ; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and threats , the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the fertility of his invention .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 24]: As they produced no visible effect on the object against whom they were discharged , however , he resorted to more tangible arguments .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 9]: ` What do you mean by this ? '
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 59]: said Sikes ; backing the inquiry with a very common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features : which , if it were heard above , only once out of every fifty thousand times that it is uttered below , would render blindness as common a disorder as measles : ` what do you mean by it ?
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 4]: Burn my body !
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 13]: Do you know who you are , and what you are ? '
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 35]: ` Oh , yes , I know all about it , ' replied the girl , laughing hysterically ; and shaking her head from side to side , with a poor assumption of indifference .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 42]: ` Well , then , keep quiet , ' rejoined Sikes , with a growl like that he was accustomed to use when addressing his dog , ` or I 'll quiet you for a good long time to come . '
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 34]: The girl laughed again : even less composedly than before ; and , darting a hasty look at Sikes , turned her face aside , and bit her lip till the blood came .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 32]: ` You 're a nice one , ' added Sikes , as he surveyed her with a contemptuous air , ` to take up the humane and gen -- teel side !
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 19]: A pretty subject for the child , as you call him , to make a friend of ! '
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 10]: ` God Almighty help me , I am ! '
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 41]: cried the girl passionately ; ` and I wish I had been struck dead in the street , or had changed places with them we passed so near to-night , before I had lent a hand in bringing him here .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 21]: He 's a thief , a liar , a devil , all that 's bad , from this night forth .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 13]: Is n't that enough for the old wretch , without blows ? '
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 47]: ` Come , come , Sikes , ' said the Jew appealing to him in a remonstratory tone , and motioning towards the boys , who were eagerly attentive to all that passed ; ` we must have civil words ; civil words , Bill . '
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 5]: ` Civil words ! '
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 11]: cried the girl , whose passion was frightful to see .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 7]: ` Civil words , you villain !
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 8]: Yes , you deserve 'em from me .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 17]: I thieved for you when I was a child not half as old as this ! '
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 5]: pointing to Oliver . '
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 19]: I have been in the same trade , and in the same service , for twelve years since .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 6]: Do n't you know it ?
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 3]: Speak out !
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 7]: Do n't you know it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 29]: ` Well , well , ' replied the Jew , with an attempt at pacification ; ` and , if you have , it 's your living ! '
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 7]: ` Aye , it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 19]: returned the girl ; not speaking , but pouring out the words in one continuous and vehement scream .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 52]: ` It is my living ; and the cold , wet , dirty streets are my home ; and you 're the wretch that drove me to them long ago , and that 'll keep me there , day and night , day and night , till I die ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 8]: I shall do you a mischief ! '
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 23]: interposed the Jew , goaded by these reproaches ; ' a mischief worse than that , if you say much more ! '
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 65]: The girl said nothing more ; but , tearing her hair and dress in a transport of passion , made such a rush at the Jew as would probably have left signal marks of her revenge upon him , had not her wrists been seized by Sikes at the right moment ; upon which , she made a few ineffectual struggles , and fainted .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 18]: ` She 's all right now , ' said Sikes , laying her down in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 18]: ` She 's uncommon strong in the arms , when she 's up in this way . '
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 52]: The Jew wiped his forehead : and smiled , as if it were a relief to have the disturbance over ; but neither he , nor Sikes , nor the dog , nor the boys , seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance incidental to business .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 41]: ` It 's the worst of having to do with women , ' said the Jew , replacing his club ; ` but they 're clever , and we ca n't get on , in our line , without 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 9]: Charley , show Oliver to bed . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 18]: I suppose he 'd better not wear his best clothes tomorrow , Fagin , had he ? '
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 4]: inquired Charley Bates .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 19]: ` Certainly not , ' replied the Jew , reciprocating the grin with which Charley put the question .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 101]: Master Bates , apparently much delighted with his commission , took the cleft stick : and led Oliver into an adjacent kitchen , where there were two or three of the beds on which he had slept before ; and here , with many uncontrollable bursts of laughter , he produced the identical old suit of clothes which Oliver had so much congratulated himself upon leaving off at Mr. Brownlow 's ; and the accidental display of which , to Fagin , by the Jew who purchased them , had been the very first clue received , of his whereabout .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 24]: ` Put off the smart ones , ' said Charley , ` and I 'll give 'em to Fagin to take care of .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 6]: What fun it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 5]: Poor Oliver unwillingly complied .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 29]: Master Bates rolling up the new clothes under his arm , departed from the room , leaving Oliver in the dark , and locking the door behind him .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 54]: The noise of Charley 's laughter , and the voice of Miss Betsy , who opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend , and perform other feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery , might have kept many people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which Oliver was placed .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 14]: But he was sick and weary ; and he soon fell sound asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 60]: CHAPTER XVII OLIVER 'S DESTINY CONTINUING UNPROPITIOUS , BRINGS A GREAT MAN TO LONDON TO INJURE HIS REPUTATION It is the custom on the stage , in all good murderous melodramas , to present the tragic and the comic scenes , in as regular alternation , as the layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 33]: The hero sinks upon his straw bed , weighed down by fetters and misfortunes ; in the next scene , his faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience with a comic song .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 113]: We behold , with throbbing bosoms , the heroine in the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron : her virtue and her life alike in danger , drawing forth her dagger to preserve the one at the cost of the other ; and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest pitch , a whistle is heard , and we are straightway transported to the great hall of the castle ; where a grey-headed seneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body of vassals , who are free of all sorts of places , from church vaults to palaces , and roam about in company , carolling perpetually .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 19]: Such changes appear absurd ; but they are not so unnatural as they would seem at first sight .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 45]: The transitions in real life from well-spread boards to death-beds , and from mourning-weeds to holiday garments , are not a whit less startling ; only , there , we are busy actors , instead of passive lookers-on , which makes a vast difference .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 42]: The actors in the mimic life of the theatre , are blind to violent transitions and abrupt impulses of passion or feeling , which , presented before the eyes of mere spectators , are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 83]: As sudden shiftings of the scene , and rapid changes of time and place , are not only sanctioned in books by long usage , but are by many considered as the great art of authorship : an author 's skill in his craft being , by such critics , chiefly estimated with relation to the dilemmas in which he leaves his characters at the end of every chapter : this brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 62]: If so , let it be considered a delicate intimation on the part of the historian that he is going back to the town in which Oliver Twist was born ; the reader taking it for granted that there are good and substantial reasons for making the journey , or he would not be invited to proceed upon such an expedition .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 24]: Mr. Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse-gate , and walked with portly carriage and commanding steps , up the High Street .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 36]: He was in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood ; his cocked hat and coat were dazzling in the morning sun ; he clutched his cane with the vigorous tenacity of health and power .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 17]: Mr. Bumble always carried his head high ; but this morning it was higher than usual .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 36]: There was an abstraction in his eye , an elevation in his air , which might have warned an observant stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadle 's mind , too great for utterance .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 24]: Mr. Bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and others who spoke to him , deferentially , as he passed along .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 36]: He merely returned their salutations with a wave of his hand , and relaxed not in his dignified pace , until he reached the farm where Mrs. Mann tended the infant paupers with parochial care .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 6]: ` Drat that beadle ! '
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 12]: said Mrs. Mann , hearing the well-known shaking at the garden-gate .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 13]: ` If it is n't him at this time in the morning !
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 12]: Lauk , Mr. Bumble , only think of its being you !
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 13]: Well , dear me , it IS a pleasure , this is !
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 10]: Come into the parlour , sir , please . '
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 41]: The first sentence was addressed to Susan ; and the exclamations of delight were uttered to Mr. Bumble : as the good lady unlocked the garden-gate : and showed him , with great attention and respect , into the house .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 47]: ` Mrs. Mann , ' said Mr. Bumble ; not sitting upon , or dropping himself into a seat , as any common jackanapes would : but letting himself gradually and slowly down into a chair ; ` Mrs. Mann , ma'am , good morning . '
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 31]: ` Well , and good morning to YOU , sir , ' replied Mrs. Mann , with many smiles ; ` and hoping you find yourself well , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 12]: ` So-so , Mrs. Mann , ' replied the beadle . '
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 14]: A porochial life is not a bed of roses , Mrs. Mann . '
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 17]: ` Ah , that it is n't indeed , Mr. Bumble , ' rejoined the lady .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 21]: And all the infant paupers might have chorussed the rejoinder with great propriety , if they had heard it . '
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 46]: A porochial life , ma'am , ' continued Mr. Bumble , striking the table with his cane , ` is a life of worrit , and vexation , and hardihood ; but all public characters , as I may say , must suffer prosecution . '
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 24]: Mrs. Mann , not very well knowing what the beadle meant , raised her hands with a look of sympathy , and sighed .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 9]: You may well sigh , Mrs. Mann ! '
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 4]: said the beadle .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 47]: Finding she had done right , Mrs. Mann sighed again : evidently to the satisfaction of the public character : who , repressing a complacent smile by looking sternly at his cocked hat , said , ` Mrs. Mann , I am going to London . '
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 7]: ` Lauk , Mr. Bumble ! '
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 7]: cried Mrs. Mann , starting back .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 16]: ` To London , ma'am , ' resumed the inflexible beadle , ` by coach .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 8]: I and two paupers , Mrs. Mann !
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 35]: A legal action is a coming on , about a settlement ; and the board has appointed me -- me , Mrs. Mann -- to dispose to the matter before the quarter-sessions at Clerkinwell .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 36]: And I very much question , ' added Mr. Bumble , drawing himself up , ` whether the Clerkinwell Sessions will not find themselves in the wrong box before they have done with me . '
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 18]: you must n't be too hard upon them , sir , ' said Mrs. Mann , coaxingly .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 44]: ` The Clerkinwell Sessions have brought it upon themselves , ma'am , ' replied Mr. Bumble ; ` and if the Clerkinwell Sessions find that they come off rather worse than they expected , the Clerkinwell Sessions have only themselves to thank . '
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 32]: There was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing manner in which Mr. Bumble delivered himself of these words , that Mrs. Mann appeared quite awed by them .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 14]: At length she said , ` You 're going by coach , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 14]: I thought it was always usual to send them paupers in carts . '
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 16]: ` That 's when they 're ill , Mrs. Mann , ' said the beadle .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 21]: ` We put the sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather , to prevent their taking cold . '
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 4]: said Mrs. Mann .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 19]: ` The opposition coach contracts for these two ; and takes them cheap , ' said Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 61]: ` They are both in a very low state , and we find it would come two pound cheaper to move 'em than to bury 'em -- that is , if we can throw 'em upon another parish , which I think we shall be able to do , if they do n't die upon the road to spite us .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 3]: ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 22]: When Mr. Bumble had laughed a little while , his eyes again encountered the cocked hat ; and he became grave .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 24]: ` We are forgetting business , ma'am , ' said the beadle ; ` here is your porochial stipend for the month . ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 25]: Mr. Bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper , from his pocket-book ; and requested a receipt : which Mrs. Mann wrote .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 27]: ` It 's very much blotted , sir , ' said the farmer of infants ; ` but it 's formal enough , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 21]: Thank you , Mr. Bumble , sir , I am very much obliged to you , I 'm sure . '
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 21]: Mr. Bumble nodded , blandly , in acknowledgment of Mrs. Mann 's curtsey ; and inquired how the children were .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 8]: ` Bless their dear little hearts ! '
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 18]: said Mrs. Mann with emotion , ` they 're as well as can be , the dears !
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 11]: Of course , except the two that died last week .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 5]: And little Dick . '
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 9]: ` Is n't that boy no better ? '
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 4]: inquired Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 6]: Mrs. Mann shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 19]: ` He 's a ill-conditioned , wicious , bad-disposed porochial child that , ' said Mr. Bumble angrily .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 6]: ` Where is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 18]: ` I 'll bring him to you in one minute , sir , ' replied Mrs. Mann .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 7]: ` Here , you Dick ! '
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 8]: After some calling , Dick was discovered .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 31]: Having had his face put under the pump , and dried upon Mrs. Mann 's gown , he was led into the awful presence of Mr. Bumble , the beadle .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 19]: The child was pale and thin ; his cheeks were sunken ; and his eyes large and bright .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 33]: The scanty parish dress , the livery of his misery , hung loosely on his feeble body ; and his young limbs had wasted away , like those of an old man .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 34]: Such was the little being who stood trembling beneath Mr. Bumble 's glance ; not daring to lift his eyes from the floor ; and dreading even to hear the beadle 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 14]: ` Ca n't you look at the gentleman , you obstinate boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 4]: said Mrs. Mann .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 14]: The child meekly raised his eyes , and encountered those of Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 12]: ` What 's the matter with you , porochial Dick ? '
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 8]: inquired Mr. Bumble , with well-timed jocularity .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 12]: ` Nothing , sir , ' replied the child faintly . '
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 23]: I should think not , ' said Mrs. Mann , who had of course laughed very much at Mr. Bumble 's humour .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 12]: ` You want for nothing , I 'm sure . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 9]: I should like -- ' faltered the child .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 4]: ` Hey-day ! '
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 21]: interposed Mr. Mann , ' I suppose you 're going to say that you DO want for something , now ?
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 16]: Why , you little wretch -- ' ` Stop , Mrs. Mann , stop ! '
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 13]: said the beadle , raising his hand with a show of authority .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 10]: ` Like what , sir , eh ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 50]: I should like , ' said the child , ` to leave my dear love to poor Oliver Twist ; and to let him know how often I have sat by myself and cried to think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help him .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 88]: And I should like to tell him , ' said the child pressing his small hands together , and speaking with great fervour , ` that I was glad to die when I was very young ; for , perhaps , if I had lived to be a man , and had grown old , my little sister who is in Heaven , might forget me , or be unlike me ; and it would be so much happier if we were both children there together . '
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 36]: Mr. Bumble surveyed the little speaker , from head to foot , with indescribable astonishment ; and , turning to his companion , said , ` They 're all in one story , Mrs. Mann .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 10]: That out-dacious Oliver had demogalized them all ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 25]: I could n't have believed it , sir ' said Mrs Mann , holding up her hands , and looking malignantly at Dick . '
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 10]: I never see such a hardened little wretch ! '
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 8]: ` Take him away , ma'am ! '
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 5]: said Mr. Bumble imperiously .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 13]: ` This must be stated to the board , Mrs. Mann . '
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 16]: I hope the gentleman will understand that it is n't my fault , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 7]: said Mrs. Mann , whimpering pathetically .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 25]: ` They shall understand that , ma'am ; they shall be acquainted with the true state of the case , ' said Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 17]: ` There ; take him away , I ca n't bear the sight on him . '
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 13]: Dick was immediately taken away , and locked up in the coal-cellar .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 14]: Mr. Bumble shortly afterwards took himself off , to prepare for his journey .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 66]: At six o'clock next morning , Mr. Bumble : having exchanged his cocked hat for a round one , and encased his person in a blue great-coat with a cape to it : took his place on the outside of the coach , accompanied by the criminals whose settlement was disputed ; with whom , in due course of time , he arrived in London .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 65]: He experienced no other crosses on the way , than those which originated in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers , who persisted in shivering , and complaining of the cold , in a manner which , Mr. Bumble declared , caused his teeth to chatter in his head , and made him feel quite uncomfortable ; although he had a great-coat on .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 38]: Having disposed of these evil-minded persons for the night , Mr. Bumble sat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped ; and took a temperate dinner of steaks , oyster sauce , and porter .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 40]: Putting a glass of hot gin-and-water on the chimney-piece , he drew his chair to the fire ; and , with sundry moral reflections on the too-prevalent sin of discontent and complaining , composed himself to read the paper .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 17]: The very first paragraph upon which Mr. Bumble 's eye rested , was the following advertisement .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 40]: ` FIVE GUINEAS REWARD ` Whereas a young boy , named Oliver Twist , absconded , or was enticed , on Thursday evening last , from his home , at Pentonville ; and has not since been heard of .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 51]: The above reward will be paid to any person who will give such information as will lead to the discovery of the said Oliver Twist , or tend to throw any light upon his previous history , in which the advertiser is , for many reasons , warmly interested . '
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 30]: And then followed a full description of Oliver 's dress , person , appearance , and disappearance : with the name and address of Mr. Brownlow at full length .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 48]: Mr. Bumble opened his eyes ; read the advertisement , slowly and carefully , three several times ; and in something more than five minutes was on his way to Pentonville : having actually , in his excitement , left the glass of hot gin-and-water , untasted .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 8]: ` Is Mr. Brownlow at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 11]: inquired Mr. Bumble of the girl who opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 28]: To this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon , but rather evasive reply of ' I do n't know ; where do you come from ? '
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 37]: Mr. Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver 's name , in explanation of his errand , than Mrs. Bedwin , who had been listening at the parlour door , hastened into the passage in a breathless state .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 22]: ` Come in , come in , ' said the old lady : ' I knew we should hear of him .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 3]: Poor dear !
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 5]: I knew we should !
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 6]: I was certain of it .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 4]: Bless his heart !
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 7]: I said so all along . '
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 26]: Having heard this , the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour again ; and seating herself on a sofa , burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 33]: The girl , who was not quite so susceptible , had run upstairs meanwhile ; and now returned with a request that Mr. Bumble would follow her immediately : which he did .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 26]: He was shown into the little back study , where sat Mr. Brownlow and his friend Mr. Grimwig , with decanters and glasses before them .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 14]: The latter gentleman at once burst into the exclamation : ' A beadle .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 12]: A parish beadle , or I 'll eat my head . '
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 13]: ` Pray do n't interrupt just now , ' said Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 9]: ` Take a seat , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 17]: Mr. Bumble sat himself down ; quite confounded by the oddity of Mr. Grimwig 's manner .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 43]: Mr. Brownlow moved the lamp , so as to obtain an uninterrupted view of the beadle 's countenance ; and said , with a little impatience , ` Now , sir , you come in consequence of having seen the advertisement ? '
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 10]: ` Yes , sir , ' said Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 12]: ` And you ARE a beadle , are you not ? '
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 5]: inquired Mr. Grimwig . '
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 14]: I am a porochial beadle , gentlemen , ' rejoined Mr. Bumble proudly .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 19]: ` Of course , ' observed Mr. Grimwig aside to his friend , ' I knew he was .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 6]: A beadle all over ! '
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 28]: Mr. Brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend , and resumed : ` Do you know where this poor boy is now ? '
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 11]: ` No more than nobody , ' replied Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 11]: ` Well , what DO you know of him ? '
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 5]: inquired the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 14]: ` Speak out , my friend , if you have anything to say .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 8]: What DO you know of him ? '
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 16]: ` You do n't happen to know any good of him , do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 16]: said Mr. Grimwig , caustically ; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble 's features .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 17]: Mr. Bumble , catching at the inquiry very quickly , shook his head with portentous solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 5]: ` You see ? '
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 10]: said Mr. Grimwig , looking triumphantly at Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 29]: Mr. Brownlow looked apprehensively at Mr. Bumble 's pursed-up countenance ; and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding Oliver , in as few words as possible .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 36]: Mr. Bumble put down his hat ; unbuttoned his coat ; folded his arms ; inclined his head in a retrospective manner ; and , after a few moments ' reflection , commenced his story .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 47]: It would be tedious if given in the beadle 's words : occupying , as it did , some twenty minutes in the telling ; but the sum and substance of it was , that Oliver was a foundling , born of low and vicious parents .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 20]: That he had , from his birth , displayed no better qualities than treachery , ingratitude , and malice .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 38]: That he had terminated his brief career in the place of his birth , by making a sanguinary and cowardly attack on an unoffending lad , and running away in the night-time from his master 's house .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 26]: In proof of his really being the person he represented himself , Mr. Bumble laid upon the table the papers he had brought to town .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 14]: Folding his arms again , he then awaited Mr. Brownlow 's observations . '
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 21]: I fear it is all too true , ' said the old gentleman sorrowfully , after looking over the papers .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 30]: ` This is not much for your intelligence ; but I would gladly have given you treble the money , if it had been favourable to the boy . '
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 35]: It is not improbable that if Mr. Bumble had been possessed of this information at an earlier period of the interview , he might have imparted a very different colouring to his little history .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 27]: It was too late to do it now , however ; so he shook his head gravely , and , pocketing the five guineas , withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 32]: Mr. Brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes ; evidently so much disturbed by the beadle 's tale , that even Mr. Grimwig forbore to vex him further .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 11]: At length he stopped , and rang the bell violently .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 25]: ` Mrs. Bedwin , ' said Mr. Brownlow , when the housekeeper appeared ; ` that boy , Oliver , is an imposter . '
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 8]: ` It ca n't be , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 13]: It can not be , ' said the old lady energetically . '
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 12]: I tell you he is , ' retorted the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 10]: ` What do you mean by ca n't be ?
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 28]: We have just heard a full account of him from his birth ; and he has been a thorough-paced little villain , all his life . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 16]: I never will believe it , sir , ' replied the old lady , firmly .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 4]: ` Never ! '
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 20]: ` You old women never believe anything but quack-doctors , and lying story-books , ' growled Mr. Grimwig . '
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 6]: I knew it all along .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 26]: Why did n't you take my advise in the beginning ; you would if he had n't had a fever , I suppose , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 8]: He was interesting , was n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 2]: Interesting !
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 3]: Bah ! '
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 10]: And Mr. Grimwig poked the fire with a flourish .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 21]: ` He was a dear , grateful , gentle child , sir , ' retorted Mrs. Bedwin , indignantly . '
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 31]: I know what children are , sir ; and have done these forty years ; and people who ca n't say the same , should n't say anything about them .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 6]: That 's my opinion ! '
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 14]: This was a hard hit at Mr. Grimwig , who was a bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 36]: As it extorted nothing from that gentleman but a smile , the old lady tossed her head , and smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech , when she was stopped by Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 4]: ` Silence ! '
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 14]: said the old gentleman , feigning an anger he was far from feeling .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 11]: ` Never let me hear the boy 's name again .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 7]: I rang to tell you that .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 2]: Never .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 8]: Never , on any pretence , mind !
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 9]: You may leave the room , Mrs. Bedwin .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 2]: Remember !
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 6]: I am in earnest . '
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 11]: There were sad hearts at Mr. Brownlow 's that night .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 37]: Oliver 's heart sank within him , when he thought of his good friends ; it was well for him that he could not know what they had heard , or it might have broken outright .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 104]: CHAPTER XVIII HOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS REPUTABLE FRIENDS About noon next day , when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone out to pursue their customary avocations , Mr. Fagin took the opportunity of reading Oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude ; of which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty , to no ordinary extent , in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious friends ; and , still more , in endeavouring to escape from them after so much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 89]: Mr. Fagin laid great stress on the fact of his having taken Oliver in , and cherished him , when , without his timely aid , he might have perished with hunger ; and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young lad whom , in his philanthropy , he had succoured under parallel circumstances , but who , proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing a desire to communicate with the police , had unfortunately come to be hanged at the Old Bailey one morning .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 77]: Mr. Fagin did not seek to conceal his share in the catastrophe , but lamented with tears in his eyes that the wrong-headed and treacherous behaviour of the young person in question , had rendered it necessary that he should become the victim of certain evidence for the crown : which , if it were not precisely true , was indispensably necessary for the safety of him -LRB- Mr. Fagin -RRB- and a few select friends .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 44]: Mr. Fagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging ; and , with great friendliness and politeness of manner , expressed his anxious hopes that he might never be obliged to submit Oliver Twist to that unpleasant operation .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 26]: Little Oliver 's blood ran cold , as he listened to the Jew 's words , and imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 92]: That it was possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the guilty when they were in accidental companionship , he knew already ; and that deeply-laid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or over-communicative persons , had been really devised and carried out by the Jew on more occasions than one , he thought by no means unlikely , when he recollected the general nature of the altercations between that gentleman and Mr. Sikes : which seemed to bear reference to some foregone conspiracy of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 34]: As he glanced timidly up , and met the Jew 's searching look , he felt that his pale face and trembling limbs were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 38]: The Jew , smiling hideously , patted Oliver on the head , and said , that if he kept himself quiet , and applied himself to business , he saw they would be very good friends yet .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 26]: Then , taking his hat , and covering himself with an old patched great-coat , he went out , and locked the room-door behind him .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 40]: And so Oliver remained all that day , and for the greater part of many subsequent days , seeing nobody , between early morning and midnight , and left during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 27]: Which , never failing to revert to his kind friends , and the opinion they must long ago have formed of him , were sad indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 27]: After the lapse of a week or so , the Jew left the room-door unlocked ; and he was at liberty to wander about the house .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 7]: It was a very dirty place .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 38]: The rooms upstairs had great high wooden chimney-pieces and large doors , with panelled walls and cornices to the ceiling ; which , although they were black with neglect and dust , were ornamented in various ways .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 44]: From all of these tokens Oliver concluded that a long time ago , before the old Jew was born , it had belonged to better people , and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome : dismal and dreary as it looked now .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 41]: Spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings ; and sometimes , when Oliver walked softly into a room , the mice would scamper across the floor , and run back terrified to their holes .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 76]: With these exceptions , there was neither sight nor sound of any living thing ; and often , when it grew dark , and he was tired of wandering from room to room , he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the street-door , to be as near living people as he could ; and would remain there , listening and counting the hours , until the Jew or the boys returned .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 55]: In all the rooms , the mouldering shutters were fast closed : the bars which held them were screwed tight into the wood ; the only light which was admitted , stealing its way through round holes at the top : which made the rooms more gloomy , and filled them with strange shadows .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 54]: There was a back-garret window with rusty bars outside , which had no shutter ; and out of this , Oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for hours together ; but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused and crowded mass of housetops , blackened chimneys , and gable-ends .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 102]: Sometimes , indeed , a grizzly head might be seen , peering over the parapet-wall of a distant house ; but it was quickly withdrawn again ; and as the window of Oliver 's observatory was nailed down , and dimmed with the rain and smoke of years , it was as much as he could do to make out the forms of the different objects beyond , without making any attempt to be seen or heard , -- which he had as much chance of being , as if he had lived inside the ball of St. Paul 's Cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 72]: One afternoon , the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged out that evening , the first-named young gentleman took it into his head to evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person -LRB- to do him justice , this was by no means an habitual weakness with him -RRB- ; and , with this end and aim , he condescendingly commanded Oliver to assist him in his toilet , straightway .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 49]: Oliver was but too glad to make himself useful ; too happy to have some faces , however bad , to look upon ; too desirous to conciliate those about him when he could honestly do so ; to throw any objection in the way of this proposal .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 50]: So he at once expressed his readiness ; and , kneeling on the floor , while the Dodger sat upon the table so that he could take his foot in his laps , he applied himself to a process which Mr. Dawkins designated as ` japanning his trotter-cases . '
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 14]: The phrase , rendered into plain English , signifieth , cleaning his boots .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 125]: Whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy attitude smoking a pipe , swinging one leg carelessly to and fro , and having his boots cleaned all the time , without even the past trouble of having taken them off , or the prospective misery of putting them on , to disturb his reflections ; or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco that soothed the feelings of the Dodger , or the mildness of the beer that mollified his thoughts ; he was evidently tinctured , for the nonce , with a spice of romance and enthusiasm , foreign to his general nature .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 54]: He looked down on Oliver , with a thoughtful countenance , for a brief space ; and then , raising his head , and heaving a gentle sign , said , half in abstraction , and half to Master Bates : ` What a pity it is he is n't a prig ! '
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 17]: said Master Charles Bates ; ` he do n't know what 's good for him . '
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 15]: The Dodger sighed again , and resumed his pipe : as did Charley Bates .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 12]: They both smoked , for some seconds , in silence . '
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 13]: I suppose you do n't even know what a prig is ? '
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 6]: said the Dodger mournfully . '
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 13]: I think I know that , ' replied Oliver , looking up .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 16]: ` It 's a the -- ; you 're one , are you not ? '
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 7]: inquired Oliver , checking himself . '
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 8]: I am , ' replied the Doger .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 10]: ` I 'd scorn to be anything else . '
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 38]: Mr. Dawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock , after delivering this sentiment , and looked at Master Bates , as if to denote that he would feel obliged by his saying anything to the contrary . '
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 8]: I am , ' repeated the Dodger .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 5]: ` So 's Charley .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 4]: So 's Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 4]: So 's Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 4]: So 's Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 4]: So 's Bet .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 10]: So we all are , down to the dog .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 11]: And he 's the downiest one of the lot ! '
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 13]: ` And the least given to peaching , ' added Charley Bates .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 44]: ` He would n't so much as bark in a witness-box , for fear of committing himself ; no , not if you tied him up in one , and left him there without wittles for a fortnight , ' said the Dodger .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 11]: ` Not a bit of it , ' observed Charley .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 7]: ` He 's a rum dog .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 20]: Do n't he look fierce at any strange cove that laughs or sings when he 's in company ! '
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 4]: pursued the Dodger .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 15]: ` Wo n't he growl at all , when he hears a fiddle playing !
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 14]: And do n't he hate other dogs as ai n't of his breed !
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 5]: Oh , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 11]: ` He 's an out-and-out Christian , ' said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 65]: This was merely intended as a tribute to the animal 's abilities , but it was an appropriate remark in another sense , if Master Bates had only known it ; for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen , claiming to be out-and-out Christians , between whom , and Mr. Sikes ' dog , there exist strong and singular points of resemblance .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 32]: ` Well , well , ' said the Dodger , recurring to the point from which they had strayed : with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced all his proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 14]: ` This has n't go anything to do with young Green here . '
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 10]: ` No more it has , ' said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 13]: ` Why do n't you put yourself under Fagin , Oliver ? '
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 11]: ` And make your fortun ' out of hand ? '
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 8]: added the Dodger , with a grin .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 45]: ` And so be able to retire on your property , and do the gen-teel : as I mean to , in the very next leap-year but four that ever comes , and the forty-second Tuesday in Trinity-week , ' said Charley Bates . '
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 21]: I do n't like it , ' rejoined Oliver , timidly ; ' I wish they would let me go .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 9]: I -- I -- would rather go . '
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 8]: ` And Fagin would RATHER not ! '
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 3]: rejoined Charley .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 30]: Oliver knew this too well ; but thinking it might be dangerous to express his feelings more openly , he only sighed , and went on with his boot-cleaning .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 4]: ` Go ! '
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 4]: exclaimed the Dodger .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 9]: ` Why , where 's your spirit ? '
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 10]: Do n't you take any pride out of yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 11]: Would you go and be dependent on your friends ? '
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 7]: ` Oh , blow that ! '
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 32]: said Master Bates : drawing two or three silk handkerchiefs from his pocket , and tossing them into a cupboard , ` that 's too mean ; that is . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 18]: I could n't do it , ' said the Dodger , with an air of haughty disgust .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 29]: ` You can leave your friends , though , ' said Oliver with a half smile ; ` and let them be punished for what you did . '
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 61]: ` That , ' rejoined the Dodger , with a wave of his pipe , ` That was all out of consideration for Fagin , 'cause the traps know that we work together , and he might have got into trouble if we had n't made our lucky ; that was the move , was n't it , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 63]: Master Bates nodded assent , and would have spoken , but the recollection of Oliver 's flight came so suddenly upon him , that the smoke he was inhaling got entagled with a laugh , and went up into his head , and down into his throat : and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping , about five minutes long .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 5]: ` Look here ! '
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 13]: said the Dodger , drawing forth a handful of shillings and halfpence .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 7]: ` Here 's a jolly life !
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 9]: What 's the odds where it comes from ?
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 15]: Here , catch hold ; there 's plenty more where they were took from .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 8]: You wo n't , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 7]: Oh , you precious flat ! '
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 12]: ` It 's naughty , ai n't it , Oliver ? '
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 4]: inquired Charley Bates .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 14]: ` He 'll come to be scragged , wo n't he ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 12]: I do n't know what that means , ' replied Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 13]: ` Something in this way , old feller , ' said Charly .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 60]: As he said it , Master Bates caught up an end of his neckerchief ; and , holding it erect in the air , dropped his head on his shoulder , and jerked a curious sound through his teeth ; thereby indicating , by a lively pantomimic representation , that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 11]: ` That 's what it means , ' said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 8]: ` Look how he stares , Jack !
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 27]: I never did see such prime company as that ` ere boy ; he 'll be the death of me , I know he will . '
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 18]: Master Charley Bates , having laughed heartily again , resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 25]: ` You 've been brought up bad , ' said the Dodger , surveying his boots with much satisfaction when Oliver had polished them .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 24]: ` Fagin will make something of you , though , or you 'll be the first he ever had that turned out unprofitable .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 31]: You 'd better begin at once ; for you 'll come to the trade long before you think of it ; and you 're only losing time , Oliver . '
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 79]: Master Bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his own : which , being exhausted , he and his friend Mr. Dawkins launched into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the life they led , interspersed with a variety of hints to Oliver that the best thing he could do , would be to secure Fagin 's favour without more delay , by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 49]: ` And always put this in your pipe , Nolly , ' said the Dodger , as the Jew was heard unlocking the door above , ` if you do n't take fogels and tickers -- ' ` What 's the good of talking in that way ? '
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 14]: interposed Master Bates ; ` he do n't know what you mean . '
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 89]: ` If you do n't take pocket-handkechers and watches , ' said the Dodger , reducing his conversation to the level of Oliver 's capacity , ` some other cove will ; so that the coves that lose 'em will be all the worse , and you 'll be all the worse , too , and nobody half a ha ` p ` orth the better , except the chaps wot gets them -- and you 've just as good a right to them as they have . '
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 10]: ` To be sure , to be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 11]: said the Jew , who had entered unseen by Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 22]: ` It all lies in a nutshell my dear ; in a nutshell , take the Dodger 's word for it .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 9]: He understands the catechism of his trade . '
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 30]: The old man rubbed his hands gleefully together , as he corroborated the Dodger 's reasoning in these terms ; and chuckled with delight at his pupil 's proficiency .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 63]: The conversation proceeded no farther at this time , for the Jew had returned home accompanied by Miss Betsy , and a gentleman whom Oliver had never seen before , but who was accosted by the Dodger as Tom Chitling ; and who , having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few gallantries with the lady , now made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 51]: Mr. Chitling was older in years than the Dodger : having perhaps numbered eighteen winters ; but there was a degree of deference in his deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius and professional aquirements .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 29]: He had small twinkling eyes , and a pock-marked face ; wore a fur cap , a dark corduroy jacket , greasy fustian trousers , and an apron .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 62]: His wardrobe was , in truth , rather out of repair ; but he excused himself to the company by stating that his ` time ' was only out an hour before ; and that , in consequence of having worn the regimentals for six weeks past , he had not been able to bestow any attention on his private clothes .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 39]: Mr. Chitling added , with strong marks of irritation , that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder was infernal unconstitutional , for it burnt holes in them , and there was no remedy against the County .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 24]: The same remark he considered to apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair : which he held to be decidedly unlawful .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 44]: Mr. Chitling wound up his observations by stating that he had not touched a drop of anything for forty-two moral long hard-working days ; and that he ` wished he might be busted if he war n't as dry as a lime-basket . '
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 14]: ` Where do you think the gentleman has come from , Oliver ? '
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 21]: inquired the Jew , with a grin , as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the table .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 15]: ` I -- I -- do n't know , sir , ' replied Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 6]: ` Who 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 12]: inquired Tom Chitling , casting a contemptuous look at Oliver . '
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 14]: A young friend of mine , my dear , ' replied the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 21]: ` He 's in luck , then , ' said the young man , with a meaning look at Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 29]: ` Never mind where I came from , young ` un ; you 'll find your way there , soon enough , I 'll bet a crown ! '
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 8]: At this sally , the boys laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 21]: After some more jokes on the same subject , they exchanged a few short whispers with Fagin ; and withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 45]: After some words apart between the last comer and Fagin , they drew their chairs towards the fire ; and the Jew , telling Oliver to come and sit by him , led the conversation to the topics most calculated to interest his hearers .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 30]: These were , the great advantages of the trade , the proficiency of the Dodger , the amiability of Charley Bates , and the liberality of the Jew himself .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 31]: At length these subjects displayed signs of being thoroughly exhausted ; and Mr. Chitling did the same : for the house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 13]: Miss Betsy accordingly withdrew ; and left the party to their repose .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 47]: From this day , Oliver was seldom left alone ; but was placed in almost constant communication with the two boys , who played the old game with the Jew every day : whether for their own improvement or Oliver 's , Mr. Fagin best knew .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 53]: At other times the old man would tell them stories of robberies he had committed in his younger days : mixed up with so much that was droll and curious , that Oliver could not help laughing heartily , and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better feelings .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 14]: In short , the wily old Jew had the boy in his toils .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 52]: Having prepared his mind , by solitude and gloom , to prefer any society to the companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place , he was now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would blacken it , and change its hue for ever .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 60]: CHAPTER XIX IN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ON It was a chill , damp , windy night , when the Jew : buttoning his great-coat tight round his shrivelled body , and pulling the collar up over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face : emerged from his den .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 45]: He paused on the step as the door was locked and chained behind him ; and having listened while the boys made all secure , and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible , slunk down the street as quickly as he could .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 16]: The house to which Oliver had been conveyed , was in the neighborhood of Whitechapel .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 33]: The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the street ; and , glancing suspiciously round , crossed the road , and struck off in the direction of the Spitalfields .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 33]: The mud lay thick upon the stones , and a black mist hung over the streets ; the rain fell sluggishly down , and everything felt cold and clammy to the touch .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 18]: It seemed just the night when it befitted such a being as the Jew to be abroad .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 53]: As he glided stealthily along , creeping beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways , the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome reptile , engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved : crawling forth , by night , in search of some rich offal for a meal .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 50]: He kept on his course , through many winding and narrow ways , until he reached Bethnal Green ; then , turning suddenly off to the left , he soon became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in that close and densely-populated quarter .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 32]: The Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be at all bewildered , either by the darkness of the night , or the intricacies of the way .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 26]: He hurried through several alleys and streets , and at length turned into one , lighted only by a single lamp at the farther end .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 30]: At the door of a house in this street , he knocked ; having exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it , he walked upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 22]: A dog growled as he touched the handle of a room-door ; and a man 's voice demanded who was there .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 19]: ` Only me , Bill ; only me , my dear , ' said the Jew looking in .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 11]: ` Bring in your body then , ' said Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 8]: ` Lie down , you stupid brute !
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 15]: Do n't you know the devil when he 's got a great-coat on ? '
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 67]: Apparently , the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin 's outer garment ; for as the Jew unbuttoned it , and threw it over the back of a chair , he retired to the corner from which he had risen : wagging his tail as he went , to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his nature to be .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 3]: said Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 11]: ` Well , my dear , ' replied the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 4]: -- ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 3]: Nancy . '
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 38]: The latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to imply a doubt of its reception ; for Mr. Fagin and his young friend had not met , since she had interfered in behalf of Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 21]: All doubts upon the subject , if he had any , were speedily removed by the young lady 's behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 37]: She took her feet off the fender , pushed back her chair , and bade Fagin draw up his , without saying more about it : for it was a cold night , and no mistake .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 23]: ` It is cold , Nancy dear , ' said the Jew , as he warmed his skinny hands over the fire .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 19]: ` It seems to go right through one , ' added the old man , touching his side .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 21]: ` It must be a piercer , if it finds its way through your heart , ' said Mr. Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 9]: ` Give him something to drink , Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 7]: Burn my body , make haste !
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 31]: It 's enough to turn a man ill , to see his lean old carcase shivering in that way , like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave . '
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 34]: Nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard , in which there were many : which , to judge from the diversity of their appearance , were filled with several kinds of liquids .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 15]: Sikes pouring out a glass of brandy , bade the Jew drink it off .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 27]: ` Quite enough , quite , thankye , Bill , ' replied the Jew , putting down the glass after just setting his lips to it .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 15]: You 're afraid of our getting the better of you , are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 10]: inquired Sikes , fixing his eyes on the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 4]: ` Ugh ! '
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 41]: With a hoarse grunt of contempt , Mr. Sikes seized the glass , and threw the remainder of its contents into the ashes : as a preparatory ceremony to filling it again for himself : which he did at once .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 39]: The Jew glanced round the room , as his companion tossed down the second glassful ; not in curiousity , for he had seen it often before ; but in a restless and suspicious manner habitual to him .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 61]: It was a meanly furnished apartment , with nothing but the contents of the closet to induce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man ; and with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner , and a ` life-preserver ' that hung over the chimney-piece .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 11]: ` There , ' said Sikes , smacking his lips .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 7]: ` Now I 'm ready . '
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 5]: ` For business ? '
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 4]: inquired the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 19]: ` For business , ' replied Sikes ; ` so say what you 've got to say . '
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 10]: ` About the crib at Chertsey , Bill ? '
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 17]: said the Jew , drawing his chair forward , and speaking in a very low voice .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 5]: Wot about it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 3]: inquired Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 14]: you know what I mean , my dear , ' said the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 14]: ` He knows what I mean , Nancy ; do n't he ? '
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 12]: ` No , he do n't , ' sneered Mr. Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 13]: ` Or he wo n't , and that 's the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 41]: Speak out , and call things by their right names ; do n't sit there , winking and blinking , and talking to me in hints , as if you war n't the very first that thought about the robbery .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 5]: Wot d'ye mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 8]: ` Hush , Bill , hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 25]: said the Jew , who had in vain attempted to stop this burst of indignation ; ` somebody will hear us , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 6]: Somebody will hear us . '
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 6]: ` Let 'em hear ! '
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 10]: said Sikes ; ' I do n't care . '
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 24]: But as Mr. Sikes DID care , on reflection , he dropped his voice as he said the words , and grew calmer .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 12]: ` There , there , ' said the Jew , coaxingly .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 10]: ` It was only my caution , nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 22]: Now , my dear , about that crib at Chertsey ; when is it to be done , Bill , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 7]: When is it to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 10]: Such plate , my dear , such plate ! '
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 18]: said the Jew : rubbing his hands , and elevating his eyebrows in a rapture of anticipation .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 10]: ` Not at all , ' replied Sikes coldly .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 9]: ` Not to be done at all ! '
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 10]: echoed the Jew , leaning back in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 11]: ` No , not at all , ' rejoined Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 16]: ` At least it ca n't be a put-up job , as we expected . '
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 20]: ` Then it has n't been properly gone about , ' said the Jew , turning pale with anger .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 7]: ` Do n't tell me ! '
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 11]: ` But I will tell you , ' retorted Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 11]: ` Who are you that 's not to be told ?
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 29]: I tell you that Toby Crackit has been hanging about the place for a fortnight , and he ca n't get one of the servants in line . '
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 38]: ` Do you mean to tell me , Bill , ' said the Jew : softening as the other grew heated : ` that neither of the two men in the house can be got over ? '
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 15]: ` Yes , I do mean to tell you so , ' replied Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 30]: ` The old lady has had 'em these twenty years ; and if you were to give 'em five hundred pound , they would n't be in it . '
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 27]: ` But do you mean to say , my dear , ' remonstrated the Jew , ` that the women ca n't be got over ? '
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 11]: ` Not a bit of it , ' replied Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 8]: ` Not by flash Toby Crackit ? '
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 5]: said the Jew incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 23]: ` Think what women are , Bill , ' ` No ; not even by flash Toby Crackit , ' replied Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 34]: ` He says he 's worn sham whiskers , and a canary waistcoat , the whole blessed time he 's been loitering down there , and it 's all of no use . '
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 21]: ` He should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers , my dear , ' said the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 24]: ` So he did , ' rejoined Sikes , ` and they war n't of no more use than the other plant . '
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 8]: The Jew looked blank at this information .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 40]: After ruminating for some minutes with his chin sunk on his breast , he raised his head and said , with a deep sigh , that if flash Toby Crackit reported aright , he feared the game was up .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 41]: ` And yet , ' said the old man , dropping his hands on his knees , ` it 's a sad thing , my dear , to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it . '
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 10]: ` So it is , ' said Mr. Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 5]: ` Worse luck ! '
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 27]: A long silence ensued ; during which the Jew was plunged in deep thought , with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy perfectly demoniacal .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 9]: Sikes eyed him furtively from time to time .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 29]: Nancy , apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker , sat with her eyes fixed upon the fire , as if she had been deaf to all that passed .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 32]: ` Fagin , ' said Sikes , abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed ; ` is it worth fifty shiners extra , if it 's safely done from the outside ? '
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 13]: ` Yes , ' said the Jew , as suddenly rousing himself .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 7]: ` Is it a bargain ? '
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 3]: inquired Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 34]: ` Yes , my dear , yes , ' rejoined the Jew ; his eyes glistening , and every muscle in his face working , with the excitement that the inquiry had awakened .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 29]: ` Then , ' said Sikes , thrusting aside the Jew 's hand , with some disdain , ` let it come off as soon as you like .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 21]: Toby and me were over the garden-wall the night afore last , sounding the panels of the door and shutters .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 25]: The crib 's barred up at night like a jail ; but there 's one part we can crack , safe and softly . '
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 8]: ` Which is that , Bill ? '
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 5]: asked the Jew eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 19]: ` Why , ' whispered Sikes , ` as you cross the lawn -- ' ` Yes ? '
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 18]: said the Jew , bending his head forward , with his eyes almost starting out of it .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 4]: ` Umph ! '
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 30]: cried Sikes , stopping short , as the girl , scarcely moving her head , looked suddenly round , and pointed for an instant to the Jew 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 8]: ` Never mind which part it is .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 28]: You ca n't do it without me , I know ; but it 's best to be on the safe side when one deals with you . '
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 16]: ` As you like , my dear , as you like ' replied the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 14]: ` Is there no help wanted , but yours and Toby 's ? '
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 7]: ` None , ' said Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 8]: ` Cept a centre-bit and a boy .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 16]: The first we 've both got ; the second you must find us . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 4]: A boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 4]: exclaimed the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 9]: then it 's a panel , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 8]: ` Never mind wot it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 4]: replied Sikes . '
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 15]: I want a boy , and he mus n't be a big ` un .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 3]: Lord ! '
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 22]: said Mr. Sikes , reflectively , ` if I 'd only got that young boy of Ned , the chimbley-sweeper 's !
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 15]: He kept him small on purpose , and let him out by the job .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 45]: But the father gets lagged ; and then the Juvenile Delinquent Society comes , and takes the boy away from a trade where he was arning money , teaches him to read and write , and in time makes a ` prentice of him .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 67]: And so they go on , ' said Mr. Sikes , his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs , ` so they go on ; and , if they 'd got money enough -LRB- which it 's a Providence they have n't , -RRB- we should n't have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade , in a year or two . '
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 27]: ` No more we should , ' acquiesed the Jew , who had been considering during this speech , and had only caught the last sentence .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 4]: ` Bill ! '
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 5]: ` What now ? '
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 3]: inquired Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 34]: The Jew nodded his head towards Nancy , who was still gazing at the fire ; and intimated , by a sign , that he would have her told to leave the room .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 31]: Sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently , as if he thought the precaution unnecessary ; but complied , nevertheless , by requesting Miss Nancy to fetch him a jug of beer .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 24]: ` You do n't want any beer , ' said Nancy , folding her arms , and retaining her seat very composedly . '
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 7]: I tell you I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 3]: replied Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 15]: ` Nonsense , ' rejoined the girl coolly , ` Go on , Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 18]: I know what he 's going to say , Bill ; he need n't mind me . '
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 5]: The Jew still hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 11]: Sikes looked from one to the other in some surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 17]: ` Why , you do n't mind the old girl , do you , Fagin ? '
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 5]: he asked at length .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 18]: ` You 've known her long enough to trust her , or the Devil 's in it .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 7]: She ai n't one to blab .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 6]: Are you Nancy ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 6]: I should think not ! '
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 20]: replied the young lady : drawing her chair up to the table , and putting her elbows upon it .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 30]: ` No , no , my dear , I know you 're not , ' said the Jew ; ` but -- ' and again the old man paused .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 5]: ` But wot ? '
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 4]: inquired Sikes . '
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 36]: I did n't know whether she might n't p ` r ` aps be out of sorts , you know , my dear , as she was the other night , ' replied the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 42]: At this confession , Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh ; and , swallowing a glass of brandy , shook her head with an air of defiance , and burst into sundry exclamations of ` Keep the game a-going ! '
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 6]: ` Never say die ! '
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 4]: and the like .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 33]: These seemed to have the effect of re-assuring both gentlemen ; for the Jew nodded his head with a satisfied air , and resumed his seat : as did Mr. Sikes likewise .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 12]: ` Now , Fagin , ' said Nancy with a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 10]: ` Tell Bill at once , about Oliver ! '
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 3]: ` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 17]: you 're a clever one , my dear : the sharpest girl I ever saw ! '
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 10]: said the Jew , patting her on the neck .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 14]: ` It WAS about Oliver I was going to speak , sure enough .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 3]: ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 6]: ` What about him ? '
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 3]: demanded Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 34]: ` He 's the boy for you , my dear , ' replied the Jew in a hoarse whisper ; laying his finger on the side of his nose , and grinning frightfully .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 4]: ` He ! '
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 2]: exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 2]: Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 7]: ` Have him , Bill ! '
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 4]: said Nancy . '
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 10]: I would , if I was in your place .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 33]: He may n't be so much up , as any of the others ; but that 's not what you want , if he 's only to open a door for you .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 13]: Depend upon it he 's a safe one , Bill . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 9]: I know he is , ' rejoined Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 24]: ` He 's been in good training these last few weeks , and it 's time he began to work for his bread .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 10]: Besides , the others are all too big . '
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 18]: ` Well , he is just the size I want , ' said Mr. Sikes , ruminating .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 25]: ` And will do everything you want , Bill , my dear , ' interposed the Jew ; ` he ca n't help himself .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 10]: That is , if you frighten him enough . '
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 5]: ` Frighten him ! '
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 3]: echoed Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 11]: ` It 'll be no sham frightening , mind you .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 25]: If there 's anything queer about him when we once get into the work ; in for a penny , in for a pound .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 10]: You wo n't see him alive again , Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 9]: Think of that , before you send him .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 5]: Mark my words ! '
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 17]: said the robber , poising a crowbar , which he had drawn from under the bedstead .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 15]: ` I 've thought of it all , ' said the Jew with energy .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 19]: ` I 've -- I 've had my eye upon him , my dears , close -- close .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 30]: Once let him feel that he is one of us ; once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief ; and he 's ours !
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 5]: Ours for his life .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 2]: Oho !
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 8]: It could n't have come about better !
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 27]: The old man crossed his arms upon his breast ; and , drawing his head and shoulders into a heap , literally hugged himself for joy .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 4]: ` Ours ! '
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 3]: said Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 7]: ` Yours , you mean . '
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 18]: ` Perhaps I do , my dear , ' said the Jew , with a shrill chuckle .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 10]: ` Mine , if you like , Bill . '
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 51]: ` And wot , ' said Sikes , scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend , ` wot makes you take so much pains about one chalk-faced kid , when you know there are fifty boys snoozing about Common Garden every night , as you might pick and choose from ? '
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 28]: ` Because they 're of no use to me , my dear , ' replied the Jew , with some confusion , ` not worth the taking .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 16]: Their looks convict 'em when they get into trouble , and I lose 'em all .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 22]: With this boy , properly managed , my dears , I could do what I could n't with twenty of them .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 36]: Besides , ' said the Jew , recovering his self-possession , ` he has us now if he could only give us leg-bail again ; and he must be in the same boat with us .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 29]: Never mind how he came there ; it 's quite enough for my power over him that he was in a robbery ; that 's all I want .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 36]: Now , how much better this is , than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the way -- which would be dangerous , and we should lose by it besides . '
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 9]: ` When is it to be done ? '
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 28]: asked Nancy , stopping some turbulent exclamation on the part of Mr. Sikes , expressive of the disgust with which he received Fagin 's affectation of humanity .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 24]: ` Ah , to be sure , ' said the Jew ; ` when is it to be done , Bill ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 30]: I planned with Toby , the night arter to-morrow , ' rejoined Sikes in a surly voice , ` if he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy . '
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 15]: ` Good , ' said the Jew ; ` there 's no moon . '
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 7]: ` No , ' rejoined Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 15]: ` It 's all arranged about bringing off the swag , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 4]: asked the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 3]: Sikes nodded .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 22]: ` And about -- ' ` Oh , ah , it 's all planned , ' rejoined Sikes , interrupting him .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 5]: ` Never mind particulars .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 10]: You 'd better bring the boy here to-morrow night .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 11]: I shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 23]: Then you hold your tongue , and keep the melting-pot ready , and that 's all you 'll have to do . '
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 77]: After some discussion , in which all three took an active part , it was decided that Nancy should repair to the Jew 's next evening when the night had set in , and bring Oliver away with her ; Fagin craftily observing , that , if he evinced any disinclination to the task , he would be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in his behalf , than anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 114]: It was also solemnly arranged that poor Oliver should , for the purposes of the contemplated expedition , be unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of Mr. William Sikes ; and further , that the said Sikes should deal with him as he thought fit ; and should not be held responsible by the Jew for any mischance or evil that might be necessary to visit him : it being understood that , to render the compact in this respect binding , any representations made by Mr. Sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and corroborated , in all important particulars , by the testimony of flash Toby Crackit .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 44]: These preliminaries adjusted , Mr. Sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a furious rate , and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner ; yelling forth , at the same time , most unmusical snatches of song , mingled with wild execrations .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 73]: At length , in a fit of professional enthusiasm , he insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools : which he had no sooner stumbled in with , and opened for the purpose of explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it contained , and the peculiar beauties of their construction , than he fell over the box upon the floor , and went to sleep where he fell .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 16]: ` Good-night , Nancy , ' said the Jew , muffling himself up as before .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 4]: ` Good-night . '
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 12]: Their eyes met , and the Jew scrutinised her , narrowly .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 8]: There was no flinching about the girl .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 16]: She was as true and earnest in the matter as Toby Crackit himself could be .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 29]: The Jew again bade her good-night , and , bestowing a sly kick upon the prostrate form of Mr. Sikes while her back was turned , groped downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 6]: ` Always the way ! '
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 10]: muttered the Jew to himself as he turned homeward .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 34]: ` The worst of these women is , that a very little thing serves to call up some long-forgotten feeling ; and , the best of them is , that it never lasts .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 13]: The man against the child , for a bag of gold ! '
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 36]: Beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections , Mr. Fagin wended his way , through mud and mire , to his gloomy abode : where the Dodger was sitting up , impatiently awaiting his return .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 5]: ` Is Oliver a-bed ?
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 18]: I want to speak to him , ' was his first remark as they descended the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 14]: ` Hours ago , ' replied the Dodger , throwing open a door .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 6]: ` Here he is ! '
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 95]: The boy was lying , fast asleep , on a rude bed upon the floor ; so pale with anxiety , and sadness , and the closeness of his prison , that he looked like death ; not death as it shows in shroud and coffin , but in the guise it wears when life has just departed ; when a young and gentle spirit has , but an instant , fled to Heaven , and the gross air of the world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 13]: ` Not now , ' said the Jew , turning softly away .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 3]: ` To-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 3]: To-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 54]: CHAPTER XX WHEREIN OLVER IS DELIVERED OVER TO MR. WILLIAM SIKES When Oliver awoke in the morning , he was a good deal surprised to find that a new pair of shoes , with strong thick soles , had been placed at his bedside ; and that his old shoes had been removed .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 68]: At first , he was pleased with the discovery : hoping that it might be the forerunner of his release ; but such thoughts were quickly dispelled , on his sitting down to breakfast along with the Jew , who told him , in a tone and manner which increased his alarm , that he was to be taken to the residence of Bill Sikes that night .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 11]: ` To -- to -- stop there , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 5]: asked Oliver , anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 8]: ` No , no , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 10]: Not to stop there , ' replied the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 9]: ` We should n't like to lose you .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 15]: Do n't be afraid , Oliver , you shall come back to us again .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 15]: We wo n't be so cruel as to send you away , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 6]: Oh no , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 47]: The old man , who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread , looked round as he bantered Oliver thus ; and chuckled as if to show that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could . '
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 35]: I suppose , ' said the Jew , fixing his eyes on Oliver , ` you want to know what you 're going to Bill 's for -- - eh , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 29]: Oliver coloured , involuntarily , to find that the old thief had been reading his thoughts ; but boldly said , Yes , he did want to know .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 8]: ` Why , do you think ? '
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 7]: inquired Fagin , parrying the question .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 13]: ` Indeed I do n't know , sir , ' replied Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 4]: ` Bah ! '
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 20]: said the Jew , turning away with a disappointed countenance from a close perusal of the boy 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 10]: ` Wait till Bill tells you , then . '
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 57]: The Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver 's not expressing any greater curiosity on the subject ; but the truth is , that , although Oliver felt very anxious , he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of Fagin 's looks , and his own speculations , to make any further inquiries just then .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 24]: He had no other opportunity : for the Jew remained very surly and silent till night : when he prepared to go abroad .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 18]: ` You may burn a candle , ' said the Jew , putting one upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 18]: ` And here 's a book for you to read , till they come to fetch you .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 3]: Good-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 4]: ` Good-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 5]: replied Oliver , softly .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 18]: The Jew walked to the door : looking over his shoulder at the boy as he went .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 10]: Suddenly stopping , he called him by his name .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 18]: Oliver looked up ; the Jew , pointing to the candle , motioned him to light it .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 39]: He did so ; and , as he placed the candlestick upon the table , saw that the Jew was gazing fixedly at him , with lowering and contracted brows , from the dark end of the room .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 6]: ` Take heed , Oliver !
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 4]: take heed ! '
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 16]: said the old man , shaking his right hand before him in a warning manner .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 18]: ` He 's a rough man , and thinks nothing of blood when his own is up .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 15]: W hatever falls out , say nothing ; and do what he bids you .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 3]: Mind ! '
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 32]: Placing a strong emphasis on the last word , he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin , and , nodding his head , left the room .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 29]: Oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared , and pondered , with a trembling heart , on the words he had just heard .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 25]: The more he thought of the Jew 's admonition , the more he was at a loss to divine its real purpose and meaning .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 66]: He could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to Sikes , which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with Fagin ; and after meditating for a long time , concluded that he had been selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker , until another boy , better suited for his purpose could be engaged .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 26]: He was too well accustomed to suffering , and had suffered too much where he was , to bewail the prospect of change very severely .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 39]: He remained lost in thought for some minutes ; and then , with a heavy sigh , snuffed the candle , and , taking up the book which the Jew had left with him , began to read .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 6]: He turned over the leaves .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 23]: Carelessly at first ; but , lighting on a passage which attracted his attention , he soon became intent upon the volume .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 23]: It was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals ; and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 93]: Here , he read of dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold ; of secret murders that had been committed by the lonely wayside ; of bodies hidden from the eye of man in deep pits and wells : which would not keep them down , deep as they were , but had yielded them up at last , after many years , and so maddened the murderers with the sight , that in their horror they had confessed their guilt , and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 57]: Here , too , he read of men who , lying in their beds at dead of night , had been tempted -LRB- so they said -RRB- and led on , by their own bad thoughts , to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep , and the limbs quail , to think of .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 50]: The terrible descriptions were so real and vivid , that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore ; and the words upon them , to be sounded in his ears , as if they were whispered , in hollow murmers , by the spirits of the dead .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 18]: In a paroxysm of fear , the boy closed the book , and thrust it from him .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 39]: Then , falling upon his knees , he prayed Heaven to spare him from such deeds ; and rather to will that he should die at once , than be reserved for crimes , so fearful and appaling .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 78]: By degrees , he grew more calm , and besought , in a low and broken voice , that he might be rescued from his present dangers ; and that if any aid were to be raised up for a poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred , it might come to him now , when , desolate and deserted , he stood alone in the midst of wickedness and guilt .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 24]: He had concluded his prayer , but still remained with his head buried in his hands , when a rustling noise aroused him .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 6]: ` What 's that ! '
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 17]: he cried , starting up , and catching sight of a figure standing by the door .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 6]: ` Who 's there ? '
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 3]: ` Me .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 9]: Only me , ' replied a tremulous voice .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 14]: Oliver raised the candle above his head : and looked towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 4]: It was Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 16]: ` Put down the light , ' said the girl , turning away her head .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 7]: ` It hurts my eyes . '
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 16]: Oliver saw that she was very pale , and gently inquired if she were ill .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 24]: The girl threw herself into a chair , with her back towards him : and wrung her hands ; but made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 6]: ` God forgive me ! '
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 14]: she cried after a while , ' I never thought of this . '
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 6]: ` Has anything happened ? '
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 3]: asked Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 6]: ` Can I help you ?
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 6]: I will if I can .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 6]: I will , indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 22]: She rocked herself to and fro ; caught her throat ; and , uttering a gurgling sound , gasped for breath .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 4]: ` Nancy ! '
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 9]: cried Oliver , ` What is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 33]: The girl beat her hands upon her knees , and her feet upon the ground ; and , suddenly stopping , drew her shawl close round her : and shivered with cold .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 5]: Oliver stirred the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 32]: Drawing her chair close to it , she sat there , for a little time , without speaking ; but at length she raised her head , and looked round . '
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 34]: I do n't know what comes over me sometimes , ' said she , affecting to busy herself in arranging her dress ; ` it 's this damp dirty room , I think .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 11]: Now , Nolly , dear , are you ready ? '
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 9]: ` Am I to go with you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 3]: asked Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 11]: I have come from Bill , ' replied the girl .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 9]: ` You are to go with me . '
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 5]: ` What for ? '
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 5]: asked Oliver , recoiling .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 5]: ` What for ? '
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 22]: echoed the girl , raising her eyes , and averting them again , the moment they encountered the boy 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 6]: For no harm . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 16]: I do n't believe it , ' said Oliver : who had watched her closely .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 16]: ` Have it your own way , ' rejoined the girl , affecting to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 8]: ` For no good , then . '
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 32]: Oliver could see that he had some power over the girl 's better feelings , and , for an instant , thought of appealing to her compassion for his helpless state .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 41]: But , then , the thought darted across his mind that it was barely eleven o'clock ; and that many people were still in the streets : of whom surely some might be found to give credence to his tale .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 22]: As the reflection occured to him , he stepped forward : and said , somewhat hastily , that he was ready .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 15]: Neither his brief consideration , nor its purport , was lost on his companion .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 31]: She eyed him narrowly , while he spoke ; and cast upon him a look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what had been passing in his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 19]: said the girl , stooping over him , and pointing to the door as she looked cautiously round .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 7]: ` You ca n't help yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 13]: I have tried hard for you , but all to no purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 7]: You are hedged round and round .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 17]: If ever you are to get loose from here , this is not the time . '
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 18]: Struck by the energy of her manner , Oliver looked up in her face with great surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 22]: She seemed to speak the truth ; her countenance was white and agitated ; and she trembled with very earnestness . '
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 48]: I have saved you from being ill-used once , and I will again , and I do now , ' continued the girl aloud ; ` for those who would have fetched you , if I had not , would have been far more rough than me .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 32]: I have promised for your being quiet and silent ; if you are not , you will only do harm to yourself and me too , and perhaps be my death .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 3]: See here !
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 19]: I have borne all this for you already , as true as God sees me show it . '
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 26]: She pointed , hastily , to some livid bruises on her neck and arms ; and continued , with great rapidity : ` Remember this !
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 13]: And do n't let me suffer more for you , just now .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 16]: If I could help you , I would ; but I have not the power .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 20]: They do n't mean to harm you ; whatever they make you do , is no fault of yours .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 10]: Every word from you is a blow for me .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 5]: Give me your hand .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 3]: Make haste !
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 3]: Your hand !
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 26]: She caught the hand which Oliver instinctively placed in hers , and , blowing out the light , drew him after her up the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 27]: The door was opened , quickly , by some one shrouded in the darkness , and was as quickly closed , when they had passed out .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 32]: A hackney-cabriolet was in waiting ; with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing Oliver , the girl pulled him in with her , and drew the curtains close .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 21]: The driver wanted no directions , but lashed his horse into full speed , without the delay of an instant .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 27]: The girl still held Oliver fast by the hand , and continued to pour into his ear , the warnings and assurances she had already imparted .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 45]: All was so quick and hurried , that he had scarcely time to recollect where he was , or how he came there , when to carriage stopped at the house to which the Jew 's steps had been directed on the previous evening .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 25]: For one brief moment , Oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty street , and a cry for help hung upon his lips .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 31]: But the girl 's voice was in his ear , beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her , that he had not the heart to utter it .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 22]: While he hesitated , the opportunity was gone ; he was already in the house , and the door was shut .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 17]: ` This way , ' said the girl , releasing her hold for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 4]: ` Bill ! '
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 4]: ` Hallo ! '
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 15]: replied Sikes : appearing at the head of the stairs , with a candle .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 7]: That 's the time of day .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 4]: Come on ! '
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 23]: This was a very strong expression of approbation , an uncommonly hearty welcome , from a person of Mr. Sikes ' temperament .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 11]: Nancy , appearing much gratified thereby , saluted him cordially .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 21]: ` Bull 's - eye 's gone home with Tom , ' observed Sikes , as he lighted them up .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 10]: ` He 'd have been in the way . '
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 9]: ` That 's right , ' rejoined Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 26]: ` So you 've got the kid , ' said Sikes when they had all reached the room : closing the door as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 11]: ` Yes , here he is , ' replied Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 7]: ` Did he come quiet ? '
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 3]: inquired Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 9]: ` Like a lamb , ' rejoined Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 34]: ` I 'm glad to hear it , ' said Sikes , looking grimly at Oliver ; ` for the sake of his young carcase : as would otherways have suffered for it .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 26]: Come here , young ` un ; and let me read you a lectur ' , which is as well got over at once . '
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 45]: Thus addressing his new pupil , Mr. Sikes pulled off Oliver 's cap and threw it into a corner ; and then , taking him by the shoulder , sat himself down by the table , and stood the boy in front of him .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 13]: ` Now , first : do you know wot this is ? '
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 13]: inquired Sikes , taking up a pocket-pistol which lay on the table .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 6]: Oliver replied in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 12]: ` Well , then , look here , ' continued Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 27]: ` This is powder ; that ` ere 's a bullet ; and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin ' . '
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 26]: Oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to ; and Mr. Sikes proceeded to load the pistol , with great nicety and deliberation .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 16]: ` Now it 's loaded , ' said Mr. Sikes , when he had finished .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 14]: ` Yes , I see it is , sir , ' replied Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 70]: ` Well , ' said the robber , grasping Oliver 's wrist , and putting the barrel so close to his temple that they touched ; at which moment the boy could not repress a start ; ` if you speak a word when you 're out o ' doors with me , except when I speak to you , that loading will be in your head without notice .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 20]: So , if you DO make up your mind to speak without leave , say your prayers first . '
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 20]: Having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning , to increase its effect , Mr. Sikes continued .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 50]: ` As near as I know , there is n't anybody as would be asking very partickler arter you , if you WAS disposed of ; so I need n't take this devil-and-all of trouble to explain matters to you , if it war n't for you own good .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 5]: D'ye hear me ? '
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 101]: ` The short and the long of what you mean , ' said Nancy : speaking very emphatically , and slightly frowning at Oliver as if to bespeak his serious attention to her words : ` is , that if you 're crossed by him in this job you have on hand , you 'll prevent his ever telling tales afterwards , by shooting him through the head , and will take your chance of swinging for it , as you do for a great many other things in the way of business , every month of your life . '
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 6]: ` That 's it ! '
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 16]: observed Mr. Sikes , approvingly ; ` women can always put things in fewest words .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 15]: -- Except when it 's blowing up ; and then they lengthens it out .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 24]: And now that he 's thoroughly up to it , let 's have some supper , and get a snooze before starting . '
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 78]: In pursuance of this request , Nancy quickly laid the cloth ; disappearing for a few minutes , she presently returned with a pot of porter and a dish of sheep 's heads : which gave occasion to several pleasant witticisms on the part of Mr. Sikes , founded upon the singular coincidence of ` jemmies ' being a can name , common to them , and also to an ingenious implement much used in his profession .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 69]: Indeed , the worthy gentleman , stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on active service , was in great spirits and good humour ; in proof whereof , it may be here remarked , that he humourously drank all the beer at a draught , and did not utter , on a rough calculation , more than four-score oaths during the whole progress of the meal .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 56]: Supper being ended -- it may be easily conceived that Oliver had no great appetite for it -- Mr. Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits and water , and threw himself on the bed ; ordering Nancy , with many imprecations in case of failure , to call him at five precisely .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 43]: Oliver stretched himself in his clothes , by command of the same authority , on a mattress upon the floor ; and the girl , mending the fire , sat before it , in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 45]: For a long time Oliver lay awake , thinking it not impossible that Nancy might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice ; but the girl sat brooding over the fire , without moving , save now and then to trim the light .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 12]: Weary with watching and anxiety , he at length fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 33]: When he awoke , the table was covered with tea-things , and Sikes was thrusting various articles into the pockets of his great-coat , which hung over the back of a chair .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 8]: Nancy was busily engaged in preparing breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 20]: It was not yet daylight ; for the candle was still burning , and it was quite dark outside .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 20]: A sharp rain , too , was beating against the window-panes ; and the sky looked black and cloudy .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 6]: ` Now , then ! '
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 12]: growled Sikes , as Oliver started up ; ` half-past five !
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 19]: Look sharp , or you 'll get no breakfast ; for it 's late as it is . '
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 31]: Oliver was not long in making his toilet ; having taken some breakfast , he replied to a surly inquiry from Sikes , by saying that he was quite ready .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 31]: Nancy , scarcely looking at the boy , threw him a handkerchief to tie round his throat ; Sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 53]: Thus attired , he gave his hand to the robber , who , merely pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same pistol in a side-pocket of his great-coat , clasped it firmly in his , and , exchanging a farewell with Nancy , led him away .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 24]: Oliver turned , for an instant , when they reached the door , in the hope of meeting a look from the girl .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 21]: But she had resumed her old seat in front of the fire , and sat , perfectly motionless before it .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 29]: CHAPTER XXI THE EXPEDITION It was a cheerless morning when they got into the street ; blowing and raining hard ; and the clouds looking dull and stormy .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 23]: The night had been very wet : large pools of water had collected in the road : and the kennels were overflowing .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 55]: There was a faint glimmering of the coming day in the sky ; but it rather aggrevated than relieved the gloom of the scene : the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street lamps afforded , without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the wet house-tops , and dreary streets .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 36]: There appeared to be nobody stirring in that quarter of the town ; the windows of the houses were all closely shut ; and the streets through which they passed , were noiseless and empty .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 20]: By the time they had turned into the Bethnal Green Road , the day had fairly begun to break .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 79]: Many of the lamps were already extinguished ; a few country waggons were slowly toiling on , towards London ; now and then , a stage-coach , covered with mud , rattled briskly by : the driver bestowing , as he passed , and admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner who , by keeping on the wrong side of the road , had endangered his arriving at the office , a quarter of a minute after his time .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 12]: The public-houses , with gas-lights burning inside , were already open .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 19]: By degrees , other shops began to be unclosed , and a few scattered people were met with .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 61]: Then , came straggling groups of labourers going to their work ; then , men and women with fish-baskets on their heads ; donkey-carts laden with vegetables ; chaise-carts filled with live-stock or whole carcasses of meat ; milk-women with pails ; an unbroken concourse of people , trudging out with various supplies to the eastern suburbs of the town .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 34]: As they approached the City , the noise and traffic gradually increased ; when they threaded the streets between Shoreditch and Smithfield , it had swelled into a roar of sound and bustle .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 29]: It was as light as it was likely to be , till night came on again , and the busy morning of half the London population had begun .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 53]: Turning down Sun Street and Crown Street , and crossing Finsbury square , Mr. Sikes struck , by way of Chiswell Street , into Barbican : thence into Long Lane , and so into Smithfield ; from which latter place arose a tumult of discordant sounds that filled Oliver Twist with amazement .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 4]: It was market-morning .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 45]: The ground was covered , nearly ankle-deep , with filth and mire ; a thick steam , perpetually rising from the reeking bodies of the cattle , and mingling with the fog , which seemd to rest upon the chimney-tops , hung heavily above .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 51]: All the pens in the centre of the large area , and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into the vacant space , were filled with sheep ; tied up to posts by the gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen , three or four deep .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 155]: Countrymen , butchers , drovers , hawkers , boys , thieves , idlers , and vagabonds of every low grade , were mingled together in a mass ; the whistling of drovers , the barking dogs , the bellowing and plunging of the oxen , the bleating of sheep , the grunting and squeaking of pigs , the cries of hawkers , the shouts , oaths , and quarrelling on all sides ; the ringing of bells and roar of voices , that issued from every public-house ; the crowding , pushing , driving , beating , whooping and yelling ; the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every corner of the market ; and the unwashed , unshaven , squalid , and dirty figues constantly running to and fro , and bursting in and out of the throng ; rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene , which quite confounded the senses .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 36]: Mr. Sikes , dragging Oliver after him , elbowed his way through the thickest of the crowd , and bestowed very little attention on the numerous sights and sounds , which so astonished the boy .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 47]: He nodded , twice or thrice , to a passing friend ; and , resisting as many invitations to take a morning dram , pressed steadily onward , until they were clear of the turmoil , and had made their way through Hosier Lane into Holborn .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 8]: ` Now , young ` un ! '
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 19]: said Sikes , looking up at the clock of St. Andrew 's Church , ` hard upon seven !
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 5]: you must step out .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 11]: Come , do n't lag behind already , Lazy-legs ! '
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 48]: Mr. Sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companion 's wrist ; Oliver , quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast walk and a run , kept up with the rapid strides of the house-breaker as well as he could .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 45]: They held their course at this rate , until they had passed Hyde Park corner , and were on their way to Kensington : when Sikes relaxed his pace , until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind , came up .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 33]: Seeing ` Hounslow ' written on it , he asked the driver with as much civility as he could assume , if he would give them a lift as far as Isleworth .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 9]: ` Jump up , ' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 7]: ` Is that your boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 30]: ` Yes ; he 's my boy , ' replied Sikes , looking hard at Oliver , and putting his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 18]: ` Your father walks rather too quick for you , do n't he , my man ? '
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 12]: inquired the driver : seeing that Oliver was out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 13]: ` Not a bit of it , ' replied Sikes , interposing .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 7]: ` He 's used to it .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 10]: Here , take hold of my hand , Ned .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 5]: In with you ! '
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 33]: Thus addressing Oliver , he helped him into the cart ; and the driver , pointing to a heap of sacks , told him to lie down there , and rest himself .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 22]: As they passed the different mile-stones , Oliver wondered , more and more , where his companion meant to take him .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 32]: Kensington , Hammersmith , Chiswick , Kew Bridge , Brentford , were all passed ; and yet they went on as steadily as if they had only just begun their journey .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 27]: At length , they came to a public-house called the Coach and Horses ; a little way beyond which , another road appeared to run off .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 7]: And here , the cart stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 41]: Sikes dismounted with great precipitation , holding Oliver by the hand all the while ; and lifting him down directly , bestowed a furious look upon him , and rapped the side-pocket with his fist , in a significant manner .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 10]: ` Good-bye , boy , ' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 19]: ` He 's sulky , ' replied Sikes , giving him a shake ; ` he 's sulky .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 4]: A young dog !
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 6]: Do n't mind him . '
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 5]: ` Not I ! '
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 9]: rejoined the other , getting into his cart .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 11]: ` It 's a fine day , after all . '
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 5]: And he drove away .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 31]: Sikes waited until he had fairly gone ; and then , telling Oliver he might look about him if he wanted , once again led him onward on his journey .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 59]: They turned round to the left , a short way past the public-house ; and then , taking a right-hand road , walked on for a long time : passing many large gardens and gentlemen 's houses on both sides of the way , and stopping for nothing but a little beer , until they reached a town .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 21]: Here against the wall of a house , Oliver saw written up in pretty large letters , ` Hampton . '
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 12]: They lingered about , in the fields , for some hours .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 29]: At length they came back into the town ; and , turning into an old public-house with a defaced sign-board , ordered some dinner by the kitchen fire .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 47]: The kitchen was an old , low-roofed room ; with a great beam across the middle of the ceiling , and benches , with high backs to them , by the fire ; on which were seated several rough men in smock-frocks , drinking and smoking .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 44]: They took no notice of Oliver ; and very little of Sikes ; and , as Sikes took very little notice of the , he and his young comrade sat in a corner by themselves , without being much troubled by their company .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 40]: They had some cold meat for dinner , and sat so long after it , while Mr. Sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes , that Oliver began to feel quite certain they were not going any further .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 36]: Being much tired with the walk , and getting up so early , he dozed a little at first ; then , quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco , fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 14]: It was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 31]: Rousing himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him , he found that worthy in close fellowship and communication with a labouring man , over a pint of ale .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 15]: ` So , you 're going on to Lower Halliford , are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 3]: inquired Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 38]: ` Yes , I am , ' replied the man , who seemed a little the worse -- or better , as the case might be -- for drinking ; ` and not slow about it neither .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 32]: My horse has n't got a load behind him going back , as he had coming up in the mornin ' ; and he wo n't be long a-doing of it .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 6]: Here 's luck to him .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 2]: Ecod !
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 8]: he 's a good ` un ! '
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 16]: ` Could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there ? '
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 11]: demanded Sikes , pushing the ale towards his new friend .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 21]: ` If you 're going directly , I can , ' replied the man , looking out of the pot .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 8]: ` Are you going to Halliford ? '
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 10]: ` Going on to Shepperton , ' replied Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 17]: ` I 'm your man , as far as I go , ' replied the other .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 8]: ` Is all paid , Becky ? '
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 15]: ` Yes , the other gentleman 's paid , ' replied the girl . '
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 4]: I say ! '
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 18]: said the man , with tipsy gravity ; ` that wo n't do , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 5]: ` Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 3]: rejoined Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 26]: ` You 're a-going to accommodate us , and wot 's to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so , in return ? '
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 33]: The stranger reflected upon this argument , with a very profound face ; having done so , he seized Sikes by the hand : and declared he was a real good fellow .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 29]: To which Mr. Sikes replied , he was joking ; as , if he had been sober , there would have been strong reason to suppose he was .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 50]: After the exchange of a few more compliments , they bade the company good-night , and went out ; the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as they did so , and lounging out to the door , with her hands full , to see the party start .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 22]: The horse , whose health had been drunk in his absence , was standing outside : ready harnessed to the cart .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 48]: Oliver and Sikes got in without any further ceremony ; and the man to whom he belonged , having lingered for a minute or two ` to bear him up , ' and to defy the hostler and the world to produce his equal , mounted also .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 81]: Then , the hostler was told to give the horse his head ; and , his head being given him , he made a very unpleasant use of it : tossing it into the air with great disdain , and running into the parlour windows over the way ; after performing those feats , and supporting himself for a short time on his hind-legs , he started off at great speed , and rattled out of the town right gallantly .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 6]: The night was very dark .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 22]: A damp mist rose from the river , and the marshy ground about ; and spread itself over the dreary fields .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 13]: It was piercing cold , too ; all was gloomy and black .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 25]: Not a word was spoken ; for the driver had grown sleepy ; and Sikes was in no mood to lead him into conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 48]: Oliver sat huddled together , in a corner of the cart ; bewildered with alarm and apprehension ; and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees , whose branches waved grimly to and fro , as if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 11]: As they passed Sunbury Church , the clock struck seven .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 30]: There was a light in the ferry-house window opposite : which streamed across the road , and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew-tree with graves beneath it .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 26]: There was a dull sound of falling water not far off ; and the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the night wind .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 12]: It seemed like quiet music for the repose of the dead .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 14]: Sunbury was passed through , and they came again into the lonely road .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 11]: Two or three miles more , and the cart stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 16]: Sikes alighted , took Oliver by the hand , and they once again walked on .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 51]: They turned into no house at Shepperton , as the weary boy had expected ; but still kept walking on , in mud and darkness , through gloomy lanes and over cold open wastes , until they came within sight of the lights of a town at no great distance .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 27]: On looking intently forward , Oliver saw that the water was just below them , and that they were coming to the foot of a bridge .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 23]: Sikes kept straight on , until they were close upon the bridge ; then turned suddenly down a bank upon the left .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 5]: ` The water ! '
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 8]: thought Oliver , turning sick with fear .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 14]: ` He has brought me to this lonely place to murder me ! '
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 35]: He was about to throw himself on the ground , and make one struggle for his young life , when he saw that they stood before a solitary house : all ruinous and decayed .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 23]: There was a window on each side of the dilapidated entrance ; and one story above ; but no light was visible .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 14]: The house was dark , dismantled : and the all appearance , uninhabited .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 21]: Sikes , with Oliver 's hand still in his , softly approached the low porch , and raised the latch .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 13]: The door yielded to the pressure , and they passed in together .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 8]: CHAPTER XXII THE BURGLARY ` Hallo ! '
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 17]: cried a loud , hoarse voice , as soon as they set foot in the passage .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 16]: ` Do n't make such a row , ' said Sikes , bolting the door .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 8]: ` Show a glim , Toby . '
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 3]: ` Aha !
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 4]: my pal ! '
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 6]: cried the same voice . '
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 8]: A glim , Barney , a glim !
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 15]: Show the gentleman in , Barney ; wake up first , if convenient . '
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 55]: The speaker appeared to throw a boot-jack , or some such article , at the person he addressed , to rouse him from his slumbers : for the noise of a wooden body , falling violently , was heard ; and then an indistinct muttering , as of a man between sleep and awake .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 6]: ` Do you hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 5]: cried the same voice .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 35]: ` There 's Bill Sikes in the passage with nobody to do the civil to him ; and you sleeping there , as if you took laudanum with your meals , and nothing stronger .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 19]: Are you any fresher now , or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you thoroughly ? '
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 77]: A pair of slipshod feet shuffled , hastily , across the bare floor of the room , as this interrogatory was put ; and there issued , from a door on the right hand ; first , a feeble candle : and next , the form of the same individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the infirmity of speaking through his nose , and officiating as waiter at the public-house on Saffron Hill .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 5]: ` Bister Sikes ! '
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 19]: exclaimed Barney , with real or counterfeit joy ; ` cub id , sir ; cub id . '
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 3]: ` Here !
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 16]: you get on first , ' said Sikes , putting Oliver in front of him .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 3]: ` Quicker !
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 9]: or I shall tread upon your heels . '
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 66]: Muttering a curse upon his tardiness , Sikes pushed Oliver before him ; and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire , two or three broken chairs , a table , and a very old couch : on which , with his legs much higher than his head , a man was reposing at full length , smoking a long clay pipe .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 30]: He was dressed in a smartly-cut snuff-coloured coat , with large brass buttons ; an orange neckerchief ; a coarse , staring , shawl-pattern waistcoat ; and drab breeches .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 57]: Mr. Crackit -LRB- for he it was -RRB- had no very great quantity of hair , either upon his head or face ; but what he had , was of a reddish dye , and tortured into long corkscrew curls , through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers , ornamented with large common rings .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 45]: He was a trifle above the middle size , and apparently rather weak in the legs ; but this circumstance by no means detracted from his own admiration of his top-boots , which he contemplated , in their elevated situation , with lively satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 7]: ` Bill , my boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 19]: said this figure , turning his head towards the door , ` I 'm glad to see you .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 21]: I was almost afraid you 'd given it up : in which case I should have made a personal wentur .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 3]: Hallo ! '
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 33]: Uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise , as his eyes rested on Oliver , Mr. Toby Crackit brought himself into a sitting posture , and demanded who that was .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 4]: ` The boy .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 5]: Only the boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 10]: replied Sikes , drawing a chair towards the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 16]: ` Wud of Bister Fagid 's lads , ' exclaimed Barney , with a grin .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 7]: ` Fagin 's , eh ! '
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 7]: exclaimed Toby , looking at Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 18]: ` Wot an inwalable boy that 'll make , for the old ladies ' pockets in chapels !
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 10]: His mug is a fortin ' to him . '
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 48]: ` There -- there 's enough of that , ' interposed Sikes , impatiently ; and stooping over his recumbant friend , he whispered a few words in his ear : at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely , and honoured Oliver with a long stare of astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 45]: ` Now , ' said Sikes , as he resumed his seat , ` if you 'll give us something to eat and drink while we 're waiting , you 'll put some heart in us ; or in me , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 31]: Sit down by the fire , younker , and rest yourself ; for you 'll have to go out with us again to-night , though not very far off . '
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 41]: Oliver looked at Sikes , in mute and timid wonder ; and drawing a stool to the fire , sat with his aching head upon his hands , scarecely knowing where he was , or what was passing around him .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 31]: ` Here , ' said Toby , as the young Jew placed some fragments of food , and a bottle upon the table , ` Success to the crack ! '
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 35]: He rose to honour the toast ; and , carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner , advanced to the table , filled a glass with spirits , and drank off its contents .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 7]: Mr. Sikes did the same . '
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 14]: A drain for the boy , ' said Toby , half-filling a wine-glass .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 8]: ` Down with it , innocence . '
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 28]: ` Indeed , ' said Oliver , looking piteously up into the man 's face ; ` indeed , I -- ' ` Down with it ! '
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 3]: echoed Toby .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 14]: ` Do you think I do n't know what 's good for you ?
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 9]: Tell him to drink it , Bill . '
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 6]: ` He had better ! '
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 9]: said Sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 18]: ` Burn my body , if he is n't more trouble than a whole family of Dodgers .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 11]: Drink it , you perwerse imp ; drink it ! '
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 47]: Frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men , Oliver hastily swallowed the contents of the glass , and immediately fell into a violent fit of coughing : which delighted Toby Crackit and Barney , and even drew a smile from the surly Mr. Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 40]: This done , and Sikes having satisfied his appetite -LRB- Oliver could eat nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow -RRB- , the two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 25]: Oliver retained his stool by the fire ; Barney wrapped in a blanket , stretched himself on the floor : close outside the fender .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 29]: They slept , or appeared to sleep , for some time ; nobody stirring but Barney , who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 52]: Oliver fell into a heavy doze : imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes , or wandering about the dark churchyard , or retracing some one or other of the scenes of the past day : when he was roused by Toby Crackit jumping up and declaring it was half-past one .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 21]: In an instant , the other two were on their legs , and all were actively engaged in busy preparation .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 39]: Sikes and his companion enveloped their necks and chins in large dark shawls , and drew on their great-coats ; Barney , opening a cupboard , brought forth several articles , which he hastily crammed into the pockets .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 12]: ` Barkers for me , Barney , ' said Toby Crackit .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 15]: ` Here they are , ' replied Barney , producing a pair of pistols .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 7]: ` You loaded them yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 5]: ` All right ! '
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 7]: replied Toby , stowing them away .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 5]: ` The persuaders ? '
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 10]: ` I 've got 'em , ' replied Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 13]: ` Crape , keys , centre-bits , darkies -- nothing forgotten ? '
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 17]: inquired Toby : fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 9]: ` All right , ' rejoined his companion .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 9]: ` Bring them bits of timber , Barney .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 8]: That 's the time of day . '
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 31]: With these words , he took a thick stick from Barney 's hands , who , having delivered another to Toby , busied himself in fastening on Oliver 's cape .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 5]: ` Now then ! '
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 8]: said Sikes , holding out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 38]: Oliver : who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise , and the air , and the drink which had been forced upon him : put his hand mechanically into that which Sikes extended for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 12]: ` Take his other hand , Toby , ' said Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 7]: ` Look out , Barney . '
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 16]: The man went to the door , and returned to announce that all was quiet .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 10]: The two robbers issued forth with Oliver between them .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 19]: Barney , having made all fast , rolled himself up as before , and was soon asleep again .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 6]: It was now intensely dark .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 58]: The fog was much heavier than it had been in the early part of the night ; and the atmosphere was so damp , that , although no rain fell , Oliver 's hair and eyebrows , within a few minutes after leaving the house , had become stiff with the half-frozen moisture that was floating about .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 17]: They crossed the bridge , and kept on towards the lights which he had seen before .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 22]: They were at no great distance off ; and , as they walked pretty briskly , they soon arrived at Chertsey .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 26]: ` Slap through the town , ' whispered Sikes ; ` there 'll be nobody in the way , to-night , to see us . '
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 24]: Toby acquiesced ; and they hurried through the main street of the little town , which at that late hour was wholly deserted .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 25]: A dim light shone at intervals from some bed-room window ; and the hoarse barking of dogs occasionally broke the silence of the night .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 6]: But there was nobody abroad .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 12]: They had cleared the town , as the church-bell struck two .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 14]: Quickening their pace , they turned up a road upon the left hand .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 40]: After walking about a quarter of a mile , they stopped before a detached house surrounded by a wall : to the top of which , Toby Crackit , scarcely pausing to take breath , climbed in a twinkling .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 9]: ` The boy next , ' said Toby .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 13]: ` Hoist him up ; I 'll catch hold of him . '
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 35]: Before Oliver had time to look round , Sikes had caught him under the arms ; and in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on the grass on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 4]: Sikes followed directly .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 8]: And they stole cautiously towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 34]: And now , for the first time , Oliver , well-nigh mad with grief and terror , saw that housebreaking and robbery , if not murder , were the objects of the expedition .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 15]: He clasped his hands together , and involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 28]: A mist came before his eyes ; the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face ; his limbs failed him ; and he sank upon his knees .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 5]: ` Get up ! '
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 30]: murmured Sikes , trembling with rage , and drawing the pistol from his pocket ; ` Get up , or I 'll strew your brains upon the grass . '
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 9]: for God 's sake let me go ! '
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 14]: cried Oliver ; ` let me run away and die in the fields .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 11]: I will never come near London ; never , never !
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 13]: pray have mercy on me , and do not make me steal .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 19]: For the love of all the bright Angels that rest in Heaven , have mercy upon me ! '
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 45]: The man to whom this appeal was made , swore a dreadful oath , and had cocked the pistol , when Toby , striking it from his grasp , placed his hand upon the boy 's mouth , and dragged him to the house .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 11]: cried the man ; ` it wo n't answer here .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 18]: Say another word , and I 'll do your business myself with a crack on the head .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 15]: That makes no noise , and is quite as certain , and more genteel .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 9]: Here , Bill , wrench the shutter open .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 10]: He 's game enough now , I 'll engage .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 25]: I 've seen older hands of his age took the same way , for a minute or two , on a cold night . '
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 27]: Sikes , invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin 's head for sending Oliver on such an errand , plied the crowbar vigorously , but with little noise .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 24]: After some delay , and some assistance from Toby , the shutter to which he had referred , swung open on its hinges .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 41]: It was a little lattice window , about five feet and a half above the ground , at the back of the house : which belonged to a scullery , or small brewing-place , at the end of the passage .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 38]: The aperture was so small , that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to defend it more securely ; but it was large enough to admit a boy of Oliver 's size , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 27]: A very brief exercise of Mr. Sike 's art , sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice ; and it soon stood wide open also .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 41]: ` Now listen , you young limb , ' whispered Sikes , drawing a dark lantern from his pocket , and throwing the glare full on Oliver 's face ; ` I 'm a going to put you through there .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 33]: Take this light ; go softly up the steps straight afore you , and along the little hall , to the street door ; unfasten it , and let us in . '
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 21]: ` There 's a bolt at the top , you wo n't be able to reach , ' interposed Toby .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 9]: ` Stand upon one of the hall chairs .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 28]: There are three there , Bill , with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on 'em : which is the old lady 's arms . '
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 9]: ` Keep quiet , ca n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 8]: replied Sikes , with a threatening look .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 10]: ` The room-door is open , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 14]: ` Wide , ' repied Toby , after peeping in to satisfy himself .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 42]: ` The game of that is , that they always leave it open with a catch , so that the dog , who 's got a bed in here , may walk up and down the passage when he feels wakeful .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 7]: Barney ` ticed him away to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 4]: So neat ! '
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 29]: Although Mr. Crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper , and laughed without noise , Sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent , and to get to work .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 48]: Toby complied , by first producing his lantern , and placing it on the ground ; then by planting himself firmly with his head against the wall beneath the window , and his hands upon his knees , so as to make a step of his back .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 41]: This was no sooner done , than Sikes , mounting upon him , put Oiver gently through the window with his feet first ; and , without leaving hold of his collar , planted him safely on the floor inside .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 14]: ` Take this lantern , ' said Sikes , looking into the room .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 9]: ` You see the stairs afore you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 14]: Oliver , more dead than alive , gasped out , ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 38]: Sikes , pointing to the street-door with the pistol-barrel , briefly advised him to take notice that he was within shot all the way ; and that if he faltered , he would fall dead that instant .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 18]: ` It 's done in a minute , ' said Sikes , in the same low whisper .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 12]: ` Directly I leave go of you , do your work .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 3]: Hark ! '
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 6]: ` What 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 5]: whispered the other man .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 4]: They listened intently .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 13]: ` Nothing , ' said Sikes , releasing his hold of Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 4]: ` Now ! '
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 45]: In the short time he had had to collect his senses , the boy had firmly resolved that , whether he died in the attempt or not , he would make one effort to dart upstairs from the hall , and alarm the family .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 13]: Filled with this idea , he advanced at once , but stealthiy .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 5]: ` Come back ! '
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 5]: suddenly cried Sikes aloud .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 3]: ` Back !
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 3]: back ! '
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 37]: Scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place , and by a loud cry which followed it , Oliver let his lantern fall , and knew not whether to advance or fly .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 53]: The cry was repeated -- a light appeared -- a vision of two terrified half-dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes -- a flash -- a loud noise -- a smoke -- a crash somewhere , but where he knew not , -- and he staggered back .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 26]: Sikes had disappeared for an instant ; but he was up again , and had him by the collar before the smoke had cleared away .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 20]: He fired his own pistol after the men , who were already retreating ; and dragged the boy up .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 18]: ` Clasp your arm tighter , ' said Sikes , as he drew him through the window .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 7]: ` Give me a shawl here .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 5]: They 've hit him .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 2]: Quick !
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 6]: How the boy bleeds ! '
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 36]: Then came the loud ringing of a bell , mingled with the noise of fire-arms , and the shouts of men , and the sensation of being carried over uneven ground at a rapid pace .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 31]: And then , the noises grew confused in the distance ; and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boy 's heart ; and he saw or heard no more .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 35]: CHAPTER XXIII WHICH CONTAINS THE SUBSTANCE OF A PLEASANT CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR. BUMBLE AND A LADY ; AND SHOWS THAT EVEN A BEADLE MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE ON SOME POINTS The night was bitter cold .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 72]: The snow lay on the ground , frozen into a hard thick crust , so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad : which , as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found , caught it savagely up in clouds , and , whirling it into a thousand misty eddies , scattered it in air .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 45]: Bleak , dark , and piercing cold , it was a night for the well-housed and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank God they were at home ; and for the homeless , starving wretch to lay him down and die .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 36]: Many hunger-worn outcasts close their eyes in our bare streets , at such times , who , let their crimes have been what they may , can hardly open them in a more bitter world .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 84]: Such was the aspect of out-of-doors affairs , when Mr. Corney , the matron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already introduced as the birthplace of Oliver Twist , sat herself down before a cheerful fire in her own little room , and glanced , with no small degree of complacency , at a small round table : on which stood a tray of corresponding size , furnished with all necessary materials for the most grateful meal that matrons enjoy .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 16]: In fact , Mrs. Corney was about to solace herself with a cup of tea .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 45]: As she glanced from the table to the fireplace , where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a small song in a small voice , her inward satisfaction evidently increased , -- so much so , indeed , that Mrs. Corney smiled .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 35]: said the matron , leaning her elbow on the table , and looking reflectively at the fire ; ` I 'm sure we have all on us a great deal to be grateful for !
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 11]: A great deal , if we did but know it .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 3]: Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 47]: Mrs. Corney shook her head mournfully , as if deploring the mental blindness of those paupers who did not know it ; and thrusting a silver spoon -LRB- private property -RRB- into the inmost recesses of a two-ounce tin tea-caddy , proceeded to make the tea .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 13]: How slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds !
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 29]: The black teapot , being very small and easily filled , ran over while Mrs. Corney was moralising ; and the water slightly scalded Mrs. Corney 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 6]: ` Drat the pot ! '
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 28]: said the worthy matron , setting it down very hastily on the hob ; ' a little stupid thing , that only holds a couple of cups !
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 9]: What use is it of , to anybody !
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 19]: Except , ' said Mrs. Corney , pausing , ` except to a poor desolate creature like me .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 4]: Oh dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 28]: With these words , the matron dropped into her chair , and , once more resting her elbow on the table , thought of her solitary fate .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 37]: The small teapot , and the single cup , had awakened in her mind sad recollections of Mr. Corney -LRB- who had not been dead more than five-and-twenty years -RRB- ; and she was overpowered . '
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 7]: I shall never get another ! '
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 17]: said Mrs. Corney , pettishly ; ' I shall never get another -- like him . '
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 16]: Whether this remark bore reference to the husband , or the teapot , is uncertain .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 23]: It might have been the latter ; for Mrs. Corney looked at it as she spoke ; and took it up afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 20]: She had just tasted her first cup , when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the room-door .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 9]: ` Oh , come in with you ! '
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 6]: said Mrs. Corney , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 11]: ` Some of the old women dying , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 9]: They always die when I 'm at meals .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 14]: Do n't stand there , letting the cold air in , do n't .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 8]: What 's amiss now , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 14]: ` Nothing , ma'am , nothing , ' replied a man 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 17]: exclaimed the matron , in a much sweeter tone , ` is that Mr. Bumble ? '
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 53]: ` At your service , ma'am , ' said Mr. Bumble , who had been stopping outside to rub his shoes clean , and to shake the snow off his coat ; and who now made his appearance , bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a bundle in the other .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 10]: ` Shall I shut the door , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 25]: The lady modestly hesitated to reply , lest there should be any impropriety in holding an interview with Mr. Bumble , with closed doors .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 19]: Mr. Bumble taking advantage of the hesitation , and being very cold himself , shut it without permission .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 12]: ` Hard weather , Mr. Bumble , ' said the matron .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 12]: ` Hard , indeed , ma'am , ' replied the beadle .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 7]: ` Anti-porochial weather this , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 39]: We have given away , Mrs. Corney , we have given away a matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half , this very blessed afternoon ; and yet them paupers are not contented . '
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 5]: ` Of course not .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 9]: When would they be , Mr. Bumble ? '
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 8]: said the matron , sipping her tea .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 8]: ` When , indeed , ma'am ! '
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 4]: rejoined Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 31]: ` Why here 's one man that , in consideraton of his wife and large family , has a quartern loaf and a good pound of cheese , full weight .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 6]: Is he grateful , ma'am ?
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 4]: Is he grateful ?
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 9]: Not a copper farthing 's worth of it !
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 26]: What does he do , ma'am , but ask for a few coals ; if it 's only a pocket handkerchief full , he says !
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 2]: Coals !
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 7]: What would he do with coals ?
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 12]: Toast his cheese with 'em and then come back for more .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 38]: That 's the way with these people , ma'am ; give 'em a apron full of coals to-day , and they 'll come back for another , the day after to-morrow , as brazen as alabaster . '
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 18]: The matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible simile ; and the beadle went on . '
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 19]: I never , ' said Mr. Bumble , ` see anything like the pitch it 's got to .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 71]: The day afore yesterday , a man -- you have been a married woman , ma'am , and I may mention it to you -- a man , with hardly a rag upon his back -LRB- here Mrs. Corney looked at the floor -RRB- , goes to our overseer 's door when he has got company coming to dinner ; and says , he must be relieved , Mrs. Corney .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 30]: As he would n't go away , and shocked the company very much , our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 5]: `` My heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 15]: says the ungrateful villain , `` what 's the use of THIS to me ?
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 13]: You might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles ! '
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 24]: `` Very good , '' says our overseer , taking 'em away again , `` you wo n't get anything else here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 10]: `` Then I 'll die in the streets ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 4]: says the vagrant .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 14]: `` Oh no , you wo n't , '' says our overseer . '
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 3]: ` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 5]: That was very good !
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 10]: So like Mr. Grannett , was n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 4]: interposed the matron .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 7]: ` Well , Mr. Bumble ? '
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 23]: ` Well , ma'am , ' rejoined the beadle , ` he went away ; and he DID die in the streets .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 9]: There 's a obstinate pauper for you ! '
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 15]: ` It beats anything I could have believed , ' observed the matron emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 19]: ` But do n't you think out-of-door relief a very bad thing , any way , Mr. Bumble ?
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 12]: You 're a gentleman of experience , and ought to know .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 3]: Come . '
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 34]: ` Mrs. Corney , ' said the beadle , smiling as men smile who are conscious of superior information , ` out-of-door relief , properly managed , ma'am : is the porochial safeguard .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 28]: The great principle of out-of-door relief is , to give the paupers exactly what they do n't want ; and then they get tired of coming . '
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs. Corney .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 12]: ` Well , that is a good one , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 54]: Betwixt you and me , ma'am , ' returned Mr. Bumble , ` that 's the great principle ; and that 's the reason why , if you look at any cases that get into them owdacious newspapers , you 'll always observe that sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 14]: That 's the rule now , Mrs. Corney , all over the country .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 45]: But , however , ' said the beadle , stopping to unpack his bundle , ` these are official secrets , ma'am ; not to be spoken of ; except , as I may say , among the porochial officers , such as ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 42]: This is the port wine , ma'am , that the board ordered for the infirmary ; real , fresh , genuine port wine ; only out of the cask this forenoon ; clear as a bell , and no sediment ! '
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 60]: Having held the first bottle up to the light , and shaken it well to test its excellence , Mr. Bumble placed them both on top of a chest of drawers ; folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped ; put it carefully in his pocket ; and took up his hat , as if to go .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 17]: ` You 'll have a very cold walk , Mr. Bumble , ' said the matron .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 26]: ` It blows , ma'am , ' replied Mr. Bumble , turning up his coat-collar , ` enough to cut one 's ears off . '
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 46]: The matron looked , from the little kettle , to the beadle , who was moving towards the door ; and as the beadle coughed , preparatory to bidding her good-night , bashfully inquired whether -- whether he would n't take a cup of tea ?
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 27]: Mr. Bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again ; laid his hat and stick upon a chair ; and drew another chair up to the table .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 12]: As he slowly seated himself , he looked at the lady .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 9]: She fixed her eyes upon the little teapot .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 9]: Mr. Bumble coughed again , and slightly smiled .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 13]: Mrs. Corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 30]: As she sat down , her eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle ; she coloured , and applied herself to the task of making his tea .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 14]: Again Mr. Bumble coughed -- louder this time than he had coughed yet .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 3]: ` Sweet ?
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 4]: Mr. Bumble ? '
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 9]: inquired the matron , taking up the sugar-basin .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 13]: ` Very sweet , indeed , ma'am , ' replied Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 29]: He fixed his eyes on Mrs. Corney as he said this ; and if ever a beadle looked tender , Mr. Bumble was that beadle at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 10]: The tea was made , and handed in silence .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 71]: Mr. Bumble , having spread a handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the splendour of his shorts , began to eat and drink ; varying these amusements , occasionally , by fetching a deep sigh ; which , however , had no injurious effect upon his appetite , but , on the contrary , rather seemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 44]: ` You have a cat , ma'am , I see , ' said Mr. Bumble , glancing at one who , in the centre of her family , was basking before the fire ; ` and kittens too , I declare ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 20]: I am so fond of them , Mr. Bumble , you ca n't think , ' replied the matron .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 22]: ` They 're SO happy , SO frolicsome , and SO cheerful , that they are quite companions for me . '
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 20]: ` Very nice animals , ma'am , ' replied Mr. Bumble , approvingly ; ` so very domestic . '
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 6]: ` Oh , yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 26]: rejoined the matron with enthusiasm ; ` so fond of their home too , that it 's quite a pleasure , I 'm sure . '
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 60]: ` Mrs. Corney , ma'am , said Mr. Bumble , slowly , and marking the time with his teaspoon , ' I mean to say this , ma'am ; that any cat , or kitten , that could live with you , ma'am , and NOT be fond of its home , must be a ass , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 7]: ` Oh , Mr. Bumble ! '
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 4]: remonstrated Mrs. Corney .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 43]: ` It 's of no use disguising facts , ma'am , ' said Mr. Bumble , slowly flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him doubly impressive ; ' I would drown it myself , with pleasure . '
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 35]: ` Then you 're a cruel man , ' said the matron vivaciously , as she held out her hand for the beadle 's cup ; ` and a very hard-hearted man besides . '
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 6]: ` Hard-hearted , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 4]: said Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 4]: ` Hard ? '
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 48]: Mr. Bumble resigned his cup without another word ; squeezed Mrs. Corney 's little finger as she took it ; and inflicting two open-handed slaps upon his laced waistcoat , gave a mighty sigh , and hitched his chair a very little morsel farther from the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 184]: It was a round table ; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been sitting opposite each other , with no great space between them , and fronting the fire , it will be seen that Mr. Bumble , in receding from the fire , and still keeping at the table , increased the distance between himself and Mrs. Corney ; which proceeding , some prudent readers will doubtless be disposed to admire , and to consider an act of great heroism on Mr. Bumble 's part : he being in some sort tempted by time , place , and opportunity , to give utterance to certain soft nothings , which however well they may become the lips of the light and thoughtless , do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the land , members of parliament , ministers of state , lord mayors , and other great public functionaries , but more particularly beneath the stateliness and gravity of a beadle : who -LRB- as is well known -RRB- should be the sternest and most inflexible among them all .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 92]: Whatever were Mr. Bumble 's intentions , however -LRB- and no doubt they were of the best -RRB- : it unfortunately happened , as has been twice before remarked , that the table was a round one ; consequently Mr. Bumble , moving his chair by little and little , soon began to diminish the distance between himself and the matron ; and , continuing to travel round the outer edge of the circle , brought his chair , in time , close to that in which the matron was seated .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 17]: Indeed , the two chairs touched ; and when they did so , Mr. Bumble stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 70]: Now , if the matron had moved her chair to the right , she would have been scorched by the fire ; and if to the left , she must have fallen into Mr. Bumble 's arms ; so -LRB- being a discreet matron , and no doubt foreseeing these consequences at a glance -RRB- she remained where she was , and handed Mr. Bumble another cup of tea .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 7]: ` Hard-hearted , Mrs. Corney ? '
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 26]: said Mr. Bumble , stirring his tea , and looking up into the matron 's face ; ` are YOU hard-hearted , Mrs. Corney ? '
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 15]: exclaimed the matron , ` what a very curious question from a single man .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 12]: What can you want to know for , Mr. Bumble ? '
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 33]: The beadle drank his tea to the last drop ; finished a piece of toast ; whisked the crumbs off his knees ; wiped his lips ; and deliberately kissed the matron .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 5]: ` Mr. Bumble ! '
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 32]: cried that discreet lady in a whisper ; for the fright was so great , that she had quite lost her voice , ` Mr. Bumble , I shall scream ! '
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 23]: Mr. Bumble made no reply ; but in a slow and dignified manner , put his arm round the matron 's waist .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 73]: As the lady had stated her intention of screaming , of course she would have screamed at this additional boldness , but that the exertion was rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door : which was no sooner heard , than Mr. Bumble darted , with much agility , to the wine bottles , and began dusting them with great violence : while the matron sharply demanded who was there .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 37]: It is worthy of remark , as a curious physical instance of the efficacy of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear , that her voice had quite recovered all its official asperity .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 34]: ` If you please , mistress , ' said a withered old female pauper , hideously ugly : putting her head in at the door , ` Old Sally is a-going fast . '
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 10]: ` Well , what 's that to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 6]: angrily demanded the matron . '
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 11]: I ca n't keep her alive , can I ? '
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 26]: ` No , no , mistress , ' replied the old woman , ` nobody can ; she 's far beyond the reach of help .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 26]: I 've seen a many people die ; little babes and great strong men ; and I know when death 's a-coming , well enough .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 46]: But she 's troubled in her mind : and when the fits are not on her , -- and that 's not often , for she is dying very hard , -- she says she has got something to tell , which you must hear .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 12]: She 'll never die quiet till you come , mistress . '
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 58]: At this intelligence , the worthy Mrs. Corney muttered a variety of invectives against old women who could n't even die without purposely annoying their betters ; and , muffling herself in a thick shawl which she hastily caught up , briefly requested Mr. Bumble to stay till she came back , lest anything particular should occur .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 33]: Bidding the messenger walk fast , and not be all night hobbling up the stairs , she followed her from the room with a very ill grace , scolding all the way .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 14]: Mr. Bumble 's conduct on being left to himself , was rather inexplicable .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 57]: He opened the closet , counted the teaspoons , weighed the sugar-tongs , closely inspected a silver milk-pot to ascertain that it was of the genuine metal , and , having satisfied his curiosity on these points , put on his cocked hat corner-wise , and danced with much gravity four distinct times round the table .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 43]: Having gone through this very extraordinary performance , he took off the cocked hat again , and , spreading himself before the fire with his back towards it , seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact inventory of the furniture .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 9]: CHAPTER XXIV TREATS ON A VERY POOR SUBJECT .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 34]: BUT IS A SHORT ONE , AND MAY BE FOUND OF IMPORTANCE IN THIS HISTORY It was no unfit messanger of death , who had disturbed the quiet of the matron 's room .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 40]: Her body was bent by age ; her limbs trembled with palsy ; her face , distorted into a mumbling leer , resembled more the grotesque shaping of some wild pencil , than the work of Nature 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 16]: How few of Nature 's faces are left alone to gladden us with their beauty !
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 51]: The cares , and sorrows , and hungerings , of the world , change them as they change hearts ; and it is only when those passions sleep , and have lost their hold for ever , that the troubled clouds pass off , and leave Heaven 's surface clear .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 78]: It is a common thing for the countenances of the dead , even in that fixed and rigid state , to subside into the long-forgotten expression of sleeping infancy , and settle into the very look of early life ; so calm , so peaceful , do they grow again , that those who knew them in their happy childhood , kneel by the coffin 's side in awe , and see the Angel even upon earth .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 67]: The old crone tottered alone the passages , and up the stairs , muttering some indistinct answers to the chidings of her companion ; being at length compelled to pause for breath , she gave the light into her hand , and remained behind to follow as she might : while the more nimble superior made her way to the room where the sick woman lay .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 16]: It was a bare garret-room , with a dim light burning at the farther end .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 29]: There was another old woman watching by the bed ; the parish apothecary 's apprentice was standing by the fire , making a toothpick out of a quill .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 18]: ` Cold night , Mrs. Corney , ' said this young gentleman , as the matron entered .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 27]: ` Very cold , indeed , sir , ' replied the mistress , in her most civil tones , and dropping a curtsey as she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 48]: ` You should get better coals out of your contractors , ' said the apothecary 's deputy , breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the rusty poker ; ` these are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night . '
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 15]: ` They 're the board 's choosing , sir , ' returned the matron .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 23]: ` The least they could do , would be to keep us pretty warm : for our places are hard enough . '
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 13]: The conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 33]: said the young mag , turning his face towards the bed , as if he had previously quite forgotten the patient , ` it 's all U.P. there , Mrs. Corney . '
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 10]: ` It is , is it , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 4]: asked the matron .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 15]: ` If she lasts a couple of hours , I shall be surprised . '
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 13]: said the apothecary 's apprentice , intent upon the toothpick 's point .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 10]: ` It 's a break-up of the system altogether .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 8]: Is she dozing , old lady ? '
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 16]: The attendant stooped over the bed , to ascertain ; and nodded in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 25]: ` Then perhaps she 'll go off in that way , if you do n't make a row , ' said the young man .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 8]: ` Put the light on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 8]: She wo n't see it there . '
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 47]: The attendant did as she was told : shaking her head meanwhile , to intimate that the woman would not die so easily ; having done so , she resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse , who had by this time returned .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 24]: The mistress , with an expression of impatience , wrapped herself in her shawl , and sat at the foot of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 54]: The apothecary 's apprentice , having completed the manufacture of the toothpick , planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it for ten minutes or so : when apparently growing rather dull , he wished Mrs. Corney joy of her job , and took himself off on tiptoe .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 35]: When they had sat in silence for some time , the two old women rose from the bed , and crouching over the fire , held out their withered hands to catch the heat .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 33]: The flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled faces , and made their ugliness appear terrible , as , in this position , they began to converse in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 16]: ` Did she say any more , Anny dear , while I was gone ? '
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 4]: inquired the messenger .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 10]: ` Not a word , ' replied the other .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 25]: ` She plucked and tore at her arms for a little time ; but I held her hands , and she soon dropped off .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 15]: She has n't much strength in her , so I easily kept her quiet .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 22]: I ai n't so weak for an old woman , although I am on parish allowance ; no , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 16]: ` Did she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have ? '
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 5]: demanded the first . '
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 12]: I tried to get it down , ' rejoined the other .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 30]: ` But her teeth were tight set , and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as I could do to get it back again .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 12]: So I drank it ; and it did me good ! '
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 26]: Looking cautiously round , to ascertain that they were not overheard , the two hags cowered nearer to the fire , and chuckled heartily . '
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 29]: I mind the time , ' said the first speaker , ` when she would have done the same , and made rare fun of it afterwards . '
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 19]: ` Ay , that she would , ' rejoined the other ; ` she had a merry heart .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 18]: A many , many , beautiful corpses she laid out , as nice and neat as waxwork .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 28]: My old eyes have seen them -- ay , and those old hands touched them too ; for I have helped her , scores of times . '
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 56]: Stretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke , the old creature shook them exultingly before her face , and fumbling in her pocket , brought out an old time-discoloured tin snuff-box , from which she shook a few grains into the outstretched palm of her companion , and a few more into her own .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 40]: While they were thus employed , the matron , who had been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her stupor , joined them by the fire , and sharply asked how long she was to wait ?
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 18]: ` Not long , mistress , ' replied the second woman , looking up into her face .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 12]: ` We have none of us long to wait for Death .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 4]: Patience , patience !
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 11]: He 'll be here soon enough for us all . '
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 10]: ` Hold your tongue , you doting idiot ! '
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 5]: said the matron sternly .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 17]: ` You , Martha , tell me ; has she been in this way before ? '
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 9]: ` Often , ' answered the first woman .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 38]: ` But will never be again , ' added the second one ; ` that is , she 'll never wake again but once -- and mind , mistress , that wo n't be for long ! '
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 39]: ` Long or short , ' said the matron , snappishly , ` she wo n't find me here when she does wake ; take care , both of you , how you worry me again for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 27]: It 's no part of my duty to see all the old women in the house die , and I wo n't -- that 's more .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 8]: Mind that , you impudent old harridans .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 20]: If you make a fool of me again , I 'll soon cure you , I warrant you ! '
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 26]: She was bouncing away , when a cry from the two women , who had turned towards the bed , caused her to look round .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 15]: The patient had raised herself upright , and was stretching her arms towards them .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 6]: ` Who 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 8]: she cried , in a hollow voice .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 6]: ` Hush , hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 10]: said one of the women , stooping over her .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 8]: ` Lie down , lie down ! '
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 10]: ` I 'll never lie down again alive ! '
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 7]: said the woman , struggling . '
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 5]: I WILL tell her !
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 3]: Come here !
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 2]: Nearer !
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 8]: Let me whisper in your ear . '
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 44]: She clutched the matron by the arm , and forcing her into a chair by the bedside , was about to speak , when looking round , she caught sight of the two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 16]: ` Turn them away , ' said the woman , drowsily ; ` make haste !
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 4]: make haste ! '
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 60]: The two old crones , chiming in together , began pouring out many piteous lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best friends ; and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never leave her , when the superior pushed them from the room , closed the door , and returned to the bedside .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 77]: On being excluded , the old ladies changed their tone , and cried through the keyhole that old Sally was drunk ; which , indeed , was not unlikely ; since , in addition to a moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary , she was labouring under the effects of a final taste of gin-and-water which had been privily administered , in the openness of their hearts , by the worthy old ladies themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 27]: ` Now listen to me , ' said the dying woman aloud , as if making a great effort to revive one latent spark of energy .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 43]: ` In this very room -- in this very bed -- I once nursed a pretty young creetur ' , that was brought into the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking , and all soiled with dust and blood .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 10]: She gave birth to a boy , and died .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 11]: Let me think -- what was the year again ! '
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 18]: ` Never mind the year , ' said the impatient auditor ; ` what about her ? '
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 21]: ` Ay , ' murmured the sick woman , relapsing into her former drowsy state , ` what about her ?
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 8]: -- what about -- I know ! '
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 28]: she cried , jumping fiercely up : her face flushed , and her eyes starting from her head -- ' I robbed her , so I did !
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 19]: She was n't cold -- I tell you she was n't cold , when I stole it ! '
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 10]: ` Stole what , for God 's sake ? '
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 15]: cried the matron , with a gesture as if she would call for help .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 4]: ` IT ! '
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 13]: replied the woman , laying her hand over the other 's mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 7]: ` The only thing she had .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 27]: She wanted clothes to keep her warm , and food to eat ; but she had kept it safe , and had it in her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 8]: It was gold , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 11]: Rich gold , that might have saved her life ! '
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 4]: ` Gold ! '
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 14]: echoed the matron , bending eagerly over the woman as she fell back .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 13]: ` Go on , go on -- yest -- what of it ?
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 5]: Who was the mother ?
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 5]: When was it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 28]: ` She charge me to keep it safe , ' replied the woman with a groan , ` and trusted me as the only woman about her .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 30]: I stole it in my heart when she first showed it me hanging round her neck ; and the child 's death , perhaps , is on me besides !
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 15]: They would have treated him better , if they had known it all ! '
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 5]: ` Known what ? '
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 4]: asked the other .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 4]: ` Speak ! '
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 36]: ` The boy grew so like his mother , ' said the woman , rambling on , and not heeding the question , ` that I could never forget it when I saw his face .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 3]: Poor girl !
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 3]: poor girl !
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 7]: She was so young , too !
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 5]: Such a gentle lamb !
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 8]: Wait ; there 's more to tell .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 11]: I have not told you all , have I ? '
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 28]: ` No , no , ' replied the matron , inclining her head to catch the words , as they came more faintly from the dying woman .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 12]: ` Be quick , or it may be too late ! '
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 66]: ` The mother , ' said the woman , making a more violent effort than before ; ` the mother , when the pains of death first came upon her , whispered in my ear that if her baby was born alive , and thrived , the day might come when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother named .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 8]: `` And oh , kind Heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 44]: she said , folding her thin hands together , `` whether it be boy or girl , raise up some friends for it in this troubled world , and take pity upon a lonely desolate child , abandoned to its mercy ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 7]: ` The boy 's name ? '
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 4]: demanded the matron .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 13]: ` They CALLED him Oliver , ' replied the woman , feebly .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 16]: ` The gold I stole was -- ' ` Yes , yes -- what ? '
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 4]: cried the other .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 57]: She was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply ; but drew back , instinctively , as she once again rose , slowly and stiffly , into a sitting posture ; then , clutching the coverlid with both hands , muttered some indistinct sounds in her throat , and fell lifeless on the bed .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 12]: * * * * * * * ` Stone dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 17]: said one of the old women , hurrying in as soon as the door was opened .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 18]: ` And nothing to tell , after all , ' rejoined the matron , walking carelessly away .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 32]: The two crones , to all appearance , too busily occupied in the preparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply , were left alone , hovering about the body .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 49]: CHAPTER XXV WHEREIN THIS HISTORY REVERTS TO MR. FAGIN AND COMPANY While these things were passing in the country workhouse , Mr. Fagin sat in the old den -- the same from which Oliver had been removed by the girl -- brooding over a dull , smoky fire .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 60]: He held a pair of bellows upon his knee , with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it into more cheerful action ; but he had fallen into deep thought ; and with his arms folded on them , and his chin resting on his thumbs , fixed his eyes , abstractedly , on the rusty bars .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 37]: At a table behind him sat the Artful Dodger , Master Charles Bates , and Mr. Chitling : all intent upon a game of whist ; the Artful taking dummy against Master Bates and Mr. Chitling .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 72]: The countenance of the first-named gentleman , peculiarly intelligent at all times , acquired great additional interest from his close observance of the game , and his attentive perusal of Mr. Chitling 's hand ; upon which , from time to time , as occasion served , he bestowed a variety of earnest glances : wisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon his neighbour 's cards .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 23]: It being a cold night , the Dodger wore his hat , as , indeed , was often his custom within doors .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 48]: He also sustained a clay pipe between his teeth , which he only removed for a brief space when he deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot upon the table , which stood ready filled with gin-and-water for the accommodation of the company .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 51]: Master Bates was also attentive to the play ; but being of a more excitable nature than his accomplished friend , it was observable that he more frequently applied himself to the gin-and-water , and moreover indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks , all highly unbecoming a scientific rubber .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 86]: Indeed , the Artful , presuming upon their close attachment , more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his companion upon these improprieties ; all of which remonstrances , Master Bates received in extremely good part ; merely requesting his friend to be ` blowed , ' or to insert his head in a sack , or replying with some other neatly-turned witticism of a similar kind , the happy application of which , excited considerable admiration in the mind of Mr. Chitling .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 63]: It was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably lost ; and that the circumstance , so far from angering Master Bates , appeared to afford him the highest amusement , inasmuch as he laughed most uproariously at the end of every deal , and protested that he had never seen such a jolly game in all his born days .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 29]: ` That 's two doubles and the rub , ' said Mr. Chitling , with a very long face , as he drew half-a-crown from his waistcoat-pocket . '
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 15]: I never see such a feller as you , Jack ; you win everything .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 18]: Even when we 've good cards , Charley and I ca n't make nothing of 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 45]: Either the master or the manner of this remark , which was made very ruefully , delighted Charley Bates so much , that his consequent shout of laughter roused the Jew from his reverie , and induced him to inquire what was the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 6]: ` Matter , Fagin ! '
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 4]: cried Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 8]: I wish you had watched the play .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 21]: Tommy Chitling has n't won a point ; and I went partners with him against the Artfull and dumb . '
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 6]: ` Ay , ay ! '
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 22]: said the Jew , with a grin , which sufficiently demonstrated that he was at no loss to understand the reason .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 12]: ` Try 'em again , Tom ; try 'em again . '
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 25]: ` No more of it for me , thank ` ee , Fagin , ' replied Mr. Chitling ; ` I 've had enough .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 20]: That ` ere Dodger has such a run of luck that there 's no standing again ' him . '
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 3]: ` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 26]: my dear , ' replied the Jew , ` you must get up very early in the morning , to win against the Dodger . '
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 4]: ` Morning ! '
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 37]: said Charley Bates ; ` you must put your boots on over-night , and have a telescope at each eye , and a opera-glass between your shoulders , if you want to come over him . '
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 31]: Mr. Dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy , and offered to cut any gentleman in company , for the first picture-card , at a shilling at a time .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 51]: Nobody accepting the challenge , and his pipe being by this time smoked out , he proceeded to amuse himself by sketching a ground-plan of Newgate on the table with the piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters ; whistling , meantime , with peculiar shrillness .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 10]: ` How precious dull you are , Tommy ! '
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 19]: said the Dodger , stopping short when there had been a long silence ; and addressing Mr. Chitling .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 13]: ` What do you think he 's thinking of , Fagin ? '
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 10]: ` How should I know , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 12]: replied the Jew , looking round as he plied the bellows .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 22]: ` About his losses , maybe ; or the little retirement in the country that he 's just left , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 8]: Is that it , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 25]: ` Not a bit of it , ' replied the Dodger , stopping the subject of discourse as Mr. Chitling was about to reply .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 10]: ` What do YOU say , Charley ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 22]: I should say , ' replied Master Bates , with a grin , ` that he was uncommon sweet upon Betsy .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 6]: See how he 's a-blushing !
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 5]: Oh , my eye !
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 5]: here 's a merry-go-rounder !
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 6]: Tommy Chitling 's in love !
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 6]: Oh , Fagin , Fagin !
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 5]: what a spree ! '
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 74]: Thoroughly overpowered with the notion of Mr. Chitling being the victim of the tender passion , Master Bates threw himself back in his chair with such violence , that he lost his balance , and pitched over upon the floor ; where -LRB- the accident abating nothing of his merriment -RRB- he lay at full length until his laugh was over , when he resumed his former position , and began another laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 32]: ` Never mind him , my dear , ' said the Jew , winking at Mr. Dawkins , and giving Master Bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 7]: ` Betsy 's a fine girl .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 7]: Stick up to her , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 6]: Stick up to her . '
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 33]: ` What I mean to say , Fagin , ' replied Mr. Chitling , very red in the face , ` is , that that is n't anything to anybody here . '
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 16]: ` No more it is , ' replied the Jew ; ` Charley will talk .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 13]: Do n't mind him , my dear ; do n't mind him .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 6]: Betsy 's a fine girl .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 16]: Do as she bids you , Tom , and you will make your fortune . '
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 32]: ` So I DO do as she bids me , ' replied Mr. Chitling ; ' I should n't have been milled , if it had n't been for her advice .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 16]: But it turned out a good job for you ; did n't it , Fagin !
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 8]: And what 's six weeks of it ?
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 33]: It must come , some time or another , and why not in the winter time when you do n't want to go out a-walking so much ; eh , Fagin ? '
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 15]: ` Ah , to be sure , my dear , ' replied the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 34]: ` You would n't mind it again , Tom , would you , ' asked the Dodger , winking upon Charley and the Jew , ` if Bet was all right ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 15]: I mean to say that I should n't , ' replied Tom , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 5]: ` There , now .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 19]: Who 'll say as much as that , I should like to know ; eh , Fagin ? '
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 18]: ` Nobody , my dear , ' replied the Jew ; ` not a soul , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 24]: I do n't know one of 'em that would do it besides you ; not one of 'em , my dear . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 21]: I might have got clear off , if I 'd split upon her ; might n't I , Fagin ? '
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 8]: angrily pursued the poor half-witted dupe . '
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 16]: A word from me would have done it ; would n't it , Fagin ? '
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 15]: ` To be sure it would , my dear , ' replied the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 14]: ` But I did n't blab it ; did I , Fagin ? '
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 11]: demanded Tom , pouring question upon question with great volubility .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 22]: ` No , no , to be sure , ' replied the Jew ; ` you were too stout-hearted for that .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 9]: A deal too stout , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 32]: ` Perhaps I was , ' rejoined Tom , looking round ; ` and if I was , what 's to laugh at , in that ; eh , Fagin ? '
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 38]: The Jew , perceiving that Mr. Chitling was considerably roused , hastened to assure him that nobody was laughing ; and to prove the gravity of the company , appealed to Master Bates , the principal offender .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 113]: But , unfortunately , Charley , in opening his mouth to reply that he was never more serious in his life , was unable to prevent the escape of such a violent roar , that the abused Mr. Chitling , without any preliminary ceremonies , rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender ; who , being skilful in evading pursuit , ducked to avoid it , and chose his time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old gentleman , and caused him to stagger to the wall , where he stood panting for breath , while Mr. Chitling looked on in intense dismay .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 4]: ` Hark ! '
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 14]: cried the Dodger at this moment , ' I heard the tinkler . '
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 10]: Catching up the light , he crept softly upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 17]: The bell was rung again , with some impatience , while the party were in darkness .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 14]: After a short pause , the Dodger reappeared , and whispered Fagin mysteriously .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 4]: ` What ! '
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 8]: cried the Jew , ` alone ? '
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 40]: The Dodger nodded in the affirmative , and , shading the flame of the candle with his hand , gave Charley Bates a private intimation , in dumb show , that he had better not be funny just then .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 21]: Having performed this friendly office , he fixed his eyes on the Jew 's face , and awaited his directions .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 35]: The old man bit his yellow fingers , and meditated for some seconds ; his face working with agitation the while , as if he dreaded something , and feared to know the worst .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 7]: At length he raised his head .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 6]: ` Where is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 20]: The Dodger pointed to the floor above , and made a gesture , as if to leave the room .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 18]: ` Yes , ' said the Jew , answering the mute inquiry ; ` bring him down .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 4]: Quiet , Charley !
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 4]: Gently , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 5]: Scarce , scarce ! '
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 18]: This brief direction to Charley Bates , and his recent antagonist , was softly and immediately obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 76]: There was no sound of their whereabout , when the Dodger descended the stairs , bearing the light in his hand , and followed by a man in a coarse smock-frock ; who , after casting a hurried glance round the room , pulled off a large wrapper which had concealed the lower portion of his face , and disclosed : all haggard , unwashed , and unshorn : the features of flash Toby Crackit .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 8]: ` How are you , Faguey ? '
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 9]: said this worthy , nodding to the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 31]: ` Pop that shawl away in my castor , Dodger , so that I may know where to find it when I cut ; that 's the time of day !
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 14]: You 'll be a fine young cracksman afore the old file now . '
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 32]: With these words he pulled up the smock-frock ; and , winding it round his middle , drew a chair to the fire , and placed his feet upon the hob .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 39]: ` See there , Faguey , ' he said , pointing disconsolately to his top boots ; ` not a drop of Day and Martin since you know when ; not a bubble of blacking , by Jove !
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 12]: But do n't look at me in that way , man .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 5]: All in good time .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 34]: I ca n't talk about business till I 've eat and drank ; so produce the sustainance , and let 's have a quiet fill-out for the first time these three days ! '
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 29]: The Jew motioned to the Dodger to place what eatables there were , upon the table ; and , seating himself opposite the housebreaker , waited his leisure .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 18]: To judge from appearances , Toby was by no means in a hurry to open the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 32]: At first , the Jew contented himself with patiently watching his countenance , as if to gain from its expression some clue to the intelligence he brought ; but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 45]: He looked tired and worn , but there was the same complacent repose upon his features that they always wore : and through dirt , and beard , and whisker , there still shone , unimpaired , the self-satisfied smirk of flash Toby Crackit .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 32]: Then the Jew , in an agony of impatience , watched every morsel he put into his mouth ; pacing up and down the room , meanwhile , in irrepressible excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 7]: It was all of no use .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 43]: Toby continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference , until he could eat no more ; then , ordering the Dodger out , he closed the door , mixed a glass of spirits and water , and composed himself for talking .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 11]: ` First and foremost , Faguey , ' said Toby .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 6]: ` Yes , yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 9]: interposed the Jew , drawing up his chair .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 48]: Mr. Crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water , and to declare that the gin was excellent ; then placing his feet against the low mantelpiece , so as to bring his boots to about the level of his eye , he quietly resumed .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 18]: ` First and foremost , Faguey , ' said the housebreaker , ` how 's Bill ? '
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 4]: ` What ! '
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 9]: screamed the Jew , starting from his seat .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 17]: ` Why , you do n't mean to say -- ' began Toby , turning pale .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 4]: ` Mean ! '
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 10]: cried the Jew , stamping furiously on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 5]: ` Where are they ?
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 5]: Sikes and the boy !
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 4]: Where are they ?
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 5]: Where have they been ?
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 5]: Where are they hiding ?
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 8]: Why have they not been here ? '
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 11]: ` The crack failed , ' said Toby faintly . '
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 20]: I know it , ' replied the Jew , tearing a newspaper from his pocket and pointing to it .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 5]: ` What more ? '
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 8]: ` They fired and hit the boy .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 25]: We cut over the fields at the back , with him between us -- straight as the crow flies -- through hedge and ditch .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 4]: They gave chase .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 2]: Damme !
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 13]: the whole country was awake , and the dogs upon us . '
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 5]: ` The boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 14]: ` Bill had him on his back , and scudded like the wind .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 18]: We stopped to take him between us ; his head hung down , and he was cold .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 18]: They were close upon our heels ; every man for himself , and each from the gallows !
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 13]: We parted company , and left the youngster lying in a ditch .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 13]: Alive or dead , that 's all I know about him . '
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 32]: The Jew stopped to hear no more ; but uttering a loud yell , and twining his hands in his hair , rushed from the room , and from the house .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 47]: CHAPTER XXVI IN WHICH A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER APPEARS UPON THE SCENE ; AND MANY THINGS , INSEPARABLE FROM THIS HISTORY , ARE DONE AND PERFORMED The old man had gained the street corner , before he began to recover the effect of Toby Crackit 's intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 53]: He had relaxed nothing of his unusual speed ; but was still pressing onward , in the same wild and disordered manner , when the sudden dashing past of a carriage : and a boisterous cry from the foot passengers , who saw his danger : drove him back upon the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 30]: Avoiding , as much as was possible , all the main streets , and skulking only through the by-ways and alleys , he at length emerged on Snow Hill .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 50]: Here he walked even faster than before ; nor did he linger until he had again turned into a court ; when , as if conscious that he was now in his proper element , he fell into his usual shuffling pace , and seemed to breathe more freely .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 38]: Near to the spot on which Snow Hill and Holborn Hill meet , opens , upon the right hand as you come out of the City , a narrow and dismal alley , leading to Saffron Hill .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 32]: In its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge bunches of second-hand silk handkerchiefs , of all sizes and patterns ; for here reside the traders who purchase them from pick-pockets .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 28]: Hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the windows or flaunting from the door-posts ; and the shelves , within , are piled with them .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 25]: Confined as the limits of Field Lane are , it has its barber , its coffee-shop , its beer-shop , and its fried-fish warehouse .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 43]: It is a commercial colony of itself : the emporium of petty larceny : visited at early morning , and setting-in of dusk , by silent merchants , who traffic in dark back-parlours , and who go as strangely as they come .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 50]: Here , the clothesman , the shoe-vamper , and the rag-merchant , display their goods , as sign-boards to the petty thief ; here , stores of old iron and bones , and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollen-stuff and linen , rust and rot in the grimy cellars .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 10]: It was into this place that the Jew turned .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 35]: He was well known to the sallow denizens of the lane ; for such of them as were on the look-out to buy or sell , nodded , familiarly , as he passed along .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 66]: He replied to their salutations in the same way ; but bestowed no closer recognition until he reached the further end of the alley ; when he stopped , to address a salesman of small stature , who had squeezed as much of his person into a child 's chair as the chair would hold , and was smoking a pipe at his warehouse door .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 17]: ` Why , the sight of you , Mr. Fagin , would cure the hoptalymy ! '
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 16]: said this respectable trader , in acknowledgment of the Jew 's inquiry after his health .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 27]: ` The neighbourhood was a little too hot , Lively , ' said Fagin , elevating his eyebrows , and crossing his hands upon his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 37]: ` Well , I 've heerd that complaint of it , once or twice before , ' replied the trader ; ` but it soon cools down again ; do n't you find it so ? '
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 6]: Fagin nodded in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 18]: Pointing in the direction of Saffron Hill , he inquired whether any one was up yonder to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 6]: ` At the Cripples ? '
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 4]: inquired the man .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 4]: The Jew nodded .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 12]: ` Let me see , ' pursued the merchant , reflecting .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 16]: ` Yes , there 's some half-dozen of 'em gone in , that I knows .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 10]: I do n't think your friend 's there . '
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 9]: ` Sikes is not , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 9]: inquired the Jew , with a disappointed countenance .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 24]: ` Non istwentus , as the lawyers say , ' replied the little man , shaking his head , and looking amazingly sly .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 11]: ` Have you got anything in my line to-night ? '
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 12]: ` Nothing to-night , ' said the Jew , turning away .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 12]: ` Are you going up to the Cripples , Fagin ? '
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 9]: cried the little man , calling after him .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 3]: ` Stop !
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 14]: I do n't mind if I have a drop there with you ! '
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 58]: But as the Jew , looking back , waved his hand to intimate that he preferred being alone ; and , moreover , as the little man could not very easily disengage himself from the chair ; the sign of the Cripples was , for a time , bereft of the advantage of Mr. Lively 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 75]: By the time he had got upon his legs , the Jew had disappeared ; so Mr. Lively , after ineffectually standing on tiptoe , in the hope of catching sight of him , again forced himself into the little chair , and , exchanging a shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop , in which doubt and mistrust were plainly mingled , resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 38]: The Three Cripples , or rather the Cripples ; which was the sign by which the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons : was the public-house in which Mr. Sikes and his dog have already figured .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 52]: Merely making a sign to a man at the bar , Fagin walked straight upstairs , and opening the door of a room , and softly insinuating himself into the chamber , looked anxiously about : shading his eyes with his hand , as if in search of some particular person .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 31]: The room was illuminated by two gas-lights ; the glare of which was prevented by the barred shutters , and closely-drawn curtains of faded red , from being visible outside .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 42]: The ceiling was blackened , to prevent its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps ; and the place was so full of dense tobacco smoke , that at first it was scarcely possible to discern anything more .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 120]: By degrees , however , as some of it cleared away through the open door , an assemblage of heads , as confused as the noises that greeted the ear , might be made out ; and as the eye grew more accustomed to the scene , the spectator gradually became aware of the presence of a numerous company , male and female , crowded round a long table : at the upper end of which , sat a chairman with a hammer of office in his hand ; while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose , and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache , presided at a jingling piano in a remote corner .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 66]: As Fagin stepped softly in , the professional gentleman , running over the keys by way of prelude , occasioned a general cry of order for a song ; which having subsided , a young lady proceeded to entertain the company with a ballad in four verses , between each of which the accompanyist played the melody all through , as loud as he could .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 36]: When this was over , the chairman gave a sentiment , after which , the professional gentleman on the chairman 's right and left volunteered a duet , and sang it , with great applause .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 16]: It was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from among the group .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 72]: There was the chairman himself , -LRB- the landlord of the house , -RRB- a coarse , rough , heavy built fellow , who , while the songs were proceeding , rolled his eyes hither and thither , and , seeming to give himself up to joviality , had an eye for everything that was done , and an ear for everything that was said -- and sharp ones , too .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 65]: Near him were the singers : receiving , with professional indifference , the compliments of the company , and applying themselves , in turn , to a dozen proffered glasses of spirits and water , tendered by their more boisterous admirers ; whose countenances , expressive of almost every vice in almost every grade , irresistibly attracted the attention , by their very repulsiveness .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 90]: Cunning , ferocity , and drunkeness in all its stages , were there , in their strongest aspect ; and women : some with the last lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you looked : others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten out , and presenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime ; some mere girls , others but young women , and none past the prime of life ; formed the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 33]: Fagin , troubled by no grave emotions , looked eagerly from face to face while these proceedings were in progress ; but apparently without meeting that of which he was in search .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 36]: Succeeding , at length , in catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair , he beckoned to him slightly , and left the room , as quietly as he had entered it .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 12]: ` What can I do for you , Mr. Fagin ? '
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 13]: inquired the man , as he followed him out to the landing .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 7]: ` Wo n't you join us ?
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 11]: They 'll be delighted , every one of 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 19]: The Jew shook his head impatiently , and said in a whisper , ` Is HE here ? '
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 8]: ` No , ' replied the man .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 8]: ` And no news of Barney ? '
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 3]: inquired Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 16]: ` None , ' replied the landlord of the Cripples ; for it was he .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 11]: ` He wo n't stir till it 's all safe .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 27]: Depend on it , they 're on the scent down there ; and that if he moved , he 'd blow upon the thing at once .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 17]: He 's all right enough , Barney is , else I should have heard of him .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 11]: I 'll pound it , that Barney 's managing properly .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 7]: Let him alone for that . '
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 8]: ` Will HE be here to-night ? '
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 14]: asked the Jew , laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as before .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 8]: ` Monks , do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 6]: inquired the landlord , hesitating .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 4]: said the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 24]: ` Certain , ' replied the man , drawing a gold watch from his fob ; ' I expected him here before now .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 47]: If you 'll wait ten minutes , he 'll be -- ' ` No , no , ' said the Jew , hastily ; as though , however desirous he might be to see the person in question , he was nevertheless relieved by his absence .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 19]: ` Tell him I came here to see him ; and that he must come to me to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 5]: No , say to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 13]: As he is not here , to-morrow will be time enough . '
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 4]: ` Good ! '
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 4]: said the man .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 5]: ` Nothing more ? '
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 16]: ` Not a word now , ' said the Jew , descending the stairs . '
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 31]: I say , ' said the other , looking over the rails , and speaking in a hoarse whisper ; ` what a time this would be for a sell !
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 18]: I 've got Phil Barker here : so drunk , that a boy might take him ! '
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 17]: But it 's not Phil Barker 's time , ' said the Jew , looking up .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 39]: ` Phil has something more to do , before we can afford to part with him ; so go back to the company , my dear , and tell them to lead merry lives -- WHILE THEY LAST .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 3]: ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 15]: The landlord reciprocated the old man 's laugh ; and returned to his guests .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 19]: The Jew was no sooner alone , than his countenance resumed its former expression of anxiety and thought .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 19]: After a brief reflection , he called a hack-cabriolet , and bade the man drive towards Bethnal Green .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 27]: He dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of Mr. Sikes 's residence , and performed the short remainder of the distance , on foot .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 41]: ` Now , ' muttered the Jew , as he knocked at the door , ` if there is any deep play here , I shall have it out of you , my girl , cunning as you are . '
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 10]: She was in her room , the woman said .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 13]: Fagin crept softly upstairs , and entered it without any previous ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 20]: The girl was alone ; lying with her head upon the table , and her hair straggling over it .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 22]: ` She has been drinking , ' thought the Jew , cooly , ` or perhaps she is only miserable . '
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 24]: The old man turned to close the door , as he made this reflection ; the noise thus occasioned , roused the girl .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 19]: She eyed his crafty face narrowly , as she inquired to his recital of Toby Crackit 's story .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 18]: When it was concluded , she sank into her former attitude , but spoke not a word .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 30]: She pushed the candle impatiently away ; and once or twice as she feverishly changed her position , shuffled her feet upon the ground ; but this was all .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 28]: During the silence , the Jew looked restlessly about the room , as if to assure himself that there were no appearances of Sikes having covertly returned .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 38]: Apparently satisfied with his inspection , he coughed twice or thrice , and made as many efforts to open a conversation ; but the girl heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 35]: At length he made another attempt ; and rubbing his hands together , said , in his most concilitory tone , ` And where should you think Bill was now , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 30]: The girl moaned out some half intelligible reply , that she could not tell ; and seemed , from the smothered noise that escaped her , to be crying .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 23]: ` And the boy , too , ' said the Jew , straining his eyes to catch a glimpse of her face .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 5]: ` Poor leetle child !
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 11]: Left in a ditch , Nance ; only think ! '
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 52]: ` The child , ' said the girl , suddenly looking up , ` is better where he is , than among us ; and if no harm comes to Bill from it , I hope he lies dead in the ditch and that his young bones may rot there . '
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 4]: ` What ! '
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 7]: cried the Jew , in amazement .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 16]: ` Ay , I do , ' returned the girl , meeting his gaze . '
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 21]: I shall be glad to have him away from my eyes , and to know that the worst is over .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 10]: I ca n't bear to have him about me .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 15]: The sight of him turns me against myself , and all of you . '
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 4]: ` Pooh ! '
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 6]: said the Jew , scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 6]: ` You 're drunk . '
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 5]: ` Am I ? '
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 5]: cried the girl bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 13]: ` It 's no fault of yours , if I am not !
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 30]: You 'd never have me anything else , if you had your will , except now ; -- the humour does n't suit you , does n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 6]: rejoined the Jew , furiously .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 6]: ` It does not . '
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 7]: ` Change it , then ! '
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 8]: responded the girl , with a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 5]: ` Change it ! '
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 28]: exclaimed the Jew , exasperated beyond all bounds by his companion 's unexpected obstinacy , and the vexation of the night , ' I WILL change it !
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 7]: Listen to me , you drab .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 27]: Listen to me , who with six words , can strangle Sikes as surely as if I had his bull 's throat between my fingers now .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 42]: If he comes back , and leaves the boy behind him ; if he gets off free , and dead or alive , fails to restore him to me ; murder him yourself if you would have him escape Jack Ketch .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 23]: And do it the moment he sets foot in this room , or mind me , it will be too late ! '
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 7]: ` What is all this ? '
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 5]: cried the girl involuntarily .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 6]: ` What is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 7]: pursued Fagin , mad with rage .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 43]: ` When the boy 's worth hundreds of pounds to me , am I to lose what chance threw me in the way of getting safely , through the whims of a drunken gang that I could whistle away the lives of !
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 54]: And me bound , too , to a born devil that only wants the will , and has the power to , to -- ' Panting for breath , the old man stammered for a word ; and in that instant checked the torrent of his wrath , and changed his whole demeanour .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 51]: A moment before , his clenched hands had grasped the air ; his eyes had dilated ; and his face grown livid with passion ; but now , he shrunk into a chair , and , cowering together , trembled with the apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 14]: After a short silence , he ventured to look round at his companion .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 21]: He appeared somewhat reassured , on beholding her in the same listless attitude from which he had first roused her .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 6]: ` Nancy , dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 9]: croaked the Jew , in his usual voice .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 9]: ` Did you mind me , dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 10]: ` Do n't worry me now , Fagin ! '
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 9]: replied the girl , raising her head languidly .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 14]: ` If Bill has not done it this time , he will another .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 35]: He has done many a good job for you , and will do many more when he can ; and when he ca n't he wo n't ; so no more about that . '
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 9]: ` Regarding this boy , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 13]: said the Jew , rubbing the palms of his hands nervously together .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 52]: ` The boy must take his chance with the rest , ' interrupted Nancy , hastily ; ` and I say again , I hope he is dead , and out of harm 's way , and out of yours , -- that is , if Bill comes to no harm .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 26]: And if Toby got clear off , Bill 's pretty sure to be safe ; for Bill 's worth two of Toby any time . '
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 12]: ` And about what I was saying , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 12]: observed the Jew , keeping his glistening eye steadily upon her .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 36]: ` Your must say it all over again , if it 's anything you want me to do , ' rejoined Nancy ; ` and if it is , you had better wait till to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 16]: You put me up for a minute ; but now I 'm stupid again . '
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 59]: Fagin put several other questions : all with the same drift of ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints ; but , she answered them so readily , and was withal so utterly unmoved by his searching looks , that his original impression of her being more than a trifle in liquor , was confirmed .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 37]: Nancy , indeed , was not exempt from a failing which was very common among the Jew 's female pupils ; and in which , in their tenderer years , they were rather encouraged than checked .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 84]: Her disordered appearance , and a wholesale perfume of Geneva which pervaded the apartment , afforded stong confirmatory evidence of the justice of the Jew 's supposition ; and when , after indulging in the temporary display of violence above described , she subsided , first into dullness , and afterwards into a compound of feelings : under the influence of which she shed tears one minute , and in the next gave utterance to various exclamations of ` Never say die ! '
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 52]: and divers calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a lady or gentleman was happy , Mr. Fagin , who had had considerable experience of such matters in his time , saw , with great satisfaction , that she was very far gone indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 64]: Having eased his mind by this discovery ; and having accomplished his twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had , that night , heard , and of ascertaining , with his own eyes , that Sikes had not returned , Mr. Fagin again turned his face homeward : leaving his young friend asleep , with her head upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 8]: It was within an hour of midnight .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 17]: The weather being dark , and piercing cold , he had no great temptation to loiter .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 38]: The sharp wind that scoured the streets , seemed to have cleared them of passengers , as of dust and mud , for few people were abroad , and they were to all appearance hastening fast home .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 35]: It blew from the right quarter for the Jew , however , and straight before it he went : trembling , and shivering , as every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 48]: He had reached the corner of his own street , and was already fumbling in his pocket for the door-key , when a dark figure emerged from a projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow , and , crossing the road , glided up to him unperceived .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 4]: ` Fagin ! '
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 8]: whispered a voice close to his ear .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 17]: said the Jew , turning quickly round , ` is that -- ' ` Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 5]: interrupted the stranger . '
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 9]: I have been lingering here these two hours .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 8]: Where the devil have you been ? '
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 27]: ` On your business , my dear , ' replied the Jew , glancing uneasily at his companion , and slackening his pace as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 8]: ` On your business all night . '
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 7]: ` Oh , of course ! '
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 8]: said the stranger , with a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 11]: ` Well ; and what 's come of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 9]: ` Nothing good , ' said the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 8]: ` Nothing bad , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 16]: said the stranger , stopping short , and turning a startled look on his companion .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 68]: The Jew shook his head , and was about to reply , when the stranger , interrupting him , motioned to the house , before which they had by this time arrived : remarking , that he had better say what he had got to say , under cover : for his blood was chilled with standing about so long , and the wind blew through him .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 61]: Fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking home a visitor at that unseasonable hour ; and , indeed , muttered something about having no fire ; but his companion repeating his request in a peremptory manner , he unlocked the door , and requested him to close it softly , while he got a light .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 20]: ` It 's as dark as the grave , ' said the man , groping forward a few steps .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 5]: ` Make haste ! '
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 15]: ` Shut the door , ' whispered Fagin from the end of the passage .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 11]: As he spoke , it closed with a loud noise .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 17]: ` That was n't my doing , ' said the other man , feeling his way .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 20]: ` The wind blew it to , or it shut of its own accord : one or the other .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 21]: Look sharp with the light , or I shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole . '
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 7]: Fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 36]: After a short absence , he returned with a lighted candle , and the intelligence that Toby Crackit was asleep in the back room below , and that the boys were in the front one .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 13]: Beckoning the man to follow him , he led the way upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 60]: ` We can say the few words we 've got to say in here , my dear , ' said the Jew , throwing open a door on the first floor ; ` and as there are holes in the shutters , and we never show lights to our neighbours , we 'll set the candle on the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 3]: There ! '
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 27]: With those words , the Jew , stooping down , placed the candle on an upper flight of stairs , exactly opposite to the room door .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 37]: This done , he led the way into the apartment ; which was destitute of all movables save a broken arm-chair , and an old couch or sofa without covering , which stood behind the door .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 34]: Upon this piece of furniture , the stranger sat himself with the air of a weary man ; and the Jew , drawing up the arm-chair opposite , they sat face to face .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 26]: It was not quite dark ; the door was partially open ; and the candle outside , threw a feeble reflection on the opposite wall .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 8]: They conversed for some time in whispers .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 48]: Though nothing of the conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and there , a listener might easily have perceived that Fagin appeared to be defending himself against some remarks of the stranger ; and that the latter was in a state of considerable irritation .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 58]: They might have been talking , thus , for a quarter of an hour or more , when Monks -- by which name the Jew had designated the strange man several times in the course of their colloquy -- said , raising his voice a little , ' I tell you again , it was badly planned .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 23]: Why not have kept him here among the rest , and made a sneaking , snivelling pickpocket of him at once ? '
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 6]: ` Only hear him ! '
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 8]: exclaimed the Jew , shrugging his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 21]: ` Why , do you mean to say you could n't have done it , if you had chosen ? '
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 5]: demanded Monks , sternly .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 15]: ` Have n't you done it , with other boys , scores of times ?
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 33]: If you had had patience for a twelvemonth , at most , could n't you have got him convicted , and sent safely out of the kingdom ; perhaps for life ? '
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 12]: ` Whose turn would that have served , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 5]: inquired the Jew humbly .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 7]: ` Mine , ' replied Monks .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 12]: ` But not mine , ' said the Jew , submissively .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 10]: ` He might have become of use to me .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 30]: When there are two parties to a bargain , it is only reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted ; is it , my good friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 5]: ` What then ? '
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 4]: demanded Monks . '
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 31]: I saw it was not easy to train him to the business , ' replied the Jew ; ` he was not like other boys in the same circumstances . '
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 7]: ` Curse him , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 18]: muttered the man , ` or he would have been a thief , long ago . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 24]: I had no hold upon him to make him worse , ' pursued the Jew , anxiously watching the countenance of his companion .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 7]: ` His hand was not in .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 23]: I had nothing to frighten him with ; which we always must have in the beginning , or we labour in vain .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 5]: What could I do ?
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 9]: Send him out with the Dodger and Charley ?
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 19]: We had enough of that , at first , my dear ; I trembled for us all . '
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 11]: ` THAT was not my doing , ' observed Monks .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 9]: ` No , no , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 4]: renewed the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 46]: ` And I do n't quarrel with it now ; because , if it had never happened , you might never have clapped eyes on the boy to notice him , and so led to the discovery that it was him you were looking for .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 21]: I got him back for you by means of the girl ; and then SHE begins to favour him . '
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 6]: ` Throttle the girl ! '
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 5]: said Monks , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 54]: ` Why , we ca n't afford to do that just now , my dear , ' replied the Jew , smiling ; ` and , besides , that sort of thing is not in our way ; or , one of these days , I might be glad to have it done .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 11]: I know what these girls are , Monks , well .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 24]: As soon as the boy begins to harden , she 'll care no more for him , than for a block of wood .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 7]: You want him made a thief .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 68]: If he is alive , I can make him one from this time ; and , if -- if -- ' said the Jew , drawing nearer to the other , -- ` it 's not likely , mind , -- but if the worst comes to the worst , and he is dead -- ' ` It 's no fault of mine if he is ! '
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 21]: interposed the other man , with a look of terror , and clasping the Jew 's arm with trembling hands .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 4]: ` Mind that .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 2]: Fagin !
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 7]: I had no hand in it .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 12]: Anything but his death , I told you from the first .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 18]: I wo n't shed blood ; it 's always found out , and haunts a man besides .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 17]: If they shot him dead , I was not the cause ; do you hear me ?
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 5]: Fire this infernal den !
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 5]: What 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 4]: ` What ! '
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 22]: cried the Jew , grasping the coward round the body , with both arms , as he sprung to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 4]: ` Where ? '
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 3]: ` Yonder !
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 10]: replied the man , glaring at the opposite wall .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 4]: ` The shadow !
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 23]: I saw the shadow of a woman , in a cloak and bonnet , pass along the wainscot like a breath ! '
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 14]: The Jew released his hold , and they rushed tumultuously from the room .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 16]: The candle , wasted by the draught , was standing where it had been placed .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 14]: It showed them only the empty staircase , and their own white faces .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 12]: They listened intently : a profound silence reigned throughout the house .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 21]: ` It 's your fancy , ' said the Jew , taking up the light and turning to his companion .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 9]: ` I 'll swear I saw it ! '
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 5]: replied Monks , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 21]: ` It was bending forward when I saw it first ; and when I spoke , it darted away . '
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 28]: The Jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate , and , telling him he could follow , if he pleased , ascended the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 16]: They looked into all the rooms ; they were cold , bare , and empty .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 13]: They descended into the passage , and thence into the cellars below .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 31]: The green damp hung upon the low walls ; the tracks of the snail and slug glistened in the light of the candle ; but all was still as death .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 8]: ` What do you think now ? '
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 11]: said the Jew , when they had regained the passage .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 24]: ` Besides ourselves , there 's not a creature in the house except Toby and the boys ; and they 're safe enough .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 4]: See here ! '
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 41]: As a proof of the fact , the Jew drew forth two keys from his pocket ; and explained , that when he first went downstairs , he had locked them in , to prevent any intrusion on the conference .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 8]: This accumulated testimony effectually staggered Mr. Monks .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 44]: His protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they proceeded in their search without making any discovery ; and , now , he gave vent to several very grim laughs , and confessed it could only have been his excited imagination .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 23]: He declined any renewal of the conversation , however , for that night : suddenly remembering that it was past one o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 7]: And so the amiable couple parted .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 215]: CHAPTER XXVII ATONES FOR THE UNPOLITENESS OF A FORMER CHAPTER ; WHICH DESERTED A LADY , MOST UNCEREMONIOUSLY As it would be , by no means , seemly in a humble author to keep so mighty a personage as a beadle waiting , with his back to the fire , and the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms , until such time as it might suit his pleasure to relieve him ; and as it would still less become his station , or his gallentry to involve in the same neglect a lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and affection , and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words , which , coming from such a quarter , might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of whatsoever degree ; the historian whose pen traces these words -- trusting that he knows his place , and that he entertains a becoming reverence for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is delegated -- hastens to pay them that respect which their position demands , and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their exalted rank , and -LRB- by consequence -RRB- great virtues , imperatively claim at his hands .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 187]: Towards this end , indeed , he had purposed to introduce , in this place , a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles , and elucidative of the position , that a beadle can do no wrong : which could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the right-minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled , by want of time and space , to postpone to some more convenient and fitting opportunity ; on the arrival of which , he will be prepared to show , that a beadle properly constituted : that is to say , a parochial beadle , attached to a parochail workhouse , and attending in his official capacity the parochial church : is , in right and virtue of his office , possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity ; and that to none of those excellences , can mere companies ' beadles , or court-of-law beadles , or even chapel-of-ease beadles -LRB- save the last , and they in a very lowly and inferior degree -RRB- , lay the remotest sustainable claim .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 67]: Mr. Bumble had re-counted the teaspoons , re-weighed the sugar-tongs , made a closer inspection of the milk-pot , and ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture , down to the very horse-hair seats of the chairs ; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times ; before he began to think that it was time for Mrs. Corney to return .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 57]: Thinking begets thinking ; as there were no sounds of Mrs. Corney 's approach , it occured to Mr. Bumble that it would be an innocent and virtuous way of spending the time , if he were further to allay his curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of Mrs. Corney 's chest of drawers .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 72]: Having listened at the keyhole , to assure himself that nobody was approaching the chamber , Mr. Bumble , beginning at the bottom , proceeded to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers : which , being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture , carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers , speckled with dried lavender : seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 80]: Arriving , in course of time , at the right-hand corner drawer -LRB- in which was the key -RRB- , and beholding therein a small padlocked box , which , being shaken , gave forth a pleasant sound , as of the chinking of coin , Mr. Bumble returned with a stately walk to the fireplace ; and , resuming his old attitude , said , with a grave and determined air , ` I 'll do it ! '
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 53]: He followed up this remarkable declaration , by shaking his head in a waggish manner for ten minutes , as though he were remonstrating with himself for being such a pleasant dog ; and then , he took a view of his legs in profile , with much seeming pleasure and interest .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 54]: He was still placidly engaged in this latter survey , when Mrs. Corney , hurrying into the room , threw herself , in a breathless state , on a chair by the fireside , and covering her eyes with one hand , placed the other over her heart , and gasped for breath .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 21]: ` Mrs. Corney , ' said Mr. Bumble , stooping over the matron , ` what is this , ma'am ?
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 6]: Has anything happened , ma'am ?
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 37]: Pray answer me : I 'm on -- on -- ' Mr. Bumble , in his alarm , could not immediately think of the word ` tenterhooks , ' so he said ` broken bottles . '
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 7]: ` Oh , Mr. Bumble ! '
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 14]: cried the lady , ' I have been so dreadfully put out ! '
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 7]: ` Put out , ma'am ! '
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 11]: exclaimed Mr. Bumble ; ` who has dared to -- ?
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 4]: I know ! '
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 19]: said Mr. Bumble , checking himself , with native majesty , ` this is them wicious paupers ! '
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 9]: ` It 's dreadful to think of ! '
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 6]: said the lady , shuddering .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 16]: ` Then DO N'T think of it , ma'am , ' rejoined Mr. Bumble . '
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 11]: I ca n't help it , ' whimpered the lady .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 14]: ` Then take something , ma'am , ' said Mr. Bumble soothingly . '
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 7]: A little of the wine ? '
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 7]: ` Not for the world ! '
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 5]: replied Mrs. Corney . '
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 7]: I could n't , -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 11]: The top shelf in the right-hand corner -- oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 23]: Uttering these words , the good lady pointed , distractedly , to the cupboard , and underwent a convulsion from internal spasms .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 37]: Mr. Bumble rushed to the closet ; and , snatching a pint green-glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated , filled a tea-cup with its contents , and held it to the lady 's lips .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 20]: ` I 'm better now , ' said Mrs. Corney , falling back , after drinking half of it .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 31]: Mr. Bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness ; and , bringing them down again to the brim of the cup , lifted it to his nose .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 22]: ` Peppermint , ' exclaimed Mrs. Corney , in a faint voice , smiling gently on the beadle as she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 4]: ` Try it !
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 13]: There 's a little -- a little something else in it . '
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 25]: Mr. Bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look ; smacked his lips ; took another taste ; and put the cup down empty .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 11]: ` It 's very comforting , ' said Mrs. Corney .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 13]: ` Very much so indeed , ma'am , ' said the beadle .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 22]: As he spoke , he drew a chair beside the matron , and tenderly inquired what had happened to distress her .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 9]: ` Nothing , ' replied Mrs. Corney . '
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 11]: I am a foolish , excitable , weak creetur . '
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 18]: ` Not weak , ma'am , ' retorted Mr. Bumble , drawing his chair a little closer .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 11]: ` Are you a weak creetur , Mrs. Corney ? '
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 18]: ` We are all weak creeturs , ' said Mrs. Corney , laying down a general principle .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 10]: ` So we are , ' said the beadle .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 14]: Nothing was said on either side , for a minute or two afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 46]: By the expiration of that time , Mr. Bumble had illustrated the position by removing his left arm from the back of Mrs. Corney 's chair , where it had previously rested , to Mrs. Corney 's aprong-string , round which is gradually became entwined .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 12]: ` We are all weak creeturs , ' said Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 4]: Mrs. Corney sighed .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 14]: ` Do n't sigh , Mrs. Corney , ' said Mr. Bumble . '
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 11]: I ca n't help it , ' said Mrs. Corney .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 5]: And she sighed again .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 17]: ` This is a very comfortable room , ma'am , ' said Mr. Bumble looking round .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 16]: ` Another room , and this , ma'am , would be a complete thing . '
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 14]: ` It would be too much for one , ' murmured the lady .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 17]: ` But not for two , ma'am , ' rejoined Mr. Bumble , in soft accents .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 7]: ` Eh , Mrs. Corney ? '
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 27]: Mrs. Corney drooped her head , when the beadle said this ; the beadle drooped his , to get a view of Mrs. Corney 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 32]: Mrs. Corney , with great propriety , turned her head away , and released her hand to get at her pocket-handkerchief ; but insensibly replaced it in that of Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 15]: ` The board allows you coals , do n't they , Mrs. Corney ? '
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 9]: inquired the beadle , affectionately pressing her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 14]: ` And candles , ' replied Mrs. Corney , slightly returning the pressure .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 14]: ` Coals , candles , and house-rent free , ' said Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 13]: ` Oh , Mrs. Corney , what an Angel you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 11]: The lady was not proof against this burst of feeling .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 24]: She sank into Mr. Bumble 's arms ; and that gentleman in his agitation , imprinted a passionate kiss upon her chaste nose .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 6]: ` Such porochial perfection ! '
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 6]: exclaimed Mr. Bumble , rapturously .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 14]: ` You know that Mr. Slout is worse to-night , my fascinator ? '
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 10]: ` Yes , ' replied Mrs. Corney , bashfully .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 17]: ` He ca n't live a week , the doctor says , ' pursued Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 23]: ` He is the master of this establishment ; his death will cause a wacancy ; that wacancy must be filled up .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 11]: Oh , Mrs. Corney , what a prospect this opens !
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 12]: What a opportunity for a jining of hearts and housekeepings ! '
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 4]: Mrs. Corney sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 6]: ` The little word ? '
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 10]: said Mr. Bumble , bending over the bashful beauty .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 15]: ` The one little , little , little word , my blessed Corney ? '
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 8]: ` Ye -- ye -- yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 5]: sighed out the matron .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 19]: ` One more , ' pursued the beadle ; ` compose your darling feelings for only one more .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 8]: When is it to come off ? '
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 11]: Mrs. Corney twice essayed to speak : and twice failed .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 39]: At length summoning up courage , she threw her arms around Mr. Bumble 's neck , and said , it might be as soon as ever he pleased , and that he was ' a irresistible duck . '
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 39]: Matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged , the contract was solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture ; which was rendered the more necessary , by the flutter and agitation of the lady 's spirits .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 18]: While it was being disposed of , she acquainted Mr. Bumble with the old woman 's decease .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 33]: ` Very good , ' said that gentleman , sipping his peppermint ; ` I 'll call at Sowerberry 's as I go home , and tell him to send to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 10]: Was it that as frightened you , love ? '
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 15]: ` It was n't anything particular , dear , ' said the lady evasively .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 14]: ` It must have been something , love , ' urged Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 10]: ` Wo n't you tell your own B. ? '
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 15]: ` Not now , ' rejoined the lady ; ` one of these days .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 8]: After we 're married , dear . '
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 7]: ` After we 're married ! '
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 4]: exclaimed Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 23]: ` It was n't any impudence from any of them male paupers as -- ' ` No , no , love ! '
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 6]: interposed the lady , hastily .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 51]: ` If I thought it was , ' continued Mr. Bumble ; ` if I thought as any one of 'em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance -- ' ` They would n't have dared to do it , love , ' responded the lady .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 7]: ` They had better not ! '
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 8]: said Mr. Bumble , clenching his fist .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 34]: ` Let me see any man , porochial or extra-porochial , as would presume to do it ; and I can tell him that he would n't do it a second time ! '
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 59]: Unembellished by any violence of gesticulation , this might have seemed no very high compliment to the lady 's charms ; but , as Mr. Bumble accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures , she was much touched with this proof of his devotion , and protested , with great admiration , that he was indeed a dove .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 78]: The dove then turned up his coat-collar , and put on his cocked hat ; and , having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future partner , once again braved the cold wind of the night : merely pausing , for a few minutes , in the male paupers ' ward , to abuse them a little , with the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of workhouse-master with needful acerbity .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 38]: Assured of his qualifications , Mr. Bumble left the building with a light heart , and bright visions of his future promotion : which served to occupy his mind until he reached the shop of the undertaker .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 65]: Now , Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper : and Noah Claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient performance of the two functions of eating and drinking , the shop was not closed , although it was past the usual hour of shutting-up .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 66]: Mr. Bumble tapped with his cane on the counter several times ; but , attracting no attention , and beholding a light shining through the glass-window of the little parlour at the back of the shop , he made bold to peep in and see what was going forward ; and when he saw what was going forward , he was not a little surprised .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 26]: The cloth was laid for supper ; the table was covered with bread and butter , plates and glasses ; a porter-pot and a wine-bottle .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 44]: At the upper end of the table , Mr. Noah Claypole lolled negligently in an easy-chair , with his legs thrown over one of the arms : an open clasp-knife in one hand , and a mass of buttered bread in the other .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 23]: Close beside him stood Charlotte , opening oysters from a barrel : which Mr. Claypole condescended to swallow , with remarkable avidity .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 74]: A more than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentleman 's nose , and a kind of fixed wink in his right eye , denoted that he was in a slight degree intoxicated ; these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish with which he took his oysters , for which nothing but a strong appreciation of their cooling properties , in cases of internal fever , could have sufficiently accounted .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 13]: ` Here 's a delicious fat one , Noah , dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 14]: said Charlotte ; ` try him , do ; only this one . '
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 10]: ` What a delicious thing is a oyster ! '
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 10]: remarked Mr. Claypole , after he had swallowed it .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 25]: ` What a pity it is , a number of 'em should ever make you feel uncomfortable ; is n't it , Charlotte ? '
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 11]: ` It 's quite a cruelty , ' said Charlotte .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 10]: ` So it is , ' acquiesced Mr. Claypole .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 9]: ` A n't yer fond of oysters ? '
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 9]: ` Not overmuch , ' replied Charlotte . '
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 18]: I like to see you eat 'em , Noah dear , better than eating 'em myself . '
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 4]: ` Lor ! '
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 10]: said Noah , reflectively ; ` how queer ! '
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 8]: ` Have another , ' said Charlotte .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 14]: ` Here 's one with such a beautiful , delicate beard ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 11]: I ca n't manage any more , ' said Noah .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 6]: ` I 'm very sorry .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 12]: Come here , Charlotte , and I 'll kiss yer . '
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 4]: ` What ! '
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 9]: said Mr. Bumble , bursting into the room .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 8]: ` Say that again , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 13]: Charlotte uttered a scream , and hid her face in her apron .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 28]: Mr. Claypole , without making any further change in his position than suffering his legs to reach the ground , gazed at the beadle in drunken terror .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 12]: ` Say it again , you wile , owdacious fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 4]: said Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 11]: ` How dare you mention such a thing , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 11]: And how dare you encourage him , you insolent minx ?
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 4]: Kiss her ! '
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 8]: exclaimed Mr. Bumble , in strong indignation .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 5]: ` Faugh ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 9]: I did n't mean to do it ! '
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 5]: said Noah , blubbering .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 17]: ` She 's always a-kissing of me , whether I like it , or not . '
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 11]: ` Oh , Noah , ' cried Charlotte , reproachfully .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 10]: ` Yer are ; yer know yer are ! '
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 3]: retorted Noah .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 33]: ` She 's always a-doin ' of it , Mr. Bumble , sir ; she chucks me under the chin , please , sir ; and makes all manner of love ! '
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 4]: ` Silence ! '
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 6]: cried Mr. Bumble , sternly .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 7]: ` Take yourself downstairs , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 49]: Noah , you shut up the shop ; say another word till your master comes home , at your peril ; and , when he does come home , tell him that Mr. Bumble said he was to send a old woman 's shell after breakfast to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 5]: Do you hear sir ?
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 3]: Kissing ! '
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 9]: cried Mr. Bumble , holding up his hands .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 16]: ` The sin and wickedness of the lower orders in this porochial district is frightful !
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 27]: If Parliament do n't take their abominable courses under consideration , this country 's ruined , and the character of the peasantry gone for ever ! '
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 21]: With these words , the beadle strode , with a lofty and gloomy air , from the undertaker 's premises .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 56]: And now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home , and have made all necessary preparations for the old woman 's funeral , let us set on foot a few inquires after young Oliver Twist , and ascertain whether he be still lying in the ditch where Toby Crackit left him .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 18]: CHAPTER XXVIII LOOKS AFTER OLIVER , AND PROCEEDS WITH HIS ADVENTURES ` Wolves tear your throats ! '
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 8]: muttered Sikes , grinding his teeth . '
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 18]: I wish I was among some of you ; you 'd howl the hoarser for it . '
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 49]: As Sikes growled forth this imprecation , with the most desperate ferocity that his desperate nature was capable of , he rested the body of the wounded boy across his bended knee ; and turned his head , for an instant , to look back at his pursuers .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 47]: There was little to be made out , in the mist and darkness ; but the loud shouting of men vibrated through the air , and the barking of the neighbouring dogs , roused by the sound of the alarm bell , resounded in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 8]: ` Stop , you white-livered hound ! '
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 24]: cried the robber , shouting after Toby Crackit , who , making the best use of his long legs , was already ahead .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 4]: ` Stop ! '
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 13]: The repetition of the word , brought Toby to a dead stand-still .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 26]: For he was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistol-shot ; and Sikes was in no mood to be played with .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 18]: ` Bear a hand with the boy , ' cried Sikes , beckoning furiously to his confederate .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 5]: ` Come back ! '
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 31]: Toby made a show of returning ; but ventured , in a low voice , broken for want of breath , to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly along .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 4]: ` Quicker ! '
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 22]: cried Sikes , laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet , and drawing a pistol from his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 9]: ` Do n't play booty with me . '
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 8]: At this moment the noise grew louder .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 42]: Sikes , again looking round , could discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate of the field in which he stood ; and that a couple of dogs were some paces in advance of them .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 9]: ` It 's all up , Bill ! '
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 15]: cried Toby ; ` drop the kid , and show 'em your heels . '
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 39]: With this parting advice , Mr. Crackit , preferring the chance of being shot by his friend , to the certainty of being taken by his enemies , fairly turned tail , and darted off at full speed .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 89]: Sikes clenched his teeth ; took one look around ; threw over the prostrate form of Oliver , the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled ; ran along the front of the hedge , as if to distract the attention of those behind , from the spot where the boy lay ; paused , for a second , before another hedge which met it at right angles ; and whirling his pistol high into the air , cleared it at a bound , and was gone .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 8]: ` Ho , ho , there ! '
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 8]: cried a tremulous voice in the rear .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 3]: ` Pincher !
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 2]: Neptune !
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 7]: Come here , come here ! '
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 32]: The dogs , who , in common with their masters , seemed to have no particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged , readily answered to the command .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 21]: Three men , who had by this time advanced some distance into the field , stopped to take counsel together .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 37]: ` My advice , or , leastways , I should say , my ORDERS , is , ' said the fattest man of the party , ` that we ` mediately go home again . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 48]: I am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to Mr. Giles , ' said a shorter man ; who was by no means of a slim figure , and who was very pale in the face , and very polite : as frightened men frequently are . '
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 30]: I should n't wish to appear ill-mannered , gentlemen , ' said the third , who had called the dogs back , ` Mr. Giles ought to know . '
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 25]: ` Certainly , ' replied the shorter man ; ` and whatever Mr. Giles says , it is n't our place to contradict him .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 9]: No , no , I know my sitiwation !
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 10]: Thank my stars , I know my sitiwation . '
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 41]: To tell the truth , the little man DID seem to know his situation , and to know perfectly well that it was by no means a desirable one ; for his teeth chattered in his head as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 13]: ` You are afraid , Brittles , ' said Mr. Giles . '
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 8]: I a n't , ' said Brittles .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 8]: ` You are , ' said Giles .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 13]: ` You 're a falsehood , Mr. Giles , ' said Brittles .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 13]: ` You 're a lie , Brittles , ' said Mr. Giles .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 40]: Now , these four retorts arose from Mr. Giles 's taunt ; and Mr. Giles 's taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the responsibility of going home again , imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 13]: The third man brought the dispute to a close , most philosophically .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 22]: ` I 'll tell you what it is , gentlemen , ' said he , ` we 're all afraid . '
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 20]: ` Speak for yourself , sir , ' said Mr. Giles , who was the palest of the party .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 10]: ` So I do , ' replied the man .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 14]: ` It 's natural and proper to be afraid , under such circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 4]: I am . '
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 26]: ` So am I , ' said Brittles ; ` only there 's no call to tell a man he is , so bounceably . '
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 70]: These frank admissions softened Mr. Giles , who at once owned that HE was afraid ; upon which , they all three faced about , and ran back again with the completest unanimity , until Mr. Giles -LRB- who had the shortest wind of the party , as was encumbered with a pitchfork -RRB- most handsomely insisted on stopping , to make an apology for his hastiness of speech .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 29]: ` But it 's wonderful , ' said Mr. Giles , when he had explained , ` what a man will do , when his blood is up .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 21]: I should have committed murder -- I know I should -- if we 'd caught one of them rascals . '
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 40]: As the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment ; and as their blood , like his , had all gone down again ; some speculation ensued upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament . '
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 19]: I know what it was , ' said Mr. Giles ; ` it was the gate . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 17]: I should n't wonder if it was , ' exclaimed Brittles , catching at the idea .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 22]: ` You may depend upon it , ' said Giles , ` that that gate stopped the flow of the excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 16]: I felt all mine suddenly going away , as I was climbing over it . '
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 21]: By a remarkable coincidence , the other two had been visited with the same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 50]: It was quite obvious , therefore , that it was the gate ; especially as there was no doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place , because all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the instant of its occurance .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 45]: This dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the burglars , and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse , and who had been roused , together with his two mongrel curs , to join in the pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 52]: Mr. Giles acted in the double capacity of butler and steward to the old lady of the mansion ; Brittles was a lad of all-work : who , having entered her service a mere child , was treated as a promising young boy still , though he was something past thirty .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 62]: Encouraging each other with such converse as this ; but , keeping very close together , notwithstanding , and looking apprehensively round , whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs ; the three men hurried back to a tree , behind which they had left their lantern , lest its light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 61]: Catching up the light , they made the best of their way home , at a good round trot ; and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible , the light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance , like some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly borne .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 25]: The air grew colder , as day came slowly on ; and the mist rolled along the ground like a dense cloud of smoke .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 34]: The grass was wet ; the pathways , and low places , were all mire and water ; the damp breath of an unwholesome wind went languidly by , with a hollow moaning .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 16]: Still , Oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where Sikes had left him .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 5]: Morning drew on apace .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 32]: The air become more sharp and piercing , as its first dull hue -- the death of night , rather than the birth of day -- glimmered faintly in the sky .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 26]: The objects which had looked dim and terrible in the darkness , grew more and more defined , and gradually resolved into their familiar shapes .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 17]: The rain came down , thick and fast , and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 29]: But , Oliver felt it not , as it beat against him ; for he still lay stretched , helpless and unconscious , on his bed of clay .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 22]: At length , a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed ; and uttering it , the boy awoke .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 25]: His left arm , rudely bandaged in a shawl , hung heavy and useless at his side ; the bandage was saturated with blood .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 34]: He was so weak , that he could scarcely raise himself into a sitting posture ; when he had done so , he looked feebly round for help , and groaned with pain .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 32]: Trembling in every joint , from cold and exhaustion , he made an effort to stand upright ; but , shuddering from head to foot , fell prostrate on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 53]: After a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged , Oliver : urged by a creeping sickness at his heart , which seemed to warn him that if he lay there , he must surely die : got upon his feet , and essayed to walk .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 16]: His head was dizzy , and he staggered to and from like a drunken man .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 27]: But he kept up , nevertheless , and , with his head drooping languidly on his breast , went stumbling onward , he knew not whither .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 15]: And now , hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his mind .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 60]: He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit , who were angrily disputing -- for the very words they said , sounded in his ears ; and when he caught his own attention , as it were , by making some violent effort to save himself from falling , he found that he was talking to them .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 33]: Then , he was alone with Sikes , plodding on as on the previous day ; and as shadowy people passed them , he felt the robber 's grasp upon his wrist .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 43]: Suddenly , he started back at the report of firearms ; there rose into the air , loud cries and shouts ; lights gleamed before his eyes ; all was noise and tumult , as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 23]: Through all these rapid visions , there ran an undefined , uneasy conscious of pain , which wearied and tormented him incessantly .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 32]: Thus he staggered on , creeping , almost mechanically , between the bars of gates , or through hedge-gaps as they came in his way , until he reached a road .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 14]: Here the rain began to fall so heavily , that it roused him .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 22]: He looked about , and saw that at no great distance there was a house , which perhaps he could reach .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 38]: Pitying his condition , they might have compassion on him ; and if they did not , it would be better , he thought , to die near human beings , than in the lonely open fields .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 19]: He summoned up all his strength for one last trial , and bent his faltering steps towards it .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 20]: As he drew nearer to this house , a feeling come over him that he had seen it before .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 20]: He remembered nothing of its details ; but the shape and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 4]: That garden wall !
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 22]: On the grass inside , he had fallen on his knees last night , and prayed the two men 's mercy .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 11]: It was the very house they had attempted to rob .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 33]: Oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place , that , for the instant , he forgot the agony of his wound , and thought only of flight .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 2]: Flight !
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 29]: He could scarcely stand : and if he were in full possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame , whither could he fly ?
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 17]: He pushed against the garden-gate ; it was unlocked , and swung open on its hinges .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 36]: He tottered across the lawn ; climbed the steps ; knocked faintly at the door ; and , his whole strength failing him , sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 38]: It happened that about this time , Mr. Giles , Brittles , and the tinker , were recruiting themselves , after the fatigues and terrors of the night , with tea and sundries , in the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 52]: Not that it was Mr. Giles 's habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants : towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty affability , which , while it gratified , could not fail to remind them of his superior position in society .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 76]: But , death , fires , and burglary , make all men equals ; so Mr. Giles sat with his legs stretched out before the kitchen fender , leaning his left arm on the table , while , with his right , he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of the robbery , to which his bearers -LRB- but especially the cook and housemaid , who were of the party -RRB- listened with breathless interest .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 80]: ` It was about half-past tow , ' said Mr. Giles , ` or I would n't swear that it might n't have been a little nearer three , when I woke up , and , turning round in my bed , as it might be so , -LRB- here Mr. Giles turned round in his chair , and pulled the corner of the table-cloth over him to imitate bed-clothes , -RRB- I fancied I heerd a noise . '
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 36]: At this point of the narrative the cook turned pale , and asked the housemaid to shut the door : who asked Brittles , who asked the tinker , who pretended not to hear . '
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 11]: -- Heerd a noise , ' continued Mr. Giles . '
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 30]: I says , at first , `` This is illusion '' ; and was composing myself off to sleep , when I heerd the noise again , distinct . '
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 8]: ` What sort of a noise ? '
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 5]: asked the cook . '
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 16]: A kind of a busting noise , ' replied Mr. Giles , looking round him .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 18]: ` More like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg-grater , ' suggested Brittles .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 29]: ` It was , when you HEERD it , sir , ' rejoined Mr. Giles ; ` but , at this time , it had a busting sound .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 25]: I turned down the clothes ' ; continued Giles , rolling back the table-cloth , ` sat up in bed ; and listened . '
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 10]: The cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated ` Lor ! '
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 8]: and drew their chairs closer together . '
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 14]: I heerd it now , quite apparent , ' resumed Mr. Giles . '
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 23]: `` Somebody , '' I says , `` is forcing of a door , or window ; what 's to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 48]: I 'll call up that poor lad , Brittles , and save him from being murdered in his bed ; or his throat , '' I says , `` may be cut from his right ear to his left , without his ever knowing it . '' '
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 38]: Here , all eyes were turned upon Brittles , who fixed his upon the speaker , and stared at him , with his mouth wide open , and his face expressive of the most unmitigated horror . '
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 52]: I tossed off the clothes , ' said Giles , throwing away the table-cloth , and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid , ` got softly out of bed ; drew on a pair of -- ' ` Ladies present , Mr. Giles , ' murmured the tinker . '
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 43]: -- Of SHOES , sir , ' said Giles , turning upon him , and laying great emphasis on the word ; ` seized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the plate-basket ; and walked on tiptoes to his room .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 21]: `` Brittles , '' I says , when I had woke him , `` do n't be frightened ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 15]: ` So you did , ' observed Brittles , in a low voice . '
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 29]: `` We 're dead men , I think , Brittles , '' I says , ' continued Giles ; ' `` but do n't be frightened . '' '
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 6]: ` WAS he frightened ? '
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 4]: asked the cook .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 12]: ` Not a bit of it , ' replied Mr. Giles .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 8]: ` He was as firm -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 10]: pretty near as firm as I was . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 22]: I should have died at once , I 'm sure , if it had been me , ' observed the housemaid .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 15]: ` You 're a woman , ' retorted Brittles , plucking up a little .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 28]: ` Brittles is right , ' said Mr. Giles , nodding his head , approvingly ; ` from a woman , nothing else was to be expected .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 35]: We , being men , took a dark lantern that was standing on Brittle 's hob , and groped our way downstairs in the pitch dark , -- as it might be so . '
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 46]: Mr. Giles had risen from his seat , and taken two steps with his eyes shut , to accompany his description with appropriate action , when he started violently , in common with the rest of the company , and hurried back to his chair .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 6]: The cook and housemaid screamed .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 15]: ` It was a knock , ' said Mr. Giles , assuming perfect serenity .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 8]: ` Open the door , somebody . '
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 3]: Nobody moved .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 48]: ` It seems a strange sort of a thing , a knock coming at such a time in the morning , ' said Mr. Giles , surveying the pale faces which surrounded him , and looking very blank himself ; ` but the door must be opened .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 7]: Do you hear , somebody ? '
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 48]: Mr. Giles , as he spoke , looked at Brittles ; but that young man , being naturally modest , probably considered himself nobody , and so held that the inquiry could not have any application to him ; at all events , he tendered no reply .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 17]: Mr. Giles directed an appealing glance at the tinker ; but he had suddenly fallen asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 8]: The women were out of the question .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 34]: ` If Brittles would rather open the door , in the presence of witnesses , ' said Mr. Giles , after a short silence , ' I am ready to make one . '
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 21]: ` So am I , ' said the tinker , waking up , as suddenly as he had fallen asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 41]: Brittles capitualated on these terms ; and the party being somewhat re-assured by the discovery -LRB- made on throwing open the shutters -RRB- that it was now broad day , took their way upstairs ; with the dogs in front .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 16]: The two women , who were afraid to stay below , brought up the rear .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 62]: By the advice of Mr. Giles , they all talked very loud , to warn any evil-disposed person outside , that they were strong in numbers ; and by a master-stoke of policy , originating in the brain of the same ingenious gentleman , the dogs ' tails were well pinched , in the hall , to make them bark savagely .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 40]: These precautions having been taken , Mr. Giles held on fast by the tinker 's arm -LRB- to prevent his running away , as he pleasantly said -RRB- , and gave the word of command to open the door .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 42]: Brittles obeyed ; the group , peeping timourously over each other 's shoulders , beheld no more formidable object than poor little Oliver Twist , speechless and exhausted , who raised his heavy eyes , and mutely solicited their compassion . '
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 4]: A boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 13]: exclaimed Mr. Giles , valiantly , pushing the tinker into the background .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 10]: ` What 's the matter with the -- eh ?
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 14]: -- Why -- Brittles -- look here -- do n't you know ? '
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 24]: Brittles , who had got behind the door to open it , no sooner saw Oliver , than he uttered a loud cry .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 37]: Mr. Giles , seizing the boy by one leg and one arm -LRB- fortunately not the broken limb -RRB- lugged him straight into the hall , and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 6]: ` Here he is ! '
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 25]: bawled Giles , calling in a state of great excitement , up the staircase ; ` here 's one of the thieves , ma'am !
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 7]: Here 's a thief , miss !
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 4]: Wounded , miss !
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 14]: I shot him , miss ; and Brittles held the light . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 30]: -- In a lantern , miss , ' cried Brittles , applying one hand to the side of his mouth , so that his voice might travel the better .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 38]: The two women-servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that Mr. Giles had captured a robber ; and the tinker busied himself in endeavouring to restore Oliver , lest he should die before he could be hanged .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 25]: In the midst of all this noise and commotion , there was heard a sweet female voice , which quelled it in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 4]: ` Giles ! '
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 7]: whispered the voice from the stair-head .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 12]: ` I 'm here , miss , ' replied Mr. Giles .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 14]: ` Do n't be frightened , miss ; I ai n't much injured .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 11]: He did n't make a very desperate resistance , miss !
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 9]: I was soon too many for him . '
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 17]: replied the young lady ; ` you frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 8]: Is the poor creature much hurt ? '
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 14]: ` Wounded desperate , miss , ' replied Giles , with indescribable complacency .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 22]: ` He looks as if he was a-going , miss , ' bawled Brittles , in the same manner as before .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 20]: ` Would n't you like to come and look at him , miss , in case he should ? '
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 12]: ` Hush , pray ; there 's a good man ! '
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 4]: rejoined the lady .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 14]: ` Wait quietly only one instant , while I speak to aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 16]: With a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice , the speaker tripped away .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 58]: She soon returned , with the direction that the wounded person was to be carried , carefully , upstairs to Mr. Giles 's room ; and that Brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to Chertsey : from which place , he was to despatch , with all speed , a constable and doctor .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 16]: ` But wo n't you take one look at him , first , miss ? '
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 25]: asked Mr. Giles , with as much pride as if Oliver were some bird of rare plumage , that he had skilfully brought down .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 9]: ` Not one little peep , miss ? '
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 14]: ` Not now , for the world , ' replied the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 4]: ` Poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 10]: treat him kindly , Giles for my sake ! '
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 30]: The old servant looked up at the speaker , as she turned away , with a glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 22]: Then , bending over Oliver , he helped to carry him upstairs , with the care and solicitude of a woman .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 47]: CHAPTER XXIX HAS AN INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE , TO WHICH OLIVER RESORTED In a handsome room : though its furniture had rather the air of old-fashioned comfort , than of modern elegance : there sat two ladies at a well-spread breakfast-table .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 20]: Mr. Giles , dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of black , was in attendance upon them .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 84]: He had taken his station some half-way between the side-board and the breakfast-table ; and , with his body drawn up to its full height , his head thrown back , and inclined the merest trifle on one side , his left leg advanced , and his right hand thrust into his waist-coat , while his left hung down by his side , grasping a waiter , looked like one who laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 29]: Of the two ladies , one was well advanced in years ; but the high-backed oaken chair in which she sat , was not more upright than she .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 58]: Dressed with the utmost nicety and precision , in a quaint mixture of by-gone costume , with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste , which rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its effect , she sat , in a stately manner , with her hands folded on the table before her .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 20]: Her eyes -LRB- and age had dimmed but little of their brightness -RRB- were attentively upon her young companion .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 48]: The younger lady was in the lovely bloom and spring-time of womanhood ; at that age , when , if ever angels be for God 's good purposes enthroned in mortal forms , they may be , without impiety , supposed to abide in such as hers .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 6]: She was not past seventeen .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 34]: Cast in so slight and exquisite a mould ; so mild and gentle ; so pure and beautiful ; that earth seemed not her element , nor its rough creatures her fit companions .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 79]: The very intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye , and was stamped upon her noble head , seemed scarcely of her age , or of the world ; and yet the changing expression of sweetness and good humour , the thousand lights that played about the face , and left no shadow there ; above all , the smile , the cheerful , happy smile , were made for Home , and fireside peace and happiness .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 12]: She was busily engaged in the little offices of the table .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 55]: Chancing to raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her , she playfully put back her hair , which was simply braided on her forehead ; and threw into her beaming look , such an expression of affection and artless loveliness , that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 15]: ` And Brittles has been gone upwards of an hour , has he ? '
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 9]: asked the old lady , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 29]: ` An hour and twelve minutes , ma'am , ' replied Mr. Giles , referring to a silver watch , which he drew forth by a black ribbon .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 12]: ` He is always slow , ' remarked the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 15]: ` Brittles always was a slow boy , ma'am , ' replied the attendant .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 33]: And seeing , by the bye , that Brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of thirty years , there appeared no great probability of his ever being a fast one .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 17]: ` He gets worse instead of better , I think , ' said the elder lady .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 25]: ` It is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys , ' said the young lady , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 70]: Mr. Giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a respectful smile himself , when a gig drove up to the garden-gate : out of which there jumped a fat gentleman , who ran straight up to the door : and who , getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process , burst into the room , and nearly overturned Mr. Giles and the breakfast-table together . '
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 9]: I never heard of such a thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 5]: exclaimed the fat gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 28]: ` My dear Mrs. Maylie -- bless my soul -- in the silence of the night , too -- I NEVER heard of such a thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 27]: With these expressions of condolence , the fat gentleman shook hands with both ladies , and drawing up a chair , inquired how they found themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 19]: ` You ought to be dead ; positively dead with the fright , ' said the fat gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 7]: ` Why did n't you send ?
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 36]: Bless me , my man should have come in a minute ; and so would I ; and my assistant would have been delighted ; or anybody , I 'm sure , under such circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 4]: Dear , dear !
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 3]: So unexpected !
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 10]: In the silence of the night , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 55]: The doctor seemed expecially troubled by the fact of the robbery having been unexpected , and attempted in the night-time ; as if it were the established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact business at noon , and to make an appointment , by post , a day or two previous .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 25]: ` And you , Miss Rose , ' said the doctor , turning to the young lady , ` I -- ' ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 30]: very much so , indeed , ' said Rose , interrupting him ; ` but there is a poor creature upstairs , whom aunt wishes you to see . '
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 14]: to be sure , ' replied the doctor , ` so there is .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 11]: That was your handiwork , Giles , I understand . '
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 26]: Mr. Giles , who had been feverishly putting the tea-cups to rights , blushed very red , and said that he had had that honour .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 6]: ` Honour , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 35]: said the doctor ; ` well , I do n't know ; perhaps it 's as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen , as to hit your man at twelve paces .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 18]: Fancy that he fired in the air , and you 've fought a duel , Giles . '
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 49]: Mr. Giles , who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust attempt at diminishing his glory , answered respectfully , that it was not for the like of him to judge about that ; but he rather thought it was no joke to the opposite party .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 8]: ` Gad , that 's true ! '
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 4]: said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 5]: ` Where is he ?
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 5]: Show me the way .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 14]: I 'll look in again , as I come down , Mrs. Maylie .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 13]: That 's the little window that he got in at , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 10]: Well , I could n't have believed it ! '
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 90]: Talking all the way , he followed Mr. Giles upstairs ; and while he is going upstairs , the reader may be informed , that Mr. Losberne , a surgeon in the neighbourhood , known through a circuit of ten miles round as ` the doctor , ' had grown fat , more from good-humour than from good living : and was as kind and hearty , and withal as eccentric an old bachelor , as will be found in five times that space , by any explorer alive .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 16]: The doctor was absent , much longer than either he or the ladies had anticipated .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 45]: A large flat box was fetched out of the gig ; and a bedroom bell was rung very often ; and the servants ran up and down stairs perpetually ; from which tokens it was justly concluded that something important was going on above .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 27]: At length he returned ; and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his patient ; looked very mysterious , and closed the door , carefully .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 31]: ` This is a very extraordinary thing , Mrs. Maylie , ' said the doctor , standing with his back to the door , as if to keep it shut .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 11]: ` He is not in danger , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 5]: said the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 29]: ` Why , that would NOT be an extraordinary thing , under the circumstances , ' replied the doctor ; ` though I do n't think he is .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 7]: Have you seen the thief ? '
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 9]: ` No , ' rejoined the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 8]: ` Nor heard anything about him ? '
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 5]: ` No . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 28]: I beg your pardon , ma'am , interposed Mr. Giles ; ` but I was going to tell you about him when Doctor Losberne came in . '
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 31]: The fact was , that Mr. Giles had not , at first , been able to bring his mind to the avowal , that he had only shot a boy .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 48]: Such commendations had been bestowed upon his bravery , that he could not , for the life of him , help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes ; during which he had flourished , in the very zenith of a brief reputation for undaunted courage .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 23]: ` Rose wished to see the man , ' said Mrs. Maylie , ` but I would n't hear of it . '
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 4]: ` Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 4]: rejoined the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 10]: ` There is nothing very alarming in his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 12]: Have you any objection to see him in my presence ? '
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 17]: ` If it be necessary , ' replied the old lady , ` certainly not . '
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 37]: ` Then I think it is necessary , ' said the doctor ; ` at all events , I am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so , if you postponed it .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 8]: He is perfectly quiet and comfortable now .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 11]: Allow me -- Miss Rose , will you permit me ?
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 12]: Not the slightest fear , I pledge you my honour ! '
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 61]: CHAPTER XXX RELATES WHAT OLIVER 'S NEW VISITORS THOUGHT OF HIM With many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised in the aspect of the criminal , the doctor drew the young lady 's arm through one of him ; and offering his disengaged hand to Mrs. Maylie , led them , with much ceremony and stateliness , upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 32]: ` Now , ' said the doctor , in a whisper , as he softly turned the handle of a bedroom-door , ` let us hear what you think of him .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 18]: He has not been shaved very recently , but he do n't look at all ferocious notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 4]: Stop , though !
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 12]: Let me first see that he is in visiting order . '
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 10]: Stepping before them , he looked into the room .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 24]: Motioning them to advance , he closed the door when they had entered ; and gently drew back the curtains of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 36]: Upon it , in lieu of the dogged , black-visaged ruffian they had expected to behold , there lay a mere child : worn with pain and exhaustion , and sunk into a deep sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 39]: His wounded arm , bound and splintered up , was crossed upon his breast ; his head reclined upon the other arm , which was half hidden by his long hair , as it streamed over the pillow .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 23]: The honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand , and looked on , for a minute or so , in silence .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 33]: Whilst he was watching the patient thus , the younger lady glided softly past , and seating herself in a chair by the bedside , gathered Oliver 's hair from his face .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 13]: As she stooped over him , her tears fell upon his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 33]: The boy stirred , and smiled in his sleep , as though these marks of pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he had never known .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 86]: Thus , a strain of gentle music , or the rippling of water in a silent place , or the odour of a flower , or the mention of a familiar word , will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were , in this life ; which vanish like a breath ; which some brief memory of a happier existence , long gone by , would seem to have awakened ; which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 7]: ` What can this mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 5]: exclaimed the elder lady .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 14]: ` This poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers ! '
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 35]: ` Vice , ' said the surgeon , replacing the curtain , ` takes up her abode in many temples ; and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine her ? '
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 9]: ` But at so early an age ! '
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 3]: urged Rose .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 32]: ` My dear young lady , ' rejoined the surgeon , mournfully shaking his head ; ` crime , like death , is not confined to the old and withered alone .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 12]: The youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims . '
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 8]: ` But , can you -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 21]: can you really believe that this delicate boy has been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society ? '
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 3]: said Rose .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 36]: The surgeon shook his head , in a manner which intimated that he feared it was very possible ; and observing that they might disturb the patient , led the way into an adjoining apartment .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 65]: ` But even if he has been wicked , ' pursued Rose , ` think how young he is ; think that he may never have known a mother 's love , or the comfort of a home ; that ill-usage and blows , or the want of bread , may have driven him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 41]: Aunt , dear aunt , for mercy 's sake , think of this , before you let them drag this sick child to a prison , which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of amendment .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 54]: as you love me , and know that I have never felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection , but that I might have done so , and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child , have pity upon him before it is too late ! '
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 35]: ` My dear love , ' said the elder lady , as she folded the weeping girl to her bosom , ` do you think I would harm a hair of his head ? '
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 6]: ` Oh , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 5]: replied Rose , eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 34]: ` No , surely , ' said the old lady ; ` my days are drawing to their close : and may mercy be shown to me as I show it to others !
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 11]: What can I do to save him , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 18]: ` Let me think , ma'am , ' said the doctor ; ` let me think . '
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 33]: Mr. Losberne thrust his hands into his pockets , and took several turns up and down the room ; often stopping , and balancing himself on his toes , and frowning frightfully .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 71]: After various exclamations of ` I 've got it now ' and ` no , I have n't , ' and as many renewals of the walking and frowning , he at length made a dead halt , and spoke as follows : ' I think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully Giles , and that little boy , Brittles , I can manage it .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 37]: Giles is a faithful fellow and an old servant , I know ; but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways , and reward him for being such a good shot besides .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 8]: You do n't object to that ? '
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 17]: ` Unless there is some other way of preserving the child , ' replied Mrs. Maylie .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 11]: ` There is no other , ' said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 11]: ` No other , take my word for it . '
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 36]: ` Then my aunt invests you with full power , ' said Rose , smiling through her tears ; ` but pray do n't be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary . '
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 27]: ` You seem to think , ' retorted the doctor , ` that everybody is disposed to be hard-hearted to-day , except yourself , Miss Rose .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 71]: I only hope , for the sake of the rising male sex generally , that you may be found in as vulnerable and soft-hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow who appeals to your compassion ; and I wish I were a young fellow , that I might avail myself , on the spot , of such a favourable opportunity for doing so , as the present . '
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 18]: ` You are as great a boy as poor Brittles himself , ' returned Rose , blushing .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 19]: ` Well , ' said the doctor , laughing heartily , ` that is no very difficult matter .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 7]: But to return to this boy .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 11]: The great point of our agreement is yet to come .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 48]: He will wake in an hour or so , I dare say ; and although I have told that thick-headed constable-fellow downstairs that he mus n't be moved or spoken to , on peril of his life , I think we may converse with him without danger .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 78]: Now I make this stipulation -- that I shall examine him in your presence , and that , if , from what he says , we judge , and I can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason , that he is a real and thorough bad one -LRB- which is more than possible -RRB- , he shall be left to his fate , without any farther interference on my part , at all events . '
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 7]: ` Oh no , aunt ! '
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 3]: entreated Rose .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 7]: ` Oh yes , aunt ! '
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 4]: said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 6]: ` Is is a bargain ?
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 20]: ; ` He can not be hardened in vice , ' said Rose ; ` It is impossible . '
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 23]: ` Very good , ' retorted the doctor ; ` then so much the more reason for acceding to my proposition . '
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 25]: Finally the treaty was entered into ; and the parties thereunto sat down to wait , with some impatience , until Oliver should awake .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 35]: The patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial than Mr. Losberne had led them to expect ; for hour after hour passed on , and still Oliver slumbered heavily .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 27]: It was evening , indeed , before the kind-hearted doctor brought them the intelligence , that he was at length sufficiently restored to be spoken to .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 58]: The boy was very ill , he said , and weak from the loss of blood ; but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to disclose something , that he deemed it better to give him the opportunity , than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next morning : which he should otherwise have done .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 7]: The conference was a long one .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 22]: Oliver told them all his simple history , and was often compelled to stop , by pain and want of strength .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 37]: It was a solemn thing , to hear , in the darkened room , the feeble voice of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which hard men had brought upon him .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 112]: if when we oppress and grind our fellow-creatures , we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of human error , which , like dense and heavy clouds , are rising , slowly it is true , but not less surely , to Heaven , to pour their after-vengeance on our heads ; if we heard but one instant , in imagination , the deep testimony of dead men 's voices , which no power can stifle , and no pride shut out ; where would be the injury and injustice , the suffering , misery , cruelty , and wrong , that each day 's life brings with it !
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 21]: Oliver 's pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night ; and loveliness and virtue watched him as he slept .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 14]: He felt calm and happy , and could have died without a murmur .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 43]: The momentous interview was no sooner concluded , and Oliver composed to rest again , than the doctor , after wiping his eyes , and condemning them for being weak all at once , betook himself downstairs to open upon Mr. Giles .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 33]: And finding nobody about the parlours , it occurred to him , that he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen ; so into the kitchen he went .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 52]: There were assembled , in that lower house of the domestic parliament , the women-servants , Mr. Brittles , Mr. Giles , the tinker -LRB- who had received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of the day , in consideration of his services -RRB- , and the constable .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 39]: The latter gentleman had a large staff , a large head , large features , and large half-boots ; and he looked as if he had been taking a proportionate allowance of ale -- as indeed he had .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 49]: The adventures of the previous night were still under discussion ; for Mr. Giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind , when the doctor entered ; Mr. Brittles , with a mug of ale in his hand , was corroborating everything , before his superior said it .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 5]: ` Sit still ! '
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 8]: said the doctor , waving his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 10]: ` Thank you , sir , said Mr. Giles .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 42]: ` Misses wished some ale to be given out , sir ; and as I felt no ways inclined for my own little room , sir , and was disposed for company , I am taking mine among 'em here . '
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 27]: Brittles headed a low murmur , by which the ladies and gentlemen generally were understood to express the gratification they derived from Mr. Giles 's condescension .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 28]: Mr. Giles looked round with a patronising air , as much as to say that so long as they behaved properly , he would never desert them .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 10]: ` How is the patient to-night , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 3]: asked Giles .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 9]: ` So-so ' ; returned the doctor . '
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 17]: I am afraid you have got yourself into a scrape there , Mr. Giles . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 26]: I hope you do n't mean to say , sir , ' said Mr. Giles , trembling , ` that he 's going to die .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 12]: If I thought it , I should never be happy again .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 27]: I would n't cut a boy off : no , not even Brittles here ; not for all the plate in the county , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 14]: ` That 's not the point , ' said the doctor , mysteriously .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 10]: ` Mr. Giles , are you a Protestant ? '
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 20]: ` Yes , sir , I hope so , ' faltered Mr. Giles , who had turned very pale .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 9]: ` And what are YOU , boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 9]: said the doctor , turning sharply upon Brittles .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 8]: ` Lord bless me , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 18]: replied Brittles , starting violently ; ` I 'm the same as Mr. Giles , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 20]: ` Then tell me this , ' said the doctor , ` both of you , both of you !
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 27]: Are you going to take upon yourselves to swear , that that boy upstairs is the boy that was put through the little window last night ?
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 4]: Out with it !
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 7]: We are prepared for you ! '
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 50]: The doctor , who was universally considered one of the best-tempered creatures on earth , made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger , that Giles and Brittles , who were considerably muddled by ale and excitement , stared at each other in a state of stupefaction .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 13]: ` Pay attention to the reply , constable , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 34]: said the doctor , shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner , and tapping the bridge of his nose with it , to bespeak the exercise of that worthy 's utmost acuteness .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 10]: ` Something may come of this before long . '
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 26]: The constable looked as wise as he could , and took up his staff of office : which had been recling indolently in the chimney-corner .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 18]: ` It 's a simple question of identity , you will observe , ' said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 39]: ` That 's what it is , sir , ' replied the constable , coughing with great violence ; for he had finished his ale in a hurry , and some of it had gone the wrong way .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 45]: ` Here 's the house broken into , ' said the doctor , ` and a couple of men catch one moment 's glimpse of a boy , in the midst of gunpowder smoke , and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 52]: Here 's a boy comes to that very same house , next morning , and because he happens to have his arm tied up , these men lay violent hands upon him -- by doing which , they place his life in great danger -- and swear he is the thief .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 27]: Now , the question is , whether these men are justified by the fact ; if not , in what situation do they place themselves ? '
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 5]: The constable nodded profoundly .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 19]: He said , if that was n't law , he would be glad to know what was . '
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 26]: I ask you again , ' thundered the doctor , ` are you , on your solemn oaths , able to identify that boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 65]: Brittles looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles ; Mr. Giles looked doubtfully at Brittles ; the constable put his hand behind his ear , to catch the reply ; the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen ; the doctor glanced keenly round ; when a ring was heard at the gate , and at the same moment , the sound of wheels .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 7]: ` It 's the runners ! '
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 9]: cried Brittles , to all appearance much relieved .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 5]: ` The what ? '
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 9]: exclaimed the doctor , aghast in his turn .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 29]: ` The Bow Street officers , sir , ' replied Brittles , taking up a candle ; ` me and Mr. Giles sent for 'em this morning . '
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 4]: ` What ? '
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 4]: cried the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 30]: ` Yes , ' replied Brittles ; ' I sent a message up by the coachman , and I only wonder they were n't here before , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 7]: ` You did , did you ?
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 21]: Then confound your -- slow coaches down here ; that 's all , ' said the doctor , walking away .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 12]: CHAPTER XXXI INVOLVES A CRITICAL POSITION ` Who 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 26]: inquired Brittles , opening the door a little way , with the chain up , and peeping out , shading the candle with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 27]: ` Open the door , ' replied a man outside ; ` it 's the officers from Bow Street , as was sent to to-day . '
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 49]: Much comforted by this assurance , Brittles opened the door to its full width , and confronted a portly man in a great-coat ; who walked in , without saying anything more , and wiped his shoes on the mat , as coolly as if he lived there .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 17]: ` Just send somebody out to relieve my mate , will you , young man ? '
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 15]: said the officer ; ` he 's in the gig , a-minding the prad .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 24]: Have you got a coach ` us here , that you could put it up in , for five or ten minutes ? '
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 43]: Brittles replying in the affirmative , and pointing out the building , the portly man stepped back to the garden-gate , and helped his companion to put up the gig : while Brittles lighted them , in a state of great admiration .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 31]: This done , they returned to the house , and , being shown into a parlour , took off their great-coats and hats , and showed like what they were .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 40]: The man who had knocked at the door , was a stout personage of middle height , aged about fifty : with shiny black hair , cropped pretty close ; half-whiskers , a round face , and sharp eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 24]: The other was a red-headed , bony man , in top-boots ; with a rather ill-favoured countenance , and a turned-up sinister-looking nose .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 15]: ` Tell your governor that Blathers and Duff is here , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 20]: said the stouter man , smoothing down his hair , and laying a pair of handcuffs on the table .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 4]: Good-evening , master .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 17]: Can I have a word or two with you in private , if you please ? '
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 32]: This was addressed to Mr. Losberne , who now made his appearance ; that gentleman , motioning Brittles to retire , brought in the two ladies , and shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 19]: ` This is the lady of the house , ' said Mr. Losberne , motioning towards Mrs. Maylie .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 6]: Mr. Blathers made a bow .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 27]: Being desired to sit down , he put his hat on the floor , and taking a chair , motioned to Duff to do the same .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 57]: The latter gentleman , who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good society , or quite so much at his ease in it -- one of the two -- seated himself , after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs , and the head of his stick into his mouth , with some embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 16]: ` Now , with regard to this here robbery , master , ' said Blathers .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 7]: ` What are the circumstances ? '
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 21]: Mr. Losberne , who appeared desirous of gaining time , recounted them at great length , and with much circumlocution .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 16]: Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked very knowing meanwhile , and occasionally exchanged a nod . '
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 55]: I ca n't say , for certain , till I see the work , of course , ' said Blathers ; ` but my opinion at once is , -- I do n't mind committing myself to that extent , -- that this was n't done by a yokel ; eh , Duff ? '
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 8]: ` Certainly not , ' replied Duff .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 32]: ` And , translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies , I apprehend your meaning to be , that this attempt was not made by a countryman ? '
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 8]: said Mr. Losberne , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 11]: ` That 's it , master , ' replied Blathers .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 12]: ` This is all about the robbery , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 8]: ` All , ' replied the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 19]: ` Now , what is this , about this here boy that the servants are a-talking on ? '
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 3]: said Blathers .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 10]: ` Nothing at all , ' replied the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 38]: ` One of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head , that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house ; but it 's nonsense : sheer absurdity . '
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 14]: ` Wery easy disposed of , if it is , ' remarked Duff .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 36]: ` What he says is quite correct , ' observed Blathers , nodding his head in a confirmatory way , and playing carelessly with the handcuffs , as if they were a pair of castanets .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 6]: ` Who is the boy ?
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 8]: What account does he give of himself ?
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 6]: Where did he come from ?
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 15]: He did n't drop out of the clouds , did he , master ? '
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 20]: ` Of course not , ' replied the doctor , with a nervous glance at the two ladies . '
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 14]: I know his whole history : but we can talk about that presently .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 21]: You would like , first , to see the place where the thieves made their attempt , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 8]: ` Certainly , ' rejoined Mr. Blathers .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 15]: ` We had better inspect the premises first , and examine the servants afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 10]: That 's the usual way of doing business . '
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 101]: Lights were then procured ; and Messrs. Blathers and Duff , attended by the native constable , Brittles , Giles , and everybody else in short , went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at the window ; and afterwards went round by way of the lawn , and looked in at the window ; and after that , had a candle handed out to inspect the shutter with ; and after that , a lantern to trace the footsteps with ; and after that , a pitchfork to poke the bushes with .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 71]: This done , amidst the breathless interest of all beholders , they came in again ; and Mr. Giles and Brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of their share in the previous night 's adventures : which they performed some six times over : contradiction each other , in not more than one important respect , the first time , and in not more than a dozen the last .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 48]: This consummation being arrived at , Blathers and Duff cleared the room , and held a long council together , compared with which , for secrecy and solemnity , a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest point in medicine , would be mere child 's play .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 29]: Meanwhile , the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy state ; and Mrs. Maylie and Rose looked on , with anxious faces .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 31]: ` Upon my word , ' he said , making a halt , after a great number of very rapid turns , ' I hardly know what to do . '
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 29]: ` Surely , ' said Rose , ` the poor child 's story , faithfully repeated to these men , will be sufficient to exonerate him . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 19]: I doubt it , my dear young lady , ' said the doctor , shaking his head . '
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 22]: I do n't think it would exonerate him , either with them , or with legal functionaries of a higher grade .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 11]: What is he , after all , they would say ?
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 3]: A runaway .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 17]: Judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities , his story is a very doubtful one . '
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 8]: ` You believe it , surely ? '
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 4]: interrupted Rose . '
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 45]: I believe it , strange as it is ; and perhaps I may be an old fool for doing so , ' rejoined the doctor ; ` but I do n't think it is exactly the tale for a practical police-officer , nevertheless . '
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 5]: ` Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 3]: demanded Rose .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 46]: ` Because , my pretty cross-examiner , ' replied the doctor : ` because , viewed with their eyes , there are many ugly points about it ; he can only prove the parts that look ill , and none of those that look well .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 20]: Confound the fellows , they WILL have the way and the wherefore , and will take nothing for granted .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 77]: On his own showing , you see , he has been the companion of thieves for some time past ; he has been carried to a police-officer , on a charge of picking a gentleman 's pocket ; he has been taken away , forcibly , from that gentleman 's house , to a place which he can not describe or point out , and of the situation of which he has not the remotest idea .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 86]: He is brought down to Chertsey , by men who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him , whether he will or no ; and is put through a window to rob a house ; and then , just at the very moment when he is going to alarm the inmates , and so do the very thing that would set him all to rights , there rushes into the way , a blundering dog of a half-bred butler , and shoots him !
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 13]: As if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself !
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 9]: Do n't you see all this ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 36]: I see it , of course , ' replied Rose , smiling at the doctor 's impetuosity ; ` but still I do not see anything in it , to criminate the poor child . '
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 13]: ` No , ' replied the doctor ; ` of course not !
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 8]: Bless the bright eyes of your sex !
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 34]: They never see , whether for good or bad , more than one side of any question ; and that is , always , the one which first presents itself to them . '
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 32]: Having given vent to this result of experience , the doctor put his hands into his pockets , and walked up and down the room with even greater rapidity than before .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 40]: ` The more I think of it , ' said the doctor , ` the more I see that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in possession of the boy 's real story .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 58]: I am certain it will not be believed ; and even if they can do nothing to him in the end , still the dragging it forward , and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it , must interfere , materially , with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery . '
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 7]: what is to be done ? '
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 3]: cried Rose .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 5]: ` Dear , dear !
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 8]: whyddid they send for these people ? '
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 6]: ` Why , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 5]: exclaimed Mrs. Maylie . '
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 13]: I would not have had them here , for the world . '
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 37]: ` All I know is , ' said Mr. Losberne , at last : sitting down with a kind of desperate calmness , ` that we must try and carry it off with a bold face .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 14]: The object is a good one , and that must be our excuse .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 27]: The boy has strong symptoms of fever upon him , and is in no condition to be talked to any more ; that 's one comfort .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 22]: We must make the best of it ; and if bad be the best , it is no fault of ours .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 4]: Come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 29]: ` Well , master , ' said Blathers , entering the room followed by his colleague , and making the door fast , before he said any more .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 9]: ` This war n't a put-up thing . '
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 11]: ` And what the devil 's a put-up thing ? '
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 6]: demanded the doctor , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 43]: ` We call it a put-up robbery , ladies , ' said Blathers , turning to them , as if he pitied their ignorance , but had a contempt for the doctor 's , ` when the servants is in it . '
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 14]: ` Nobody suspected them , in this case , ' said Mrs. Maylie .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 25]: ` Wery likely not , ma'am , ' replied Blathers ; ` but they might have been in it , for all that . '
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 12]: ` More likely on that wery account , ' said Duff .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 27]: ` We find it was a town hand , ' said Blathers , continuing his report ; ` for the style of work is first-rate . '
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 15]: ` Wery pretty indeed it is , ' remarked Duff , in an undertone .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 32]: ` There was two of 'em in it , ' continued Blathers ; ` and they had a boy with 'em ; that 's plain from the size of the window .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 9]: That 's all to be said at present .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 18]: We 'll see this lad that you 've got upstairs at once , if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 14]: ` Perhaps they will take something to drink first , Mrs. Maylie ? '
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 18]: said the doctor : his face brightening , as if some new thought had occurred to him .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 5]: to be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 5]: exclaimed Rose , eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 12]: ` You shall have it immediately , if you will . '
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 9]: ` Why , thank you , miss ! '
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 21]: said Blathers , drawing his coat-sleeve across his mouth ; ` it 's dry work , this sort of duty .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 21]: Anythink that 's handy , miss ; do n't put yourself out of the way , on our accounts . '
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 7]: ` What shall it be ? '
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 13]: asked the doctor , following the young lady to the sideboard . '
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 19]: A little drop of spirits , master , if it 's all the same , ' replied Blathers .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 25]: ` It 's a cold ride from London , ma'am ; and I always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings . '
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 15]: This interesting communication was addressed to Mrs. Maylie , who received it very graciously .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 16]: While it was being conveyed to her , the doctor slipped out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 55]: said Mr. Blathers : not holding his wine-glass by the stem , but grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand : and placing it in front of his chest ; ' I have seen a good many pieces of business like this , in my time , ladies . '
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 24]: ` That crack down in the back lane at Edmonton , Blathers , ' said Mr. Duff , assisting his colleague 's memory .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 13]: ` That was something in this way , war n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 16]: rejoined Mr. Blathers ; ` that was done by Conkey Chickweed , that was . '
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 11]: ` You always gave that to him ' replied Duff .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 11]: ` It was the Family Pet , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 14]: Conkey had n't any more to do with it than I had . '
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 5]: ` Get out ! '
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 9]: retorted Mr. Blathers ; ' I know better .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 15]: Do you mind that time when Conkey was robbed of his money , though ?
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 6]: What a start that was !
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 9]: Better than any novel-book I ever see ! '
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 6]: ` What was that ? '
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 15]: inquired Rose : anxious to encourage any symptoms of good-humour in the unwelcome visitors .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 21]: ` It was a robbery , miss , that hardly anybody would have been down upon , ' said Blathers .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 18]: ` This here Conkey Chickweed -- ' ` Conkey means Nosey , ma'am , ' interposed Duff .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 13]: ` Of course the lady knows that , do n't she ? '
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 4]: demanded Mr. Blathers .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 9]: ` Always interrupting , you are , partner !
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 57]: This here Conkey Chickweed , miss , kept a public-house over Battlebridge way , and he had a cellar , where a good many young lords went to see cock-fighting , and badger-drawing , and that ; and a wery intellectural manner the sports was conducted in , for I 've seen 'em off ` en .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 81]: He war n't one of the family , at that time ; and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twenty-seven guineas in a canvas bag , that was stole out of his bedrrom in the dead of night , by a tall man with a black patch over his eye , who had concealed himself under the bed , and after committing the robbery , jumped slap out of window : which was only a story high .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 7]: He was wery quick about it .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 20]: But Conkey was quick , too ; for he fired a blunderbuss arter him , and roused the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 49]: They set up a hue-and-cry , directly , and when they came to look about 'em , found that Conkey had hit the robber ; for there was traces of blood , all the way to some palings a good distance off ; and there they lost 'em .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 108]: However , he had made off with the blunt ; and , consequently , the name of Mr. Chickweed , licensed witler , appeared in the Gazette among the other bankrupts ; and all manner of benefits and subscriptions , and I do n't know what all , was got up for the poor man , who was in a wery low state of mind about his loss , and went up and down the streets , for three or four days , a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 66]: One day he came up to the office , all in a hurry , and had a private interview with the magistrate , who , after a deal of talk , rings the bell , and orders Jem Spyers in -LRB- Jem was a active officer -RRB- , and tells him to go and assist Mr. Chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 31]: `` I see him , Spyers , '' said Chickweed , `` pass my house yesterday morning , '' `` Why did n't you up , and collar him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 3]: says Spyers .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 49]: `` I was so struck all of a heap , that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick , '' says the poor man ; `` but we 're sure to have him ; for between ten and eleven o'clock at night he passed again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 70]: Spyers no sooner heard this , than he put some clean linen and a comb , in his pocket , in case he should have to stop a day or two ; and away he goes , and sets himself down at one of the public-house windows behind the little red curtain , with his hat on , all ready to bolt out , at a moment 's notice .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 25]: He was smoking his pipe here , late at night , when all of a sudden Chickweed roars out , `` Here he is !
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 3]: Stop thief !
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 3]: Murder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 18]: Jem Spyers dashes out ; and there he sees Chickweed , a-tearing down the street full cry .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 21]: Away goes Spyers ; on goes Chickweed ; round turns the people ; everybody roars out , `` Thieves ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 14]: and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting , all the time , like mad .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 31]: Spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner ; shoots round ; sees a little crowd ; dives in ; `` Which is the man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 6]: `` D -- me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 11]: says Chickweed , `` I 've lost him again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 23]: It was a remarkable occurrence , but he war n't to be seen nowhere , so they went back to the public-house .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 38]: Next morning , Spyers took his old place , and looked out , from behind the curtain , for a tall man with a black patch over his eye , till his own two eyes ached again .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 36]: At last , he could n't help shutting 'em , to ease 'em a minute ; and the very moment he did so , he hears Chickweed a-roaring out , `` Here he is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 35]: Off he starts once more , with Chickweed half-way down the street ahead of him ; and after twice as long a run as the yesterday 's one , the man 's lost again !
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 49]: This was done , once or twice more , till one-half the neighbours gave out that Mr. Chickweed had been robbed by the devil , who was playing tricks with him arterwards ; and the other half , that poor Mr. Chickweed had gone mad with grief . '
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 8]: ` What did Jem Spyers say ? '
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 18]: inquired the doctor ; who had returned to the room shortly after the commencement of the story .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 34]: ` Jem Spyers , ' resumed the officer , ` for a long time said nothing at all , and listened to everything without seeming to , which showed he understood his business .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 32]: But , one morning , he walked into the bar , and taking out his snuffbox , says `` Chickweed , I 've found out who done this here robbery . ''
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 5]: `` Have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 3]: said Chickweed .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 19]: `` Oh , my dear Spyers , only let me have wengeance , and I shall die contented !
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 12]: Oh , my dear Spyers , where is the villain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 4]: `` Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 16]: said Spyers , offering him a pinch of snuff , `` none of that gammon !
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 6]: You did it yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 41]: So he had ; and a good bit of money he had made by it , too ; and nobody would never have found it out , if he had n't been so precious anxious to keep up appearances ! '
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 15]: said Mr. Blathers , putting down his wine-glass , and clinking the handcuffs together .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 11]: ` Very curious , indeed , ' observed the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 13]: ` Now , if you please , you can walk upstairs . '
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 12]: ` If YOU please , sir , ' returned Mr. Blathers .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 25]: Closely following Mr. Losberne , the two officers ascended to Oliver 's bedroom ; Mr. Giles preceding the party , with a lighted candle .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 19]: Oliver had been dozing ; but looked worse , and was more feverish than he had appeared yet .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 50]: Being assisted by the doctor , he managed to sit up in bed for a minute or so ; and looked at the strangers without at all understanding what was going forward -- in fact , without seeming to recollect where he was , or what had been passing .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 93]: ` This , ' said Mr. Losberne , speaking softly , but with great vehemence notwithstanding , ` this is the lad , who , being accidently wounded by a spring-gun in some boyish trespass on Mr. What-d ' ye-call-him 's grounds , at the back here , comes to the house for assistance this morning , and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated , by that ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand : who has placed his life in considerable danger , as I can professionally certify . '
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 18]: Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked at Mr. Giles , as he was thus recommended to their notice .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 26]: The bewildered butler gazed from them towards Oliver , and from Oliver towards Mr. Losberne , with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 13]: ` You do n't mean to deny that , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 10]: said the doctor , laying Oliver gently down again .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 19]: ` It was all done for the -- for the best , sir , ' answered Giles . '
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 19]: I am sure I thought it was the boy , or I would n't have meddled with him .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 11]: I am not of an inhuman disposition , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 8]: ` Thought it was what boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 5]: inquired the senior officer .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 9]: ` The housebreaker 's boy , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 3]: replied Giles .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 10]: ` They -- they certainly had a boy . '
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 3]: ` Well ?
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 7]: Do you think so now ? '
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 3]: inquired Blathers .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 7]: ` Think what , now ? '
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 9]: replied Giles , looking vacantly at his questioner .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 11]: ` Think it 's the same boy , Stupid-head ? '
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 6]: rejoined Blathers , impatiently . '
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 21]: I do n't know ; I really do n't know , ' said Giles , with a rueful countenance . '
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 8]: I could n't swear to him . '
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 7]: ` What do you think ? '
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 5]: asked Mr. Blathers . '
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 14]: I do n't know what to think , ' replied poor Giles . '
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 20]: I do n't think it is the boy ; indeed , I 'm almost certain that it is n't .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 8]: You know it ca n't be . '
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 10]: ` Has this man been a-drinking , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 8]: inquired Blathers , turning to the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 10]: ` What a precious muddle-headed chap you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 11]: said Duff , addressing Mr. Giles , with supreme contempt .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 56]: Mr. Losberne had been feeling the patient 's pulse during this short dialogue ; but he now rose from the chair by the bedside , and remarked , that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject , they would perhaps like to step into the next room , and have Brittles before them .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 129]: Acting upon this suggestion , they adjourned to a neighbouring apartment , where Mr. Brittles , being called in , involved himself and his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions and impossibilities , as tended to throw no particular light on anything , but the fact of his own strong mystification ; except , indeed , his declarations that he should n't know the real boy , if he were put before him that instant ; that he had only taken Oliver to be he , because Mr. Giles had said he was ; and that Mr. Giles had , five minutes previously , admitted in the kitchen , that he begain to be very much afraid he had been a little too hasty .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 71]: Among other ingenious surmises , the question was then raised , whether Mr. Giles had really hit anybody ; and upon examination of the fellow pistol to that which he had fired , it turned out to have no more destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper : a discovery which made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor , who had drawn the ball about ten minutes before .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 51]: Upon no one , however , did it make a greater impression than on Mr. Giles himself ; who , after labouring , for some hours , under the fear of having mortally wounded a fellow-creature , eagerly caught at this new idea , and favoured it to the utmost .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 40]: Finally , the officers , without troubling themselves very much about Oliver , left the Chertsey constable in the house , and took up their rest for that night in the town ; promising to return the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 43]: With the next morning , there came a rumour , that two men and a boy were in the cage at Kingston , who had been apprehended over night under suspicious circumstances ; and to Kingston Messrs. Blathers and Duff journeyed accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 118]: The suspicious circumstances , however , resolving themselves , on investigation , into the one fact , that they had been discovered sleeping under a haystack ; which , although a great crime , is only punishable by imprisonment , and is , in the merciful eye of the English law , and its comprehensive love of all the King 's subjects , held to be no satisfactory proof , in the absence of all other evidence , that the sleeper , or sleepers , have committed burglary accompanied with violence , and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the punishment of death ; Messrs. Blathers and Duff came back again , as wise as they went .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 117]: In short , after some more examination , and a great deal more conversation , a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the joint bail of Mrs. Maylie and Mr. Losberne for Oliver 's appearance if he should ever be called upon ; and Blathers and Duff , being rewarded with a couple of guineas , returned to town with divided opinions on the subject of their expedition : the latter gentleman on a mature consideration of all the circumstances , inclining to the belief that the burglarious attempt had originated with the Family Pet ; and the former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the great Mr. Conkey Chickweed .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 23]: Meanwhile , Oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care of Mrs. Maylie , Rose , and the kind-hearted Mr. Losberne .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 26]: If fervent prayers , gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude , be heard in heaven -- and if they be not , what prayers are !
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 22]: -- the blessings which the orphan child called down upon them , sunk into their souls , diffusing peace and happiness .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 23]: CHAPTER XXXII OF THE HAPPY LIFE OLIVER BEGAN TO LEAD WITH HIS KIND FRIENDS Oliver 's ailings were neither slight nor few .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 40]: In addition to the pain and delay attendant on a broken limb , his exposure to the wet and cold had brought on fever and ague : which hung about him for many weeks , and reduced him sadly .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 132]: But , at length , he began , by slow degrees , to get better , and to be able to say sometimes , in a few tearful words , how deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies , and how ardently he hoped that when he grew strong and well again , he could do something to show his gratitude ; only something , which would let them see the love and duty with which his breast was full ; something , however slight , which would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not been cast away ; but that the poor boy whom their charity had rescued from misery , or death , was eager to serve them with his whole heart and soul .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 5]: ` Poor fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 38]: said Rose , when Oliver had been one day feebly endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale lips ; ` you shall have many opportunities of serving us , if you will .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 17]: We are going into the country , and my aunt intends that you shall accompany us .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 25]: The quiet place , the pure air , and all the pleasure and beauties of spring , will restore you in a few days .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 17]: We will employ you in a hundred ways , when you can bear the trouble . '
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 5]: ` The trouble ! '
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 3]: cried Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 52]: dear lady , if I could but work for you ; if I could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers , or watching your birds , or running up and down the whole day long , to make you happy ; what would I give to do it ! '
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 59]: ` You shall give nothing at all , ' said Miss Maylie , smiling ; ` for , as I told you before , we shall employ you in a hundred ways ; and if you only take half the trouble to please us , that you promise now , you will make me very happy indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 6]: ` Happy , ma'am ! '
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 13]: cried Oliver ; ` how kind of you to say so ! '
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 18]: ` You will make me happier than I can tell you , ' replied the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 67]: ` To think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing any one from such sad misery as you have described to us , would be an unspeakable pleasure to me ; but to know that the object of her goodness and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached , in consequence , would delight me , more than you can well imagine .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 6]: Do you understand me ? '
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 9]: she inquired , watching Oliver 's thoughtful face .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 9]: ` Oh yes , ma'am , yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 16]: replied Oliver eagerly ; ` but I was thinking that I am ungrateful now . '
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 5]: ` To whom ? '
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 5]: inquired the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 25]: ` To the kind gentleman , and the dear old nurse , who took so much care of me before , ' rejoined Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 20]: ` If they knew how happy I am , they would be pleased , I am sure . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 43]: I am sure they would , ' rejoined Oliver 's benefactress ; ` and Mr. Losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well enough to bear the journey , he will carry you to see them . '
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 7]: ` Has he , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 10]: cried Oliver , his face brightening with pleasure . '
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 20]: I do n't know what I shall do for joy when I see their kind faces once again ! '
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 16]: In a short time Oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the fatigue of this expedition .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 21]: One morning he and Mr. Losberne set out , accordingly , in a little carriage which belonged to Mrs. Maylie .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 18]: When they came to Chertsey Bridge , Oliver turned very pale , and uttered a loud exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 10]: ` What 's the matter with the boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 12]: cried the doctor , as usual , all in a bustle .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 15]: ` Do you see anything -- hear anything -- feel anything -- eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 16]: ` That , sir , ' cried Oliver , pointing out of the carriage window .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 5]: ` That house ! '
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 9]: ` Yes ; well , what of it ?
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 3]: Stop coachman .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 9]: Pull up here , ' cried the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 12]: ` What of the house , my man ; eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 12]: ` The thieves -- the house they took me to ! '
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 3]: whispered Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 7]: ` The devil it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 4]: cried the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 5]: ` Hallo , there !
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 5]: let me out ! '
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 43]: But , before the coachman could dismount from his box , he had tumbled out of the coach , by some means or other ; and , running down to the deserted tenement , began kicking at the door like a madman .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 4]: ` Halloa ? '
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 33]: said a little ugly hump-backed man : opening the door so suddenly , that the doctor , from the very impetus of his last kick , nearly fell forward into the passage .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 8]: ` What 's the matter here ? '
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 4]: ` Matter ! '
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 14]: exclaimed the other , collaring him , without a moment 's reflection . '
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 4]: A good deal .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 6]: Robbery is the matter . '
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 28]: ` There 'll be Murder the matter , too , ' replied the hump-backed man , coolly , ` if you do n't take your hands off .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 7]: Do you hear me ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 16]: I hear you , ' said the doctor , giving his captive a hearty shake .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 20]: ` Where 's -- confound the fellow , what 's his rascally name -- Sikes ; that 's it .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 8]: Where 's Sikes , you thief ? '
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 41]: The hump-backed man stared , as if in excess of amazement and indignation ; then , twisting himself , dexterously , from the doctor 's grasp , growled forth a volley of horrid oaths , and retired into the house .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 23]: Before he could shut the door , however , the doctor had passed into the parlour , without a word of parley .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 34]: He looked anxiously round ; not an article of furniture ; not a vestige of anything , animate or inanimate ; not even the position of the cupboards ; answered Oliver 's description !
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 4]: ` Now ! '
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 27]: said the hump-backed man , who had watched him keenly , ` what do you mean by coming into my house , in this violent way ?
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 12]: Do you want to rob me , or to murder me ?
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 5]: Which is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 26]: ` Did you ever know a man come out to do either , in a chariot and a pair , you ridiculous old vampire ? '
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 5]: said the irritable doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 9]: ` What do you want , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 4]: demanded the hunchback .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 14]: ` Will you take yourself off , before I do you a mischief ?
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 4]: Curse you ! '
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 37]: ` As soon as I think proper , ' said Mr. Losberne , looking into the other parlour ; which , like the first , bore no resemblance whatever to Oliver 's account of it . '
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 13]: I shall find you out , some day , my friend . '
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 5]: ` Will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 5]: sneered the ill-favoured cripple .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 11]: ` If you ever want me , I 'm here .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 20]: I have n't lived here mad and all alone , for five-and-twenty years , to be scared by you .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 13]: You shall pay for this ; you shall pay for this . '
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 25]: And so saying , the mis-shapen little demon set up a yell , and danced upon the ground , as if wild with rage .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 22]: ` Stupid enough , this , ' muttered the doctor to himself ; ` the boy must have made a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 2]: Here !
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 13]: Put that in your pocket , and shut yourself up again . '
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 18]: With these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money , and returned to the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 73]: The man followed to the chariot door , uttering the wildest imprecations and curses all the way ; but as Mr. Losberne turned to speak to the driver , he looked into the carriage , and eyed Oliver for an instant with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and vindictive , that , waking or sleeping , he could not forget it for months afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 56]: He continued to utter the most fearful imprecations , until the driver had resumed his seat ; and when they were once more on their way , they could see him some distance behind : beating his feet upon the ground , and tearing his hair , in transports of real or pretended rage . '
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 6]: I am an ass ! '
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 9]: said the doctor , after a long silence .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 10]: ` Did you know that before , Oliver ? '
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 6]: ` No , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 10]: ` Then do n't forget it another time . '
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 18]: ` An ass , ' said the doctor again , after a further silence of some minutes .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 26]: ` Even if it had been the right place , and the right fellows had been there , what could I have done , single-handed ?
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 40]: And if I had had assistance , I see no good that I should have done , except leading to my own exposure , and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which I have hushed up this business .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 9]: That would have served me right , though .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 16]: I am always involving myself in some scrape or other , by acting on impulse .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 8]: It might have done me good . '
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 63]: Now , the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon anything but impulse all through his life , and if was no bad compliment to the nature of the impulses which governed him , that so far from being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes , he had the warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 47]: If the truth must be told , he was a little out of temper , for a minute or two , at being disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of Oliver 's story on the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 59]: He soon came round again , however ; and finding that Oliver 's replies to his questions , were still as straightforward and consistent , and still delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth , as they had ever been , he made up his mind to attach full credence to them , from that time forth .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 22]: As Oliver knew the name of the street in which Mr. Brownlow resided , they were enabled to drive straight thither .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 21]: When the coach turned into it , his heart beat so violently , that he could scarcely draw his breath .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 12]: ` Now , my boy , which house is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 4]: inquired Mr. Losberne .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 3]: ` That !
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 3]: That ! '
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 10]: replied Oliver , pointing eagerly out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 5]: ` The white house .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 3]: make haste !
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 4]: Pray make haste !
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 15]: I feel as if I should die : it makes me tremble so . '
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 6]: ` Come , come ! '
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 11]: said the good doctor , patting him on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 20]: ` You will see them directly , and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and well . '
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 5]: I hope so ! '
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 3]: cried Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 17]: ` They were so good to me ; so very , very good to me . '
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 5]: The coach rolled on .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 3]: It stopped .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 12]: No ; that was the wrong house ; the next door .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 11]: It went on a few paces , and stopped again .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 17]: Oliver looked up at the windows , with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 15]: the white house was empty , and there was a bill in the window .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 5]: ` To Let . '
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 19]: ` Knock at the next door , ' cried Mr. Losberne , taking Oliver 's arm in his .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 22]: ` What has become of Mr. Brownlow , who used to live in the adjoining house , do you know ? '
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 12]: The servant did not know ; but would go and inquire .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 27]: She presently returned , and said , that Mr. Brownlow had sold off his goods , and gone to the West Indies , six weeks before .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 10]: Oliver clasped his hands , and sank feebly backward .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 8]: ` Has his housekeeper gone too ? '
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 10]: inquired Mr. Losberne , after a moment 's pause .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 10]: ` Yes , sir ' ; replied the servant .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 24]: ` The old gentleman , the housekeeper , and a gentleman who was a friend of Mr. Brownlow 's , all went together .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 35]: ` Then turn towards home again , ' said Mr. Losberne to the driver ; ` and do n't stop to bait the horses , till you get out of this confounded London ! '
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 8]: ` The book-stall keeper , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 4]: said Oliver . '
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 6]: I know the way there .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 7]: See him , pray , sir !
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 5]: Do see him ! '
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 18]: ` My poor boy , this is disappointment enough for one day , ' said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 8]: ` Quite enough for both of us .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 30]: If we go to the book-stall keeper 's , we shall certainly find that he is dead , or has set his house on fire , or run away .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 7]: No ; home again straight ! '
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 13]: And in obedience to the doctor 's impulse , home they went .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 82]: This bitter disappointment caused Oliver much sorrow and grief , even in the midst of his happiness ; for he had pleased himself , many times during his illness , with thinking of all that Mr. Brownlow and Mrs. Bedwin would say to him : and what delight it would be to tell them how many long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had done for him , and in bewailing his cruel separation from them .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 83]: The hope of eventually clearing himself with them , too , and explaining how he had been forced away , had buoyed him up , and sustained him , under many of his recent trials ; and now , the idea that they should have gone so far , and carried with them the belief that the was an impostor and a robber -- a belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying day -- was almost more than he could bear .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 15]: The circumstance occasioned no alteration , however , in the behaviour of his benefactors .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 42]: After another fortnight , when the fine warm weather had fairly begun , and every tree and flower was putting forth its young leaves and rich blossoms , they made preparations for quitting the house at Chertsey , for some months .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 47]: Sending the plate , which had so excited Fagin 's cupidity , to the banker 's ; and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the house , they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country , and took Oliver with them .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 39]: Who can describe the pleasure and delight , the peace of mind and soft tranquillity , the sickly boy felt in the balmy air , and among the green hills and rich woods , of an inland village !
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 34]: Who can tell how scenes of peace and quietude sink into the minds of pain-worn dwellers in close and noisy places , and carry their own freshness , deep into their jaded hearts !
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 109]: Men who have lived in crowded , pent-up streets , through lives of toil , and who have never wished for change ; men , to whom custom has indeed been second nature , and who have come almost to love each brick and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks ; even they , with the hand of death upon them , have been known to yearn at last for one short glimpse of Nature 's face ; and , carried far from the scenes of their old pains and pleasures , have seemed to pass at once into a new state of being .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 87]: Crawling forth , from day to day , to some green sunny spot , they have had such memories wakened up within them by the sight of the sky , and hill and plain , and glistening water , that a foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline , and they have sunk into their tombs , as peacefully as the sun whose setting they watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before , faded from their dim and feeble sight !
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 22]: The memories which peaceful country scenes call up , are not of this world , nor of its thoughts and hopes .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 88]: Their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved : may purify our thoughts , and bear down before it old enmity and hatred ; but beneath all this , there lingers , in the least reflective mind , a vague and half-formed consciousness of having held such feelings long before , in some remote and distant time , which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come , and bends down pride and worldliness beneath it .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 10]: It was a lovely spot to which they repaired .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 29]: Oliver , whose days had been spent among squalid crowds , and in the midst of noise and brawling , seemed to enter on a new existence there .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 30]: The rose and honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls ; the ivy crept round the trunks of the trees ; and the garden-flowers perfumed the air with delicious odours .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 41]: Hard by , was a little churchyard ; not crowded with tall unsightly gravestones , but full of humble mounds , covered with fresh turf and moss : beneath which , the old people of the village lay at rest .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 65]: Oliver often wandered here ; and , thinking of the wretched grave in which his mother lay , would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen ; but , when he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead , he would cease to think of her as lying in the ground , and would weep for her , sadly , but without pain .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 6]: It was a happy time .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 37]: The days were peaceful and serene ; the nights brought with them neither fear nor care ; no languishing in a wretched prison , or associating with wretched men ; nothing but pleasant and happy thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 49]: Every morning he went to a white-headed old gentleman , who lived near the little church : who taught him to read better , and to write : and who spoke so kindly , and took such pains , that Oliver could never try enough to please him .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 53]: Then , he would walk with Mrs. Maylie and Rose , and hear them talk of books ; or perhaps sit near them , in some shady place , and listen whilst the young lady read : which he could have done , until it grew too dark to see the letters .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 96]: Then , he had his own lesson for the next day to prepare ; and at this , he would work hard , in a little room which looked into the garden , till evening came slowly on , when the ladies would walk out again , and he with them : listening with such pleasure to all they said : and so happy if they wanted a flower that he could climb to reach , or had forgotten anything he could run to fetch : that he could never be quick enought about it .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 48]: When it became quite dark , and they returned home , the young lady would sit down to the piano , and play some pleasant air , or sing , in a low and gentle voice , some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 33]: There would be no candles lighted at such times as these ; and Oliver would sit by one of the windows , listening to the sweet music , in a perfect rapture .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 24]: And when Sunday came , how differently the day was spent , from any way in which he had ever spent it yet !
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 16]: and how happily too ; like all the other days in that most happy time !
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 44]: There was the little church , in the morning , with the green leaves fluttering at the windows : the birds singing without : and the sweet-smelling air stealing in at the low porch , and filling the homely building with its fragrance .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 66]: The poor people were so neat and clean , and knelt so reverently in prayer , that it seemed a pleasure , not a tedious duty , their assembling there together ; and though the singing might be rude , it was real , and sounded more musical -LRB- to Oliver 's ears at least -RRB- than any he had ever heard in church before .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 67]: Then , there were the walks as usual , and many calls at the clean houses of the labouring men ; and at night , Oliver read a chapter or two from the Bible , which he had been studying all the week , and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and pleased , than if he had been the clergyman himself .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 63]: In the morning , Oliver would be a-foot by six o'clock , roaming the fields , and plundering the hedges , far and wide , for nosegays of wild flowers , with which he would return laden , home ; and which it took great care and consideration to arrange , to the best advantage , for the embellishment of the breakfast-table .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 43]: There was fresh groundsel , too , for Miss Maylie 's birds , with which Oliver , who had been studying the subject under the able tuition of the village clerk , would decorate the cages , in the most approved taste .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 115]: When the birds were made all spruce and smart for the day , there was usually some little commission of charity to execute in the village ; or , failing that , there was rare cricket-playing , sometimes , on the green ; or , failing that , there was always something to do in the garden , or about the plants , to which Oliver -LRB- who had studied this science also , under the same master , who was a gardener by trade , -RRB- applied himself with hearty good-will , until Miss Rose made her appearance : when there were a thousand commendations to be bestowed on all he had done .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 38]: So three months glided away ; three months which , in the life of the most blessed and favoured of mortals , might have been unmingled happiness , and which , in Oliver 's were true felicity .
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 76]: With the purest and most amiable generousity on one side ; and the truest , warmest , soul-felt gratitude on the other ; it is no wonder that , by the end of that short time , Oliver Twist had become completely domesticated with the old lady and her niece , and that the fervent attachment of his young and sensitive heart , was repaid by their pride in , and attachment to , himself .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 24]: CHAPTER XXXIII WHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS FRIENDS , EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN CHECK Spring flew swiftly by , and summer came .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 21]: If the village had been beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its richness .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 69]: The great trees , which had looked shrunken and bare in the earlier months , had now burst into strong life and health ; and stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground , converted open and naked spots into choice nooks , where was a deep and pleasant shade from which to look upon the wide prospect , steeped in sunshine , which lay stretched beyond .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 17]: The earth had donned her mantle of brightest green ; and shed her richest perfumes abroad .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 17]: It was the prime and vigour of the year ; all things were glad and flourishing .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 23]: Still , the same quiet life went on at the little cottage , and the same cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 26]: Oliver had long since grown stout and healthy ; but health or sickness made no difference in his warm feelings of a great many people .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 42]: He was still the same gentle , attached , affectionate creature that he had been when pain and suffering had wasted his strength , and when he was dependent for every slight attention , and comfort on those who tended him .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 45]: One beautiful night , when they had taken a longer walk than was customary with them : for the day had been unusually warm , and there was a brilliant moon , and a light wind had sprung up , which was unusually refreshing .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 28]: Rose had been in high spirits , too , and they had walked on , in merry conversation , until they had far exceeded their ordinary bounds .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 11]: Mrs. Maylie being fatigued , they returned more slowly home .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 18]: The young lady merely throwing off her simple bonnet , sat down to the piano as usual .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 37]: After running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes , she fell into a low and very solemn air ; and as she played it , they heard a sound as if she were weeping .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 7]: ` Rose , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 5]: said the elder lady .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 23]: Rose made no reply , but played a little quicker , as though the words had roused her from some painful thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 7]: ` Rose , my love ! '
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 12]: cried Mrs. Maylie , rising hastily , and bending over her .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 5]: ` What is this ?
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 3]: In tears !
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 9]: My dear child , what distresses you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 14]: ` Nothing , aunt ; nothing , ' replied the young lady . '
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 27]: I do n't know what it is ; I ca n't describe it ; but I feel -- ' ` Not ill , my love ? '
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 4]: interposed Mrs. Maylie .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 5]: ` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 6]: Oh , not ill ! '
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 25]: replied Rose : shuddering as though some deadly chillness were passing over her , while she spoke ; ' I shall be better presently .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 7]: Close the window , pray ! '
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 8]: Oliver hastened to comply with her request .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 28]: The young lady , making an effort to recover her cheerfulness , strove to play some livelier tune ; but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 27]: Covering her face with her hands , she sank upon a sofa , and gave vent to the tears which she was now unable to repress .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 5]: ` My child ! '
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 21]: said the elderly lady , folding her arms about her , ' I never saw you so before . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 30]: I would not alarm you if I could avoid it , ' rejoined Rose ; ` but indeed I have tried very hard , and can not help this .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 9]: I fear I AM ill , aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 40]: She was , indeed ; for , when candles were brought , they saw that in the very short time which had elapsed since their return home , the hue of her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 33]: Its expression had lost nothing of its beauty ; but it was changed ; and there was an anxious haggard look about the gentle face , which it had never worn before .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 23]: Another minute , and it was suffused with a crimson flush : and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 21]: Again this disappeared , like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud ; and she was once more deadly pale .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 94]: Oliver , who watched the old lady anxiously , observed that she was alarmed by these appearances ; and so in truth , was he ; but seeing that she affected to make light of them , he endeavoured to do the same , and they so far succeeded , that when Rose was persuaded by her aunt to retire for the night , she was in better spirits ; and appeared even in better health : assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in the morning , quite well . '
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 19]: I hope , ' said Oliver , when Mrs. Maylie returned , ` that nothing is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 38]: She do n't look well to-night , but -- ' The old lady motioned to him not to speak ; and sitting herself down in a dark corner of the room , remained silent for some time .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 18]: At length , she said , in a trembling voice : ' I hope not , Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 16]: I have been very happy with her for some years : too happy , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 21]: It may be time that I should meet with some misfortune ; but I hope it is not this . '
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 4]: ` What ? '
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 3]: inquired Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 28]: ` The heavy blow , ' said the old lady , ` of losing the dear girl who has so long been my comfort and happiness . '
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 4]: God forbid ! '
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 5]: exclaimed Oliver , hastily .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 9]: ` Amen to that , my child ! '
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 9]: said the old lady , wringing her hands .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 12]: ` Surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful ? '
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 3]: said Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 11]: ` Two hours ago , she was quite well . '
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 22]: ` She is very ill now , ' rejoined Mrs. Maylies ; ` and will be worse , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 6]: My dear , dear Rose !
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 10]: Oh , what shall I do without her ! '
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 46]: She gave way to such great grief , that Oliver , suppressing his own emotion , ventured to remonstrate with her ; and to beg , earnestly , that , for the sake of the dear young lady herself , she would be more calm .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 27]: ` And consider , ma'am , ' said Oliver , as the tears forced themselves into his eyes , despite of his efforts to the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 20]: consider how young and good she is , and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all about her .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 42]: I am sure -- certain -- quite certain -- that , for your sake , who are so good yourself ; and for her own ; and for the sake of all she makes so happy ; she will not die .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 10]: Heaven will never let her die so young . '
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 12]: said Mrs. Maylie , laying her hand on Oliver 's head .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 10]: ` You think like a child , poor boy .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 9]: But you teach me my duty , notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 44]: I had forgotten it for a moment , Oliver , but I hope I may be pardoned , for I am old , and have seen enough of illness and death to know the agony of separation from the objects of our love .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 68]: I have seen enough , too , to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared to those that love them ; but this should give us comfort in our sorrow ; for Heaven is just ; and such things teach us , impressively , that there is a brighter world than this ; and that the passage to it is speedy .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 6]: God 's will be done !
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 11]: I love her ; and He know how well ! '
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 36]: Oliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words , she checked her lamentations as though by one effort ; and drawing herself up as she spoke , became composed and firm .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 54]: He was still more astonished to find that this firmness lasted ; and that , under all the care and watching which ensued , Mrs. Maylie was every ready and collected : performing all the duties which had devolved upon her , steadily , and , to all external appearances , even cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 20]: But he was young , and did not know what strong minds are capable of , under trying circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 12]: How should he , when their possessors so seldom know themselves ?
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 5]: An anxious night ensued .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 14]: When morning came , Mrs. Maylie 's predictions were but too well verified .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 13]: Rose was in the first stage of a high and dangerous fever .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 52]: ` We must be active , Oliver , and not give way to useless grief , ' said Mrs. Maylie , laying her finger on her lip , as she looked steadily into his face ; ` this letter must be sent , with all possible expedition , to Mr. Losberne .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 38]: It must be carried to the market-town : which is not more than four miles off , by the footpath across the field : and thence dispatched , by an express on horseback , straight to Chertsey .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 26]: The people at the inn will undertake to do this : and I can trust to you to see it done , I know . '
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 16]: Oliver could make no reply , but looked his anxiety to be gone at once .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 37]: ` Here is another letter , ' said Mrs. Maylie , pausing to reflect ; ` but whether to send it now , or wait until I see how Rose goes on , I scarcely know .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 13]: I would not forward it , unless I feared the worst . '
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 11]: ` Is it for Chertsey , too , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 19]: inquired Oliver ; impatient to execute his commission , and holding out his trembling hand for the letter .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 15]: ` No , ' replied the old lady , giving it to him mechanically .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 35]: Oliver glanced at it , and saw that it was directed to Harry Maylie , Esquire , at some great lord 's house in the country ; where , he could not make out .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 8]: ` Shall it go , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 9]: asked Oliver , looking up , impatiently . '
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 14]: I think not , ' replied Mrs. Maylie , taking it back . '
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 7]: I will wait until to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 27]: With these words , she gave Oliver her purse , and he started off , without more delay , at the greatest speed he could muster .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 89]: Swiftly he ran across the fields , and down the little lanes which sometimes divided them : now almost hidden by the high corn on either side , and now emerging on an open field , where the mowers and haymakers were busy at their work : nor did he stop once , save now and then , for a few seconds , to recover breath , until he came , in a great heat , and covered with dust , on the little market-place of the market-town .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 11]: Here he paused , and looked about for the inn .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 46]: There were a white bank , and a red brewery , and a yellow town-hall ; and in one corner there was a large house , with all the wood about it painted green : before which was the sign of ` The George . '
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 13]: To this he hastened , as soon as it caught his eye .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 83]: He spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway ; and who , after hearing what he wanted , referred him to the ostler ; who after hearing all he had to say again , referred him to the landlord ; who was a tall gentleman in a blue neckcloth , a white hat , drab breeches , and boots with tops to match , leaning against a pump by the stable-door , picking his teeth with a silver toothpick .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 54]: This gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out the bill : which took a long time making out : and after it was ready , and paid , a horse had to be saddled , and a man to be dressed , which took up ten good minutes more .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 39]: Meanwhile Oliver was in such a desperate state of impatience and anxiety , that he felt as if he could have jumped upon the horse himself , and galloped away , full tear , to the next stage .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 62]: At length , all was ready ; and the little parcel having been handed up , with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy delivery , the man set spurs to his horse , and rattling over the uneven paving of the market-place , was out of the town , and galloping along the turnpike-road , in a couple of minutes .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 33]: As it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for , and that no time had been lost , Oliver hurried up the inn-yard , with a somewhat lighter heart .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 32]: He was turning out of the gateway when he accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak , who was at that moment coming out of the inn door .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 4]: ` Hah ! '
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 14]: cried the man , fixing his eyes on Oliver , and suddenly recoiling .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 9]: ` What the devil 's this ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 31]: I beg your pardon , sir , ' said Oliver ; ' I was in a great hurry to get home , and did n't see you were coming . '
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 4]: ` Death ! '
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 16]: muttered the man to himself , glaring at the boy with his large dark eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 7]: ` Who would have thought it !
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 5]: Grind him to ashes !
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 17]: He 'd start up from a stone coffin , to come in my way ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 18]: I am sorry , ' stammered Oliver , confused by the strange man 's wild look . '
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 9]: I hope I have not hurt you ! '
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 5]: ` Rot you ! '
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 38]: murmured the man , in a horrible passion ; between his clenched teeth ; ` if I had only had the courage to say the word , I might have been free of you in a night .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 15]: Curses on your head , and black death on your heart , you imp !
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 7]: What are you doing here ? '
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 13]: The man shook his fist , as he uttered these words incoherently .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 32]: He advanced towards Oliver , as if with the intention of aiming a blow at him , but fell violently on the ground : writhing and foaming , in a fit .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 32]: Oliver gazed , for a moment , at the struggles of the madman -LRB- for such he supposed him to be -RRB- ; and then darted into the house for help .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 54]: Having seen him safely carried into the hotel , he turned his face homewards , running as fast as he could , to make up for lost time : and recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear , the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 39]: The circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long , however : for when he reached the cottage , there was enough to occupy his mind , and to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 13]: Rose Maylie had rapidly grown worse ; before mid-night she was delirious .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 44]: A medical practitioner , who resided on the spot , was in constant attendance upon her ; and after first seeing the patient , he had taken Mrs. Maylie aside , and pronounced her disorder to be one of a most alarming nature .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 23]: ` In fact , ' he said , ` it would be little short of a miracle , if she recovered . '
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 33]: How often did Oliver start from his bed that night , and stealing out , with noiseless footstep , to the staircase , listen for the slightest sound from the sick chamber !
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 42]: How often did a tremble shake his frame , and cold drops of terror start upon his brow , when a sudden trampling of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of , had even then occurred !
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 52]: And what had been the fervency of all the prayers he had ever muttered , compared with those he poured forth , now , in the agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the gentle creature , who was tottering on the deep grave 's verge !
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 28]: the suspense , the fearful , acute suspense , of standing idly by while the life of one we dearly love , is trembling in the balance !
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 100]: the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind , and make the heart beat violently , and the breath come thick , by the force of the images they conjure up before it ; the DESPERATE ANXIETY TO BE DOING SOMETHING to relieve the pain , or lessen the danger , which we have no power to alleviate ; the sinking of soul and spirit , which the sad remembrance of our helplessness produces ; what tortures can equal these ; what reflections or endeavours can , in the full tide and fever of the time , allay them !
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 12]: Morning came ; and the little cottage was lonely and still .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 25]: People spoke in whispers ; anxious faces appeared at the gate , from time to time ; women and children went away in tears .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 49]: All the livelong day , and for hours after it had grown dark , Oliver paced softly up and down the garden , raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber , and shuddering to see the darkened window , looking as if death lay stretched inside .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 8]: Late that night , Mr. Losberne arrived .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 33]: ` It is hard , ' said the good doctor , turning away as he spoke ; ` so young ; so much beloved ; but there is very little hope . '
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 3]: Another morning .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 58]: The sun shone brightly ; as brightly as if it looked upon no misery or care ; and , with every leaf and flower in full bloom about her ; with life , and health , and sounds and sights of joy , surrounding her on every side : the fair young creature lay , wasting fast .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 27]: Oliver crept away to the old churchyard , and sitting down on one of the green mounds , wept and prayed for her , in silence .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 115]: There was such peace and beauty in the scene ; so much of brightness and mirth in the sunny landscape ; such blithesome music in the songs of the summer birds ; such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook , careering overhead ; so much of life and joyousness in all ; that , when the boy raised his aching eyes , and looked about , the thought instinctively occurred to him , that this was not a time for death ; that Rose could surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay ; that graves were for cold and cheerless winter : not for sunlight and fragrance .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 27]: He almost thought that shrouds were for the old and shrunken ; and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in their ghastly folds .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 13]: A knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 2]: Another !
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 2]: Again !
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 8]: It was tolling for the funeral service .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 19]: A group of humble mourners entered the gate : wearing white favours ; for the corpse was young .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 22]: They stood uncovered by a grave ; and there was a mother -- a mother once -- among the weeping train .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 12]: But the sun shone brightly , and the birds sang on .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 40]: Oliver turned homeward , thinking on the many kindnesses he had received from the young lady , and wishing that the time could come again , that he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 58]: He had no cause for self-reproach on the score of neglect , or want of thought , for he had been devoted to her service ; and yet a hundred little occasions rose up before him , on which he fancied he might have been more zealous , and more earnest , and wished he had been .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 50]: We need be careful how we deal with those about us , when every death carries to some small circle of survivors , thoughts of so much omitted , and so little done -- of so many things forgotten , and so many more which might have been repaired !
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 28]: There is no remorse so deep as that which is unavailing ; if we would be spared its tortures , let us remember this , in time .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 13]: When he reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little parlour .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 33]: Oliver 's heart sand at sight of her ; for she had never left the bedside of her niece ; and he trembled to think what change could have driven her away .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 32]: He learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep , from which she would waken , either to recovery and life , or to bid them farewell , and die .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 13]: They sat , listening , and afraid to speak , for hours .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 45]: The untasted meal was removed , with looks which showed that their thoughts were elsewhere , they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower , and , at length , cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his departure .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 11]: Their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching footstep .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 13]: They both involuntarily darted to the door , as Mr. Losberne entered .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 6]: ` What of Rose ? '
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 5]: cried the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 6]: ` Tell me at once !
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 9]: I can bear it ; anything but suspense !
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 4]: , tell me !
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 7]: in the name of Heaven ! '
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 13]: ` You must compose yourself , ' said the doctor supporting her .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 11]: ` Be calm , my dear ma'am , pray . '
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 10]: ` Let me go , in God 's name !
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 4]: My dear child !
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 4]: She is dead !
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 5]: She is dying ! '
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 6]: cried the doctor , passionately .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 22]: ` As He is good and merciful , she will live to bless us all , for years to come . '
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 48]: The lady fell upon her knees , and tried to fold her hands together ; but the energy which had supported her so long , fled up to Heaven with her first thanksgiving ; and she sank into the friendly arms which were extended to receive her .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 35]: CHAPTER XXIV CONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE ; AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO OLIVER It was almost too much happiness to bear .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 21]: Oliver felt stunned and stupefied by the unexpected intelligence ; he could not weep , or speak , or rest .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 70]: He had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed , until , after a long ramble in the quiet evening air , a burst of tears came to his relief , and he seemed to awaken , all at once , to a full sense of the joyful change that had occurred , and the almost insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 32]: The night was fast closing in , when he returned homeward : laden with flowers which he had culled , with peculiar care , for the adornment of the sick chamber .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 25]: As he walked briskly along the road , he heard behind him , the noise of some vehicle , approaching at a furious pace .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 42]: Looking round , he saw that it was a post-chaise , driven at great speed ; and as the horses were galloping , and the road was narrow , he stood leaning against a gate until it should have passed him .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 38]: As it dashed on , Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nitecap , whose face seemed familiar to him , although his view was so brief that he could not identify the person .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 40]: In another second or two , the nightcap was thrust out of the chaise-window , and a stentorian voice bellowed to the driver to stop : which he did , as soon as he could pull up his horses .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 18]: Then , the nightcap once again appeared : and the same voice called Oliver by his name .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 4]: ` Here ! '
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 4]: cried the voice .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 8]: ` Oliver , what 's the news ?
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 3]: Miss Rose !
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 4]: Master O-li-ver ! '
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 8]: ` Is is you , Giles ? '
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 9]: cried Oliver , running up to the chaise-door .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 41]: Giles popped out his nightcap again , preparatory to making some reply , when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the other corner of the chaise , and who eagerly demanded what was the news .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 6]: ` In a word ! '
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 10]: cried the gentleman , ` Better or worse ? '
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 7]: ` Better -- much better ! '
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 5]: replied Oliver , hastily .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 5]: ` Thank Heaven ! '
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 4]: exclaimed the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 6]: ` You are sure ? '
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 9]: ` Quite , sir , ' replied Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 25]: ` The change took place only a few hours ago ; and Mr. Losberne says , that all danger is at an end . '
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 28]: The gentleman said not another word , but , opening the chaise-door , leaped out , and taking Oliver hurriedly by the arm , led him aside .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 6]: ` You are quite certain ?
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 18]: There is no possibility of any mistake on your part , my boy , is there ? '
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 8]: demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 18]: ` Do not deceive me , by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 13]: I would not for the world , sir , ' replied Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 7]: ` Indeed you may believe me .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 20]: Mr. Losberne 's words were , that she would live to bless us all for many years to come .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 7]: I heard him say so . '
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 37]: The tears stood in Oliver 's eyes as he recalled the scene which was the beginning of so much happiness ; and the gentleman turned his face away , and remained silent , for some minutes .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 45]: Oliver thought he heard him sob , more than once ; but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh remark -- for he could well guess what his feelings were -- and so stood apart , feigning to be occupied with his nosegay .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 44]: All this time , Mr. Giles , with the white nightcap on , had been sitting on the steps of the chaise , supporting an elbow on each knee , and wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief dotted with white spots .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 35]: That the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion , was abundently demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the young gentleman , when he turned round and addressed him . '
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 22]: I think you had better go on to my mother 's in the chaise , Giles , ' said he . '
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 19]: I would rather walk slowly on , so as to gain a little time before I see her .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 9]: You can say I am coming . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 45]: I beg your pardon , Mr. Harry , ' said Giles : giving a final polish to his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief ; ` but if you would leave the postboy to say that , I should be very much obliged to you .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 31]: It would n't be proper for the maids to see me in this state , sir ; I should never have any more authority with them if they did . '
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 18]: ` Well , ' rejoined Harry Maylie , smiling , ` you can do as you like .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 20]: Let him go on with the luggage , if you wish it , and do you follow with us .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 20]: Only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering , or we shall be taken for madmen . '
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 35]: Mr. Giles , reminded of his unbecoming costume , snatched off and pocketed his nightcap ; and substituted a hat , of grave and sober shape , which he took out of the chaise .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 21]: This done , the postboy drove off ; Giles , Mr. Maylie , and Oliver , followed at their leisure .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 21]: As they walked along , Oliver glanced from time to time with much interest and curiosity at the new comer .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 29]: He seemed about five-and-twenty years of age , and was of the middle height ; his countenance was frank and handsome ; and his demeanor easy and prepossessing .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 44]: Notwithstanding the difference between youth and age , he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady , that Oliver would have had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship , if he had not already spoken of her as his mother .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 15]: Mrs. Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 13]: The meeting did not take place without great emotion on both sides .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 4]: ` Mother ! '
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 15]: whispered the young man ; ` why did you not write before ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 31]: I did , ' replied Mrs. Maylie ; ` but , on reflection , I determined to keep back the letter until I had heard Mr. Losberne 's opinion . '
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 23]: ` But why , ' said the young man , ` why run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened ?
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 27]: If Rose had -- I can not utter that word now -- if this illness had terminated differently , how could you ever have forgiven yourself !
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 10]: How could I ever have know happiness again ! '
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 51]: ` If that HAD been the case , Harry , ' said Mrs. Maylie , ' I fear your happiness would have been effectually blighted , and that your arrival here , a day sooner or a day later , would have been of very , very little import . '
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 13]: ` And who can wonder if it be so , mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 14]: rejoined the young man ; ` or why should I say , IF ?
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 20]: -- It is -- it is -- you know it , mother -- you must know it ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 47]: I know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can offer , ' said Mrs. Maylie ; ' I know that the devotion and affection of her nature require no ordinary return , but one that shall be deep and lasting .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 64]: If I did not feel this , and know , besides , that a changed behaviour in one she loved would break her heart , I should not feel my task so difficult of performance , or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom , when I take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty . '
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 11]: ` This is unkind , mother , ' said Harry .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 27]: ` Do you still suppose that I am a boy ignorant of my own mind , and mistaking the impulses of my own soul ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 49]: I think , my dear son , ' returned Mrs. Maylie , laying her hand upon his shoulder , ` that youth has many generous impulses which do not last ; and that among them are some , which , being gratified , become only the more fleeting .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 120]: Above all , I think ' said the lady , fixing her eyes on her son 's face , ` that if an enthusiastic , ardent , and ambitious man marry a wife on whose name there is a stain , which , though it originate in no fault of hers , may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her , and upon his children also : and , in exact proportion to his success in the world , be cast in his teeth , and made the subject of sneers against him : he may , no matter how generous and good his nature , one day repent of the connection he formed in early life .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 14]: And she may have the pain of knowing that he does so . '
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 38]: ` Mother , ' said the young man , impatiently , ` he would be a selfish brute , unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe , who acted thus . '
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 13]: ` You think so now , Harry , ' replied his mother .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 6]: ` And ever will ! '
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 5]: said the young man .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 44]: ` The mental agony I have suffered , during the last two days , wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion which , as you well know , is not one of yesterday , nor one I have lightly formed .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 8]: On Rose , sweet , gentle girl !
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 17]: my heart is set , as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 43]: I have no thought , no view , no hope in life , beyond her ; and if you oppose me in this great stake , you take my peace and happiness in your hands , and cast them to the wind .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 27]: Mother , think better of this , and of me , and do not disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little . '
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 31]: ` Harry , ' said Mrs. Maylie , ` it is because I think so much of warm and sensitive hearts , that I would spare them from being wounded .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 19]: But we have said enough , and more than enough , on this matter , just now . '
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 13]: ` Let it rest with Rose , then , ' interposed Harry .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 25]: ` You will not press these overstrained opinions of yours , so far , as to throw any obstacle in my way ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 24]: I will not , ' rejoined Mrs. Maylie ; ` but I would have you consider -- ' ' I HAVE considered ! '
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 16]: was the impatient reply ; ` Mother , I have considered , years and years .
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 14]: I have considered , ever since I have been capable of serious reflection .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 34]: My feelings remain unchanged , as they ever will ; and why should I suffer the pain of a delay in giving them vent , which can be productive of no earthly good ?
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 12]: Before I leave this place , Rose shall hear me . '
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 9]: ` She shall , ' said Mrs. Maylie .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 27]: ` There is something in your manner , which would almost imply that she will hear me coldly , mother , ' said the young man .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 16]: ` Not coldly , ' rejoined the old lady ; ` far from it . '
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 5]: ` How then ? '
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 5]: urged the young man .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 9]: ` She has formed no other attachment ? '
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 27]: ` No , indeed , ' replied his mother ; ` you have , or I mistake , too strong a hold on her affections already .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 25]: What I would say , ' resumed the old lady , stopping her son as he was about to speak , ` is this .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 94]: Before you stake your all on this chance ; before you suffer yourself to be carried to the highest point of hope ; reflect for a few moments , my dear child , on Rose 's history , and consider what effect the knowledge of her doubtful birth may have on her decision : devoted as she is to us , with all the intensity of her noble mind , and with that perfect sacrifice of self which , in all matters , great or trifling , has always been her characteristic . '
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 14]: ` That I leave you to discover , ' replied Mrs. Maylie . '
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 7]: I must go back to her .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 6]: God bless you ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 8]: I shall see you again to-night ? '
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 7]: said the young man , eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 17]: ` By and by , ' replied the lady ; ` when I leave Rose . '
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 10]: ` You will tell her I am here ? '
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 3]: said Harry .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 9]: ` Of course , ' replied Mrs. Maylie .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 24]: ` And say how anxious I have been , and how much I have suffered , and how I long to see her .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 11]: You will not refuse to do this , mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 17]: ` No , ' said the old lady ; ' I will tell her all . '
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 15]: And pressing her son 's hand , affectionately , she hastened from the room .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 19]: Mr. Losberne and Oliver had remained at another end of the apartment while this hurried conversation was proceeding .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 19]: The former now held out his hand to Harry Maylie ; and hearty salutations were exchanged between them .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 68]: The doctor then communicated , in reply to multifarious questions from his young friend , a precise account of his patient 's situation ; which was quite as consolatory and full of promise , as Oliver 's statement had encouraged him to hope ; and to the whole of which , Mr. Giles , who affected to be busy about the luggage , listened with greedy ears .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 12]: ` Have you shot anything particular , lately , Giles ? '
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 9]: inquired the doctor , when he had concluded .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 17]: ` Nothing particular , sir , ' replied Mr. Giles , colouring up to the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 12]: ` Nor catching any thieves , nor identifying any house-breakers ? '
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 4]: said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 16]: ` None at all , sir , ' replied Mr. Giles , with much gravity .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 25]: ` Well , ' said the doctor , ' I am sorry to hear it , because you do that sort of thing admirably .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 7]: Pray , how is Brittles ? '
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 31]: ` The boy is very well , sir , ' said Mr. Giles , recovering his usual tone of patronage ; ` and sends his respectful duty , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 10]: ` That 's well , ' said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 44]: ` Seeing you here , reminds me , Mr. Giles , that on the day before that on which I was called away so hurriedly , I executed , at the request of your good mistress , a small commission in your favour .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 12]: Just step into this corner a moment , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 47]: Mr. Giles walked into the corner with much importance , and some wonder , and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor , on the termination of which , he made a great many bows , and retired with steps of unusual stateliness .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 93]: The subject matter of this conference was not disclosed in the parlour , but the kitchen was speedily enlightened concerning it ; for Mr. Giles walked straight thither , and having called for a mug of ale , announced , with an air of majesty , which was highly effective , that it had pleased his mistress , in consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery , to depost , in the local savings-bank , the sum of five-and-twenty pounds , for his sole use and benefit .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 56]: At this , the two women-servants lifted up their hands and eyes , and supposed that Mr. Giles , pulling out his shirt-frill , replied , ` No , no ' ; and that if they observed that he was at all haughty to his inferiors , he would thank them to tell him so .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 49]: And then he made a great many other remarks , no less illustrative of his humility , which were received with equal favour and applause , and were , withal , as original and as much to the purpose , as the remarks of great men commonly are .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 114]: Above stairs , the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away ; for the doctor was in high spirits ; and however fatigued or thoughtful Harry Maylie might have been at first , he was not proof against the worthy gentleman 's good humour , which displayed itself in a great variety of sallies and professional recollections , and an abundance of small jokes , which struck Oliver as being the drollest things he had ever heard , and caused him to laugh proportionately ; to the evident satisfaction of the doctor , who laughed immoderately at himself , and made Harry laugh almost as heartily , by the very force of sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 57]: So , they were as pleasant a party as , under the circumstances , they could well have been ; and it was late before they retired , with light and thankful hearts , to take that rest of which , after the doubt and suspense they had recently undergone , they stood much in need .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 29]: Oliver rose next morning , in better heart , and went about his usual occupations , with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many days .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 37]: The birds were once more hung out , to sing , in their old places ; and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found , were once more gathered to gladden Rose with their beauty .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 34]: The melancholy which had seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang , for days past , over every object , beautiful as all were , was dispelled by magic .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 34]: The dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves ; the air to rustle among them with a sweeter music ; and the sky itself to look more blue and bright .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 22]: Such is the influence which the condition of our own thoughts , exercise , even over the appearance of external objects .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 38]: Men who look on nature , and their fellow-men , and cry that all is dark and gloomy , are in the right ; but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 12]: The real hues are delicate , and need a clearer vision .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 28]: It is worthy of remark , and Oliver did not fail to note it at the time , that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 42]: Harry Maylie , after the very first morning when he met Oliver coming laden home , was seized with such a passion for flowers , and displayed such a taste in their arrangement , as left his young companion far behind .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 36]: If Oliver were behindhand in these respects , he knew where the best were to be found ; and morning after morning they scoured the country together , and brought home the fairest that blossomed .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 59]: The window of the young lady 's chamber was opened now ; for she loved to feel the rich summer air stream in , and revive her with its freshness ; but there always stood in water , just inside the lattice , one particular little bunch , which was made up with great care , every morning .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 66]: Oliver could not help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away , although the little vase was regularly replenished ; nor , could he help observing , that whenever the doctor came into the garden , he invariably cast his eyes up to that particular corner , and nodded his head most expressively , as he set forth on his morning 's walk .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 16]: Pending these observations , the days were flying by ; and Rose was rapidly recovering .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 43]: Nor did Oliver 's time hang heavy on his hands , although the young lady had not yet left her chamber , and there were no evening walks , save now and then , for a short distance , with Mrs. Maylie .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 29]: He applied himself , with redoubled assiduity , to the instructions of the white-headed old gentleman , and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even himself .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 23]: It was while he was engaged in this pursuit , that he was greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurence .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 29]: The little room in which he was accustomed to sit , when busy at his books , was on the ground-floor , at the back of the house .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 34]: It was quite a cottage-room , with a lattice-window : around which were clusters of jessamine and honeysuckle , that crept over the casement , and filled the place with their delicious perfume .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 24]: It looked into a garden , whence a wicket-gate opened into a small paddock ; all beyond , was fine meadow-land and wood .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 20]: There was no other dwelling near , in that direction ; and the prospect it commanded was very extensive .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 29]: One beautiful evening , when the first shades of twilight were beginning to settle upon the earth , Oliver sat at this window , intent upon his books .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 57]: He had been poring over them for some time ; and , as the day had been uncommonly sultry , and he had exerted himself a great deal , it it no disparagement to the authors , whoever they may have been , to say , that gradually and by slow degrees , he fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 43]: There is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes , which , while it holds the body prisoner , does not free the mind from a sense of things about it , and enable it to ramble at its pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 105]: So far as an overpowering heaviness , a prostration of strength , and an utter inability to control our thoughts or power of motion , can be called sleep , this is it ; and yet , we have a consciousness of all that is going on about us , and , if we dream at such a time , words which are really spoken , or sounds which really exist at the moment , accommodate themselves with surprising readiness to our visions , until reality and imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost matter of impossibility to separate the two .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 14]: Nor is this , the most striking phenomenon indcidental to such a state .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 75]: It is an undoubted fact , that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead , yet our sleeping thoughts , and the visionary scenes that pass before us , will be influenced and materially influenced , by the MERE SILENT PRESENCE of some external object ; which may not have been near us when we closed our eyes : and of whose vicinity we have had no waking consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 38]: Oliver knew , perfectly well , that he was in his own little room ; that his books were lying on the table before him ; that the sweet air was stirring among the creeping plants outside .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 6]: And yet he was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 33]: Suddenly , the scene changed ; the air became close and confined ; and he thought , with a glow of terror , that he was in the Jew 's house again .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 32]: There sat the hideous old man , in his accustomed corner , pointing at him , and whispering to another man , with his face averted , who sat beside him .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 7]: ` Hush , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 16]: he thought he heard the Jew say ; ` it is he , sure enough .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 4]: Come away . '
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 4]: ` He ! '
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 16]: the other man seemed to answer ; ` could I mistake him , think you ?
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 33]: If a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape , and he stood amongst them , there is something that would tell me how to point him out .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 37]: If you buried him fifty feet deep , and took me across his grave , I fancy I should know , if there was n't a mark above it , that he lay buried there ? '
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 23]: The man seemed to say this , with such dreadful hatred , that Oliver awoke with the fear , and started up .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 3]: Good Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 26]: what was that , which sent the blood tingling to his heart , and deprived him of his voice , and of power to move !
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 44]: There -- there -- at the window -- close before him -- so close , that he could have almost touched him before he started back : with his eyes peering into the room , and meeting his : there stood the Jew !
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 28]: And beside him , white with rage or fear , or both , were the scowling features of the man who had accosted him in the inn-yard .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 21]: It was but an instant , a glance , a flash , before his eyes ; and they were gone .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 39]: But they had recognised him , and he them ; and their look was as firmly impressed upon his memory , as if it had been deeply carved in stone , and set before him from his birth .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 22]: He stood transfixed for a moment ; then , leaping from the window into the garden , called loudly for help .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 75]: CHAPTER XXXV CONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER 'S ADVENTURE ; AND A CONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSE When the inmates of the house , attracted by Oliver 's cries , hurried to the spot from which they proceeded , they found him , pale and agitated , pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house , and scarcely able to articulate the words , ` The Jew !
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 4]: the Jew ! '
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 39]: Mr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant ; but Harry Maylie , whose perceptions were something quicker , and who had heard Oliver 's history from his mother , understood it at once .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 8]: ` What direction did he take ? '
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 15]: he asked , catching up a heavy stick which was standing in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 25]: ` That , ' replied Oliver , pointing out the course the man had taken ; ' I missed them in an instant . '
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 10]: ` Then , they are in the ditch ! '
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 3]: said Harry .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 3]: ` Follow !
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 11]: And keep as near me , as you can . '
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 30]: So saying , he sprang over the hedge , and darted off with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the others to keep near him .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 85]: Giles followed as well as he could ; and Oliver followed too ; and in the course of a minute or two , Mr. Losberne , who had been out walking , and just then returned , tumbled over the hedge after them , and picking himself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to possess , struck into the same course at no contemptible speed , shouting all the while , most prodigiously , to know what was the matter .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 72]: On they all went ; nor stopped they once to breathe , until the leader , striking off into an angle of the field indicated by Oliver , began to search , narrowly , the ditch and hedge adjoining ; which afforded time for the remainder of the party to come up ; and for Oliver to communicate to Mr. Losberne the circumstances that had led to so vigorous a pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 7]: The search was all in vain .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 14]: There were not even the traces of recent footsteps , to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 25]: They stood now , on the summit of a little hill , commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 53]: There was the village in the hollow on the left ; but , in order to gain that , after pursuing the track Oliver had pointed out , the men must have made a circuit of open ground , which it was impossible they could have accomplished in so short a time .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 23]: A thick wood skirted the meadow-land in another direction ; but they could not have gained that covert for the same reason .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 15]: ` It must have been a dream , Oliver , ' said Harry Maylie .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 33]: ` Oh no , indeed , sir , ' replied Oliver , shuddering at the very recollection of the old wretch 's countenance ; ' I saw him too plainly for that .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 14]: I saw them both , as plainly as I see you now . '
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 7]: ` Who was the other ? '
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 8]: inquired Harry and Mr. Losberne , together .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 24]: ` The very same man I told you of , who came so suddenly upon me at the inn , ' said Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 19]: ` We had our eyes fixed full upon each other ; and I could swear to him . '
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 7]: ` They took this way ? '
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 9]: demanded Harry : ` are you sure ? '
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 34]: ` As I am that the men were at the window , ' replied Oliver , pointing down , as he spoke , to the hedge which divided the cottage-garden from the meadow .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 28]: ` The tall man leaped over , just there ; and the Jew , running a few paces to the right , crept through that gap . '
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 33]: The two gentlemen watched Oliver 's earnest face , as he spoke , and looking from him to each other , seemed to fell satisfied of the accuracy of what he said .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 18]: Still , in no direction were there any appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 21]: The grass was long ; but it was trodden down nowhere , save where their own feet had crushed it .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 45]: The sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay ; but in no one place could they discern the print of men 's shoes , or the slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the ground for hours before .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 6]: ` This is strange ! '
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 3]: said Harry .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 4]: ` Strange ? '
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 4]: echoed the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 14]: ` Blathers and Duff , themselves , could make nothing of it . '
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 36]: Notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search , they did not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further prosecution hopeless ; and even then , they gave it up with reluctance .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 28]: Giles was dispatched to the different ale-houses in the village , furnished with the best description Oliver could give of the appearance and dress of the strangers .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 43]: Of these , the Jew was , at all events , sufficiently remarkable to be remembered , supposing he had been seen drinking , or loitering about ; but Giles returned without any intelligence , calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 21]: On the next day , fresh search was made , and the inquiries renewed ; but with no better success .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 34]: On the day following , Oliver and Mr. Maylie repaired to the market-town , in the hope of seeing or hearing something of the men there ; but this effort was equally fruitless .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 33]: After a few days , the affair began to be forgotten , as most affairs are , when wonder , having no fresh food to support it , dies away of itself .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 7]: Meanwhile , Rose was rapidly recovering .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 28]: She had left her room : was able to go out ; and mixing once more with the family , carried joy into the hearts of all .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 55]: But , although this happy change had a visible effect on the little circle ; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more heard in the cottage ; there was at times , an unwonted restraint upon some there : even upon Rose herself : which Oliver could not fail to remark .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 28]: Mrs. Maylie and her son were often closeted together for a long time ; and more than once Rose appeared with traces of tears upon her face .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 41]: After Mr. Losberne had fixed a day for his departure to Chertsey , these symptoms increased ; and it became evident that something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady , and of somebody else besides .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 36]: At length , one morning , when Rose was alone in the breakfast-parlour , Harry Maylie entered ; and , with some hesitation , begged permission to speak with her for a few moments . '
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 24]: A few -- a very few -- will suffice , Rose , ' said the young man , drawing his chair towards her .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 41]: ` What I shall have to say , has already presented itself to your mind ; the most cherished hopes of my heart are not unknown to you , though from my lips you have not heard them stated . '
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 24]: Rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance ; but that might have been the effect of her recent illness .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 21]: She merely bowed ; and bending over some plants that stood near , waited in silence for him to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 17]: ` I -- I -- ought to have left here , before , ' said Harry .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 10]: ` You should , indeed , ' replied Rose .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 15]: ` Forgive me for saying so , but I wish you had . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 40]: I was brought here , by the most dreadful and agonising of all apprehensions , ' said the young man ; ` the fear of losing the one dear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed .
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 11]: You had been dying ; trembling between earth and heaven .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 38]: We know that when the young , the beautiful , and good , are visited with sickness , their pure spirits insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest ; we know , Heaven help us !
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 16]: that the best and fairest of our kind , too often fade in blooming . '
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 65]: There were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl , as these words were spoken ; and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent , and glistened brightly in its cup , making it more beautiful , it seemed as though the outpouring of her fresh young heart , claimed kindred naturally , with the loveliest things in nature . '
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 34]: A creature , ' continued the young man , passionately , ' a creature as fair and innocent of guile as one of God 's own angels , fluttered between life and death .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 32]: who could hope , when the distant world to which she was akin , half opened to her view , that she would return to the sorrow and calamity of this !
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 106]: Rose , Rose , to know that you were passing away like some soft shadow , which a light from above , casts upon the earth ; to have no hope that you would be spared to those who linger here ; hardly to know a reason why you should be ; to feel that you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and the best have winged their early flight ; and yet to pray , amid all these consolations , that you might be restored to those who loved you -- these were distractions almost too great to bear .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 53]: They were mine , by day and night ; and with them , came such a rushing torrent of fears , and apprehensions , and selfish regrets , lest you should die , and never know how devotedly I loved you , as almost bore down sense and reason in its course .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 3]: You recovered .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 43]: Day by day , and almost hour by hour , some drop of health came back , and mingling with the spent and feeble stream of life which circulated languidly within you , swelled it again to a high and rushing tide .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 24]: I have watched you change almost from death , to life , with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep affection .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 24]: Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this ; for it has softened my heart to all mankind . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 41]: I did not mean that , ' said Rose , weeping ; ' I only wish you had left here , that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again ; to pursuits well worthy of you . '
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 40]: ` There is no pursuit more worthy of me : more worthy of the highest nature that exists : than the struggle to win such a heart as yours , ' said the young man , taking her hand .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 8]: ` Rose , my own dear Rose !
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 88]: For years -- for years -- I have loved you ; hoping to win my way to fame , and then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to share ; thinking , in my daydreams , how I would remind you , in that happy moment , of the many silent tokens I had given of a boy 's attachment , and claim your hand , as in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed between us !
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 45]: That time has not arrived ; but here , with not fame won , and no young vision realised , I offer you the heart so long your own , and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the offer . '
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 11]: ` Your behaviour has ever been kind and noble . '
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 12]: said Rose , mastering the emotions by which she was agitated .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 18]: ` As you believe that I am not insensible or ungrateful , so hear my answer . '
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 19]: ` It is , that I may endeavour to deserve you ; it is , dear Rose ? '
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 41]: ` It is , ' replied Rose , ` that you must endeavour to forget me ; not as your old and dearly-attached companion , for that would wound me deeply ; but , as the object of your love .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 19]: Look into the world ; think how many hearts you would be proud to gain , are there .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 27]: Confide some other passion to me , if you will ; I will be the truest , warmest , and most faithful friend you have . '
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 26]: There was a pause , during which , Rose , who had covered her face with one hand , gave free vent to her tears .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 6]: Harry still retained the other .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 27]: ` And your reasons , Rose , ' he said , at length , in a low voice ; ` your reasons for this decision ? '
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 13]: ` You have a right to know them , ' rejoined Rose .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 10]: ` You can say nothing to alter my resolution .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 9]: It is a duty that I must perform .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 13]: I owe it , alike to others , and to myself . '
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 5]: ` To yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 5]: ` Yes , Harry .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 55]: I owe it to myself , that I , a friendless , portionless , girl , with a blight upon my name , should not give your friends reason to suspect that I had sordidly yielded to your first passion , and fastened myself , a clog , on all your hopes and projects .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 33]: I owe it to you and yours , to prevent you from opposing , in the warmth of your generous nature , this great obstacle to your progress in the world . '
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 15]: ` If your inclinations chime with your sense of duty -- ' Harry began .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 12]: ` They do not , ' replied Rose , colouring deeply .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 8]: ` Then you return my love ? '
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 3]: said Harry .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 22]: ` Say but that , dear Rose ; say but that ; and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment ! '
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 36]: ` If I could have done so , without doing heavy wrong to him I loved , ' rejoined Rose , ' I could have -- ' ` Have received this declaration very differently ? '
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 3]: said Harry .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 15]: ` Do not conceal that from me , at least , Rose . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 7]: I could , ' said Rose .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 4]: ` Stay ! '
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 16]: she added , disengaging her hand , ` why should we prolong this painful interview ?
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 52]: Most painful to me , and yet productive of lasting happiness , notwithstanding ; for it WILL be happiness to know that I once held the high place in your regard which I now occupy , and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me with new fortitude and firmness .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 4]: Farewell , Harry !
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 64]: As we have met to-day , we meet no more ; but in other relations than those in which this conversation have placed us , we may be long and happily entwined ; and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can call down from the source of all truth and sincerity , cheer and prosper you ! '
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 10]: ` Another word , Rose , ' said Harry .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 8]: ` Your reason in your own words .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 11]: From your own lips , let me hear it ! '
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 18]: ` The prospect before you , ' answered Rose , firmly , ` is a brilliant one .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 23]: All the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help men in public life , are in store for you .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 45]: But those connections are proud ; and I will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the mother who gave me life ; nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of her who has so well supplied that mother 's place .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 37]: In a word , ' said the young lady , turning away , as her temporary firmness forsook her , ` there is a stain upon my name , which the world visits on innocent heads .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 21]: I will carry it into no blood but my own ; and the reproach shall rest alone on me . '
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 7]: ` One word more , Rose .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 3]: Dearest Rose !
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 4]: one more ! '
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 8]: cried Harry , throwing himself before her .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 45]: ` If I had been less -- less fortunate , the world would call it -- if some obscure and peaceful life had been my destiny -- if I had been poor , sick , helpless -- would you have turned from me then ?
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 16]: Or has my probable advancement to riches and honour , given this scruple birth ? '
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 12]: ` Do not press me to reply , ' answered Rose .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 11]: ` The question does not arise , and never will .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 12]: It is unfair , almost unkind , to urge it . '
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 38]: ` If your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is , ' retorted Harry , ` it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way , and light the path before me .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 29]: It is not an idle thing to do so much , by the utterance of a few brief words , for one who loves you beyond all else .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 40]: Oh , Rose : in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment ; in the name of all I have suffered for you , and all you doom me to undergo ; answer me this one question ! '
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 72]: ` Then , if your lot had been differently cast , ' rejoined Rose ; ` if you had been even a little , but not so far , above me ; if I could have been a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement , and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds ; I should have been spared this trial .
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 27]: I have every reason to be happy , very happy , now ; but then , Harry , I own I should have been happier . '
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 49]: Busy recollections of old hopes , cherished as a girl , long ago , crowded into the mind of Rose , while making this avowal ; but they brought tears with them , as old hopes will when they come back withered ; and they relieved her . '
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 23]: I can not help this weakness , and it makes my purpose stronger , ' said Rose , extending her hand . '
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 10]: I must leave you now , indeed . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 9]: I ask one promise , ' said Harry .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 38]: ` Once , and only once more , -- say within a year , but it may be much sooner , -- I may speak to you again on this subject , for the last time . '
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 27]: ` Not to press me to alter my right determination , ' replied Rose , with a melancholy smile ; ` it will be useless . '
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 22]: ` No , ' said Harry ; ` to hear you repeat it , if you will -- finally repeat it !
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 40]: I will lay at your feet , whatever of station of fortune I may possess ; and if you still adhere to your present resolution , will not seek , by word or act , to change it . '
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 34]: ` Then let it be so , ' rejoined Rose ; ` it is but one pang the more , and by that time I may be enabled to bear it better . '
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 6]: She extended her hand again .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 24]: But the young man caught her to his bosom ; and imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead , hurried from the room .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 62]: CHAPTER XXXVI IS A VERY SHORT ONE , AND MAY APPEAR OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE IN ITS PLACE , BUT IT SHOULD BE READ NOTWITHSTANDING , AS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST , AND A KEY TO ONE THAT WILL FOLLOW WHEN ITS TIME ARRIVES ` And so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning ; eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 15]: said the doctor , as Harry Maylie joined him and Oliver at the breakfast-table .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 17]: ` Why , you are not in the same mind or intention two half-hours together ! '
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 24]: ` You will tell me a different tale one of these days , ' said Harry , colouring without any perceptible reason . '
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 27]: I hope I may have good cause to do so , ' replied Mr. Losberne ; ` though I confess I do n't think I shall .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 34]: But yesterday morning you had made up your mind , in a great hurry , to stay here , and to accompany your mother , like a dutiful son , to the sea-side .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 29]: Before noon , you announce that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as I go , on your road to London .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 51]: And at night , you urge me , with great mystery , to start before the ladies are stirring ; the consequence of which is , that young Oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 11]: Too bad , is n't it , Oliver ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 26]: I should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and Mr. Maylie went away , sir , ' rejoined Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 23]: ` That 's a fine fellow , ' said the doctor ; ` you shall come and see me when you return .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 27]: But , to speak seriously , Harry ; has any communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be gone ? '
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 64]: ` The great nobs , ' replied Harry , ` under which designation , I presume , you include my most stately uncle , have not communicated with me at all , since I have been here ; nor , at this time of the year , is it likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them . '
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 15]: ` Well , ' said the doctor , ` you are a queer fellow .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 29]: But of course they will get you into parliament at the election before Christmas , and these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 6]: There 's something in that .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 19]: Good training is always desirable , whether the race be for place , cup , or sweepstakes . '
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 48]: Harry Maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a little ; but he contented himself with saying , ` We shall see , ' and pursued the subject no farther .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 29]: The post-chaise drove up to the door shortly afterwards ; and Giles coming in for the luggage , the good doctor bustled out , to see it packed .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 23]: ` Oliver , ' said Harry Maylie , in a low voice , ` let me speak a word with you . '
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 29]: Oliver walked into the window-recess to which Mr. Maylie beckoned him ; much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits , which his whole behaviour displayed .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 8]: ` You can write well now ? '
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 11]: said Harry , laying his hand upon his arm . '
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 11]: I hope so , sir , ' replied Oliver . '
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 38]: I shall not be at home again , perhaps for some time ; I wish you would write to me -- say once a fort-night : every alternate Monday : to the General Post Office in London .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 4]: Will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 23]: certainly , sir ; I shall be proud to do it , ' exclaimed Oliver , greatly delighted with the commission . '
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 58]: I should like to know how -- how my mother and Miss Maylie are , ' said the young man ; ` and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you take , and what you talk about , and whether she -- they , I mean -- seem happy and quite well .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 5]: You understand me ? '
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 11]: quite , sir , quite , ' replied Oliver . '
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 44]: I would rather you did not mention it to them , ' said Harry , hurrying over his words ; ` because it might make my mother anxious to write to me oftener , and it is a trouble and worry to her .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 17]: Let is be a secret between you and me ; and mind you tell me everything !
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 6]: I depend upon you . '
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 24]: Oliver , quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance , faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 16]: Mr. Maylie took leave of him , with many assurances of his regard and protection .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 40]: The doctor was in the chaise ; Giles -LRB- who , it had been arranged , should be left behind -RRB- held the door open in his hand ; and the women-servants were in the garden , looking on .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 16]: Harry cast one slight glance at the latticed window , and jumped into the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 5]: ` Drive on ! '
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 11]: he cried , ` hard , fast , full gallop !
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 13]: Nothing short of flying will keep pace with me , to-day . '
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 4]: ` Halloa ! '
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 32]: cried the doctor , letting down the front glass in a great hurry , and shouting to the postillion ; ` something very short of flyng will keep pace with me .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 5]: Do you hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 61]: Jingling and clattering , till distance rendered its noise inaudible , and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye , the vehicle wound its way along the road , almost hidden in a cloud of dust : now wholly disappearing , and now becoming visible again , as intervening objects , or the intricacies of the way , permitted .
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 20]: It was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer to be seen , that the gazers dispersed .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 53]: And there was one looker-on , who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot where the carriage had disappeared , long after it was many miles away ; for , behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when Harry raised his eyes towards the window , sat Rose herself .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 17]: ` He seems in high spirits and happy , ' she said , at length . '
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 10]: I feared for a time he might be otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 4]: I was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 8]: I am very , very glad . '
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 44]: Tears are signs of gladness as well as grief ; but those which coursed down Rose 's face , as she sat pensively at the window , still gazing in the same direction , seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 69]: CHAPTER XXXVII IN WHICH THE READER MAY PERCEIVE A CONTRAST , NOT UNCOMMON IN MATRIMONIAL CASES Mr. Bumble sat in the workhouse parlour , with his eyes moodily fixed on the cheerless grate , whence , as it was summer time , no brighter gleam proceeded , than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun , which were sent back from its cold and shining surface .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 48]: A paper fly-cage dangled from the ceiling , to which he occasionally raised his eyes in gloomy thought ; and , as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy net-work , Mr. Bumble would heave a deep sigh , while a more gloomy shadow overspread his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 24]: Mr. Bumble was meditating ; it might be that the insects brought to mind , some painful passage in his own past life .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 22]: Nor was Mr. Bumble 's gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 32]: There were not wanting other appearances , and those closely connected with his own person , which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of his affairs .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 13]: The laced coat , and the cocked hat ; where were they ?
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 21]: He still wore knee-breeches , and dark cotton stockings on his nether limbs ; but they were not THE breeches .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 19]: The coat was wide-skirted ; and in that respect like THE coat , but , oh how different !
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 12]: The mighty cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 8]: Mr. Bumble was no longer a beadle .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 32]: There are some promotions in life , which , independent of the more substantial rewards they offer , require peculiar value and dignity from the coats and waistcoats connected with them .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 24]: A field-marshal has his uniform ; a bishop his silk apron ; a counsellor his silk gown ; a beadle his cocked hat .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 20]: Strip the bishop of his apron , or the beadle of his hat and lace ; what are they ?
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 2]: Men .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 3]: Mere men .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 21]: Dignity , and even holiness too , sometimes , are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some people imagine .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 14]: Mr. Bumle had married Mrs. Corney , and was master of the workhouse .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 7]: Another beadle had come into power .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 17]: On him the cocked hat , gold-laced coat , and staff , had all three descended .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 10]: ` And to-morrow two months it was done ! '
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 8]: said Mr. Bumble , with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 7]: ` It seems a age . '
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 38]: Mr. Bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence of happiness into the short space of eight weeks ; but the sigh -- there was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh . '
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 44]: I sold myself , ' said Mr. Bumble , pursuing the same train of relection , ` for six teaspoons , a pair of sugar-tongs , and a milk-pot ; with a small quantity of second-hand furniture , and twenty pound in money .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 5]: I went very reasonable .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 6]: Cheap , dirt cheap ! '
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 4]: ` Cheap ! '
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 34]: cried a shrill voice in Mr. Bumble 's ear : ` you would have been dear at any price ; and dear enough I paid for you , Lord above knows that ! '
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 36]: Mr. Bumble turned , and encountered the face of his interesting consort , who , imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his complaint , had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 7]: ` Mrs. Bumble , ma'am ! '
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 9]: said Mr. Bumble , with a sentimental sternness .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 4]: cried the lady .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 20]: ` Have the goodness to look at me , ' said Mr. Bumble , fixing his eyes upon her .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 23]: -LRB- If she stands such a eye as that , ' said Mr. Bumble to himself , ` she can stand anything .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 12]: It is a eye I never knew to fail with paupers .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 13]: If it fails with her , my power is gone . ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 44]: Whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell paupers , who , being lightly fed , are in no very high condition ; or whether the late Mrs. Corney was particularly proof against eagle glances ; are matters of opinion .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 48]: The matter of fact , is , that the matron was in no way overpowered by Mr. Bumble 's scowl , but , on the contrary , treated it with great disdain , and even raised a laugh threreat , which sounded as though it were genuine .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 18]: On hearing this most unexpected sound , Mr. Bumble looked , first incredulous , and afterwards amazed .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 26]: He then relapsed into his former state ; nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened by the voice of his partner .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 13]: ` Are you going to sit snoring there , all day ? '
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 5]: inquired Mrs. Bumble . '
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 54]: I am going to sit here , as long as I think proper , ma'am , ' rejoined Mr. Bumble ; ` and although I was NOT snoring , I shall snore , gape , sneeze , laugh , or cry , as the humour strikes me ; such being my prerogative . '
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 5]: ` Your PREROGATIVE ! '
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 9]: sneered Mrs. Bumble , with ineffable contempt . '
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 12]: I said the word , ma'am , ' said Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 11]: ` The prerogative of a man is to command . '
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 17]: ` And what 's the prerogative of a woman , in the name of Goodness ? '
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 8]: cried the relict of Mr. Corney deceased .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 11]: ` To obey , ma'am , ' thundered Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 23]: ` Your late unfortunate husband should have taught it you ; and then , perhaps , he might have been alive now .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 9]: I wish he was , poor man ! '
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 75]: Mrs. Bumble , seeing at a glance , that the decisive moment had now arrived , and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or other , must necessarily be final and conclusive , no sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone , than she dropped into a chair , and with a loud scream that Mr. Bumble was a hard-hearted brute , fell into a paroxysm of tears .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 22]: But , tears were not the things to find their way to Mr. Bumble 's soul ; his heart was waterproof .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 45]: Like washable beaver hats that improve with rain , his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous , by showers of tears , which , being tokens of weakness , and so far tacit admissions of his own power , please and exalted him .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 42]: He eyed his good lady with looks of great satisfaction , and begged , in an encouraging manner , that she should cry her hardest : the exercise being looked upon , by the faculty , as stronly conducive to health .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 25]: ` It opens the lungs , washes the countenance , exercises the eyes , and softens down the temper , ' said Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 6]: ` So cry away . '
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 70]: As he discharged himself of this pleasantry , Mr. Bumble took his hat from a peg , and putting it on , rather rakishly , on one side , as a man might , who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner , thrust his hands into his pockets , and sauntered towards the door , with much ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 47]: Now , Mrs. Corney that was , had tried the tears , because they were less troublesome than a manual assault ; but , she was quite prepared to make trial of the latter mode of proceeding , as Mr. Bumble was not long in discovering .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 34]: The first proof he experienced of the fact , was conveyed in a hollow sound , immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the opposite end of the room .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 41]: This preliminary proceeding laying bare his head , the expert lady , clasping him tightly round the throat with one hand , inflicted a shower of blows -LRB- dealt with singular vigour and dexterity -RRB- upon it with the other .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 68]: This done , she created a little variety by scratching his face , and tearing his hair ; and , having , by this time , inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the offence , she pushed him over a chair , which was luckily well situated for the purpose : and defied him to talk about his prerogative again , if he dared .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 5]: ` Get up ! '
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 10]: said Mrs. Bumble , in a voice of command .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 18]: ` And take yourself away from here , unless you want me to do something desperate . '
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 17]: Mr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance : wondering much what something desperate might be .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 11]: Picking up his hat , he looked towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 6]: ` Are you going ? '
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 4]: demanded Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 22]: ` Certainly , my dear , certainly , ' rejoined Mr. Bumble , making a quicker motion towards the door . '
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 13]: I did n't intend to -- I 'm going , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 34]: You are so very violent , that really I -- ' At this instant , Mrs. Bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the carpet , which had been kicked up in the scuffle .
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 30]: Mr. Bumble immediately darted out of the room , without bestowing another thought on his unfinished sentence : leaving the late Mrs. Corney in full possession of the field .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 12]: Mr. Bumble was fairly taken by surprise , and fairly beaten .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 34]: He had a decided propensity for bullying : derived no inconsiderable pleasure from the exercise of petty cruelty ; and , consequently , was -LRB- it is needless to say -RRB- a coward .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 32]: This is by no means a disparagement to his character ; for many official personages , who are held in high respect and admiration , are the victims of similar infirmities .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 32]: The remark is made , indeed , rather in his favour than otherwise , and with a view of impressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for office .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 12]: But , the measure of his degradation was not yet full .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 99]: After making a tour of the house , and thinking , for the first time , that the poor-laws really were too hard on people ; and that men who ran away from their wives , leaving them chargeable to the parish , ought , in justice to be visited with no punishment at all , but rather rewarded as meritorious individuals who had suffered much ; Mr. Bumble came to a room where some of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish linen : when the sound of voices in conversation , now proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 4]: ` Hem ! '
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 11]: said Mr. Bumble , summoning up all his native dignity .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 12]: ` These women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 2]: Hallo !
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 3]: hallo there !
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 12]: What do you mean by this noise , you hussies ? '
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 47]: With these words , Mr. Bumble opened the door , and walked in with a very fierce and angry manner : which was at once exchanged for a most humiliated and cowering air , as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the form of his lady wife .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 19]: ` My dear , ' said Mr. Bumble , ' I did n't know you were here . '
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 9]: ` Did n't know I was here ! '
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 4]: repeated Mrs. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 9]: ` What do YOU do here ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 47]: I thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work properly , my dear , ' replied Mr. Bumble : glancing distractedly at a couple of old women at the wash-tub , who were comparing notes of admiration at the workhouse-master 's humility .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 10]: ` YOU thought they were talking too much ? '
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 4]: said Mrs. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 9]: ` What business is it of yours ? '
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 12]: ` Why , my dear -- ' urged Mr. Bumble submissively .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 9]: ` What business is it of yours ? '
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 6]: demanded Mrs. Bumble , again .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 34]: ` It 's very true , you 're matron here , my dear , ' submitted Mr. Bumble ; ` but I thought you might n't be in the way just then . '
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 15]: ` I 'll tell you what , Mr. Bumble , ' returned his lady .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 10]: ` We do n't want any of your interference .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 46]: You 're a great deal too fond of poking your nose into things that do n't concern you , making everybody in the house laugh , the moment your back is turned , and making yourself look like a fool every hour in the day .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 6]: Be off ; come ! '
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 28]: Mr. Bumble , seeing with excruciating feelings , the delight of the two old paupers , who were tittering together most rapturously , hesitated for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 40]: Mrs. Bumble , whose patience brooked no delay , caught up a bowl of soap-suds , and motioning him towards the door , ordered him instantly to depart , on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly person .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 6]: What could Mr. Bumble do ?
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 31]: He looked dejectedly round , and slunk away ; and , as he reached the door , the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 5]: It wanted but this .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 40]: He was degraded in their eyes ; he had lost caste and station before the very paupers ; he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship , to the lowest depth of the most snubbed hen-peckery .
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 7]: ` All in two months ! '
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 9]: said Mr. Bumble , filled with dismal thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 4]: ` Two months !
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 32]: No more than two months ago , I was not only my own master , but everybody else 's , so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned , and now !
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 7]: -- ' It was too much .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 35]: Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the gate for him -LRB- for he had reached the portal in his reverie -RRB- ; and walked , distractedly , into the street .
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 31]: He walked up one street , and down another , until exercise had abated the first passion of his grief ; and then the revulsion of feeling made him thirsty .
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 41]: He passed a great many public-houses ; but , at length paused before one in a by-way , whose parlour , as he gathered from a hasty peep over the blinds , was deserted , save by one solitary customer .
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 11]: It began to rain , heavily , at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 4]: This determined him .
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 29]: Mr. Bumble stepped in ; and ordering something to drink , as he passed the bar , entered the apartment into which he had looked from the street .
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 18]: The man who was seated there , was tall and dark , and wore a large cloak .
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 36]: He had the air of a stranger ; and seemed , by a certain haggardness in his look , as well as by the dusty soils on his dress , to have travelled some distance .
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 22]: He eyed Bumble askance , as he entered , but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his salutation .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 39]: Mr. Bumble had quite dignity enough for two ; supposing even that the stranger had been more familiar : so he drank his gin-and-water in silence , and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 81]: It so happened , however : as it will happen very often , when men fall into company under such circumstances : that Mr. Bumble felt , every now and then , a powerful inducement , which he could not resist , to steal a look at the stranger : and that whenever he did so , he withdrew his eyes , in some confusion , to find that the stranger was at that moment stealing a look at him .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 46]: Mr. Bumble 's awkwardness was enhanced by the very remarkable expression of the stranger 's eye , which was keen and bright , but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion , unlike anything he had ever observed before , and repulsive to behold .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 27]: When they had encountered each other 's glance several times in this way , the stranger , in a harsh , deep voice , broke silence .
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 21]: ` Were you looking for me , ' he said , ` when you peered in at the window ? '
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 44]: ` Not that I am aware of , unless you 're Mr. -- ' Here Mr. Bumble stopped short ; for he was curious to know the stranger 's name , and thought in his impatience , he might supply the blank . '
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 29]: I see you were not , ' said the stranger ; and expression of quiet sarcasm playing about his mouth ; ` or you have known my name .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 6]: You do n't know it .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 12]: I would recommend you not to ask for it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 15]: I meant no harm , young man , ' observed Mr. Bumble , majestically .
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 11]: ` And have done none , ' said the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 16]: Another silence succeeded this short dialogue : which was again broken by the stranger . '
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 10]: I have seen you before , I think ? '
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 25]: ` You were differently dressed at that time , and I only passed you in the street , but I should know you again .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 13]: You were beadle here , once ; were you not ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 17]: I was , ' said Mr. Bumble , in some surprise ; ` porochial beadle . '
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 13]: ` Just so , ' rejoined the other , nodding his head .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 10]: ` It was in that character I saw you .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 6]: What are you now ? '
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 26]: ` Master of the workhouse , ' rejoined Mr. Bumble , slowly and impressively , to check any undue familiarity the stranger might otherwise assume .
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 10]: ` Master of the workhouse , young man ! '
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 21]: ` You have the same eye to your own interest , that you always had , I doubt not ? '
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 22]: resumed the stranger , looking keenly into Mr. Bumble 's eyes , as he raised them in astonishment at the question .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 10]: ` Do n't scruple to answer freely , man .
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 11]: I know you pretty well , you see . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 52]: I suppose , a married man , ' replied Mr. Bumble , shading his eyes with his hand , and surveying the stranger , from head to foot , in evident perplexity , ` is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can , than a single one .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 31]: Porochial officers are not so well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee , when it comes to them in a civil and proper manner . '
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 27]: The stranger smiled , and nodded his head again : as much to say , he had not mistaken his man ; then rang the bell .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 20]: ` Fill this glass again , ' he said , handing Mr. Bumble 's empty tumbler to the landlord .
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 8]: ` Let it be strong and hot .
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 9]: You like it so , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 15]: ` Not too strong , ' replied Mr. Bumble , with a delicate cough .
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 10]: ` You understand what that means , landlord ! '
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 6]: said the stranger , drily .
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 30]: The host smiled , disappeared , and shortly afterwards returned with a steaming jorum : of which , the first gulp brought the water into Mr. Bumble 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 19]: ` Now listen to me , ' said the stranger , after closing the door and window . '
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 52]: I came down to this place , to-day , to find you out ; and , by one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends sometimes , you walked into the very room I was sitting in , while you were uppermost in my mind .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 7]: I want some information from you .
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 16]: I do n't ask you to give it for mothing , slight as it is .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 9]: Put up that , to begin with . '
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 32]: As he spoke , he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his companion , carefully , as though unwilling that the chinking of money should be heard without .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 51]: When Mr. Bumble had scrupulously examined the coins , to see that they were genuine , and had put them up , with much satisfaction , in his waistcoat-pocket , he went on : ` Carry your memory back -- let me see -- twelve years , last winter . '
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 12]: ` It 's a long time , ' said Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 4]: ` Very good .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 6]: I 've done it . '
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 8]: ` The scene , the workhouse . '
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 4]: ` Good ! '
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 8]: ` And the time , night . '
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 52]: ` And the place , the crazy hole , wherever it was , in which miserable drabs brought forth the life and health so often denied to themselves -- gave birth to puling children for the parish to rear ; and hid their shame , rot 'em in the grave ! '
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 9]: ` The lying-in room , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 13]: said Mr. Bumble , not quite following the stranger 's excited description .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 9]: ` Yes , ' said the stranger . '
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 8]: A boy was born there . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 16]: A many boys , ' observed Mr. Bumble , shaking his head , despondingly . '
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 8]: A murrain on the young devils ! '
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 54]: cried the stranger ; ' I speak of one ; a meek-looking , pale-faced boy , who was apprenticed down here , to a coffin-maker -- I wish he had made his coffin , and screwed his body in it -- and who afterwards ran away to London , as it was supposed .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 7]: ` Why , you mean Oliver !
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 4]: Young Twist ! '
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 12]: said Mr. Bumble ; ' I remember him , of course .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 50]: There was n't a obstinater young rascal -- ' ` It 's not of him I want to hear ; I 've heard enough of him , ' said the stranger , stopping Mr. Bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject of poor Oliver 's vices .
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 14]: ` It 's of a woman ; the hag that nursed his mother .
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 5]: Where is she ? '
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 6]: ` Where is she ? '
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 11]: said Mr. Bumble , whom the gin-and-water had rendered facetious .
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 8]: ` It would be hard to tell .
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 25]: There 's no midwifery there , whichever place she 's gone to ; so I suppose she 's out of employment , anyway . '
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 6]: demanded the stranger , sternly .
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 12]: ` That she died last winter , ' rejoined Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 41]: The man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information , and although he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards , his gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted , and he seemed lost in thought .
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 40]: For some time , he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be relieved or disappointed by the intelligence ; but at length he breathed more freely ; and withdrawing his eyes , observed that it was no great matter .
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 10]: With that he rose , as if to depart .
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 33]: But Mr. Bumble was cunning enough ; and he at once saw that an opportunity was opened , for the lucrative disposal of some secret in the possession of his better half .
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 90]: He well remembered the night of old Sally 's death , which the occurrences of that day had given him good reason to recollect , as the occasion on which he had proposed to Mrs. Corney ; and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure of which she had been the solitary witness , he had heard enough to know that it related to something that had occurred in the old woman 's attendance , as workhouse nurse , upon the young mother of Oliver Twist .
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 55]: Hastily calling this circumstance to mind , he informed the stranger , with an air of mystery , that one woman had been closeted with the old harridan shortly before she died ; and that she could , as he had reason to believe , throw some light on the subject of his inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 8]: ` How can I find her ? '
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 28]: said the stranger , thrown off his guard ; and plainly showing that all his fears -LRB- whatever they were -RRB- were aroused afresh by the intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 10]: ` Only through me , ' rejoined Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 4]: ` When ? '
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 6]: cried the stranger , hastily .
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 7]: ` To-morrow , ' rejoined Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 51]: ` At nine in the evening , ' said the stranger , producing a scrap of paper , and writing down upon it , an obscure address by the water-side , in characters that betrayed his agitation ; ` at nine in the evening , bring her to me there .
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 9]: I need n't tell you to be secret .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 6]: It 's your interest . '
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 24]: With these words , he led the way to the door , after stopping to pay for the liquor that had been drunk .
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 28]: Shortly remarking that their roads were different , he departed , without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 16]: On glancing at the address , the parochial functionary observed that it contained no name .
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 16]: The stranger had not gone far , so he made after him to ask it .
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 7]: ` What do you want ? '
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 4]: cried the man .
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 12]: turning quickly round , as Bumble touched him on the arm .
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 5]: ` Following me ? '
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 19]: ` Only to ask a question , ' said the other , pointing to the scrap of paper .
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 10]: ` What name am I to ask for ? '
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 4]: ` Monks ! '
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 10]: rejoined the man ; and strode hastily , away .
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 33]: CHAPTER XXXVIII CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MR. AND MRS. BUMBLE , AND MR. MONKS , AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW It was a dull , close , overcast summer evening .
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 88]: The clouds , which had been threatening all day , spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour , already yielded large drops of rain , and seemed to presage a violent thunder-storm , when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble , turning out of the main street of the town , directed their course towards a scattered little colony of ruinous houses , distant from it some mile and a-half , or thereabouts , and erected on a low unwholesome swamp , bordering upon the river .
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 34]: They were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments , which might , perhaps , serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the rain , and sheltering them from observation .
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 47]: The husband carried a lantern , from which , however , no light yet shone ; and trudged on , a few paces in front , as though -- the way being dirty -- to give his wife the benefit of treading in his heavy footprints .
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 68]: They went on , in profound silence ; every now and then , Mr. Bumble relaxed his pace , and turned his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following ; then , discovering that she was close at his heels , he mended his rate of walking , and proceeded , at a considerable increase of speed , towards their place of destination .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 44]: This was far from being a place of doubtful character ; for it had long been known as the residence of none but low ruffians , who , under various pretences of living by their labour , subsisted chiefly on plunder and crime .
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 51]: It was a collection of mere hovels : some , hastily built with loose bricks : others , of old worm-eaten ship-timber : jumbled together without any attempt at order or arrangement , and planted , for the most part , within a few feet of the river 's bank .
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 104]: A few leaky boats drawn up on the mud , and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it : and here and there an oar or coil of rope : appeared , at first , to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some avocation on the river ; but a glance at the shattered and useless condition of the articles thus displayed , would have led a passer-by , without much difficulty , to the conjecture that they were disposed there , rather for the preservation of appearances , than with any view to their being actually employed .
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 34]: In the heart of this cluster of huts ; and skirting the river , which its upper stories overhung ; stood a large building , formerly used as a manufactory of some kind .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 18]: It had , in its day , probably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements .
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 9]: But it had long since gone to ruin .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 71]: The rat , the worm , and the action of the damp , had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood ; and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the water ; while the remainder , tottering and bending over the dark stream , seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion , and involving itself in the same fate .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 32]: It was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused , as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air , and the rain commenced pouring violently down .
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 23]: ` The place should be somewhere here , ' said Bumble , consulting a scrap of paper he held in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 5]: ` Halloa there ! '
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 6]: cried a voice from above .
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 26]: Following the sound , Mr. Bumble raised his head and descried a man looking out of a door , breast-high , on the second story .
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 21]: ` Stand still , a minute , ' cried the voice ; ` I 'll be with you directly . '
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 11]: With which the head disappeared , and the door closed .
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 7]: ` Is that the man ? '
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 7]: asked Mr. Bumble 's good lady .
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 7]: Mr. Bumble nodded in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 35]: ` Then , mind what I told you , ' said the matron : ` and be careful to say as little as you can , or you 'll betray us at once . '
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 61]: Mr. Bumble , who had eyed the building with very rueful looks , was apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of proceeding any further with the enterprise just then , when he was prevented by the appearance of Monks : w ho opened a small door , near which they stood , and beckoned them inwards .
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 5]: ` Come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 11]: he cried impatiently , stamping his foot upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 8]: ` Do n't keep me here ! '
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 18]: The woman , who had hesitated at first , walked boldly in , without any other invitation .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 34]: Mr. Bumble , who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind , followed : obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 15]: ` What the devil made you stand lingering there , in the wet ? '
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 19]: said Monks , turning round , and addressing Bumble , after he had bolted the door behind them .
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 18]: ` We -- we were only cooling ourselves , ' stammered Bumble , looking apprehensively about him .
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 5]: ` Cooling yourselves ! '
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 3]: retorted Monks .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 33]: ` Not all the rain that ever fell , or ever will fall , will put as much of hell 's fire out , as a man can carry about with him .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 14]: You wo n't cool yourself so easily ; do n't think it ! '
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 44]: With this agreeable speech , Monks turned short upon the matron , and bent his gaze upon her , till even she , who was not easily cowed , was fain to withdraw her eyes , and turn them them towards the ground .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 10]: ` This is the woman , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 3]: demanded Monks .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 3]: ` Hem !
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 17]: That is the woman , ' replied Mr. Bumble , mindful of his wife 's caution .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 13]: ` You think women never can keep secrets , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 20]: said the matron , interposing , and returning , as she spoke , the searching look of Monks . '
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 17]: I know they will always keep ONE till it 's found out , ' said Monks .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 8]: ` And what may that be ? '
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 4]: asked the matron .
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 13]: ` The loss of their own good name , ' replied Monks .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 38]: ` So , by the same rule , if a woman 's a party to a secret that might hang or transport her , I 'm not afraid of her telling it to anybody ; not I !
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 7]: Do you understand , mistress ? '
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 14]: ` No , ' rejoined the matron , slightly colouring as she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 8]: ` Of course you do n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 3]: said Monks .
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 6]: ` How should you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 41]: Bestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his two companions , and again beckoning them to follow him , the man hastened across the apartment , which was of considerable extent , but low in the roof .
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 48]: He was preparing to ascend a steep staircase , or rather ladder , leading to another floor of warehouses above : when a bright flash of lightning streamed down the aperture , and a peal of thunder followed , which shook the crazy building to its centre .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 5]: ` Hear it ! '
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 6]: he cried , shrinking back .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 4]: ` Hear it !
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 20]: Rolling and crashing on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding from it .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 6]: I hate the sound ! '
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 37]: He remained silent for a few moments ; and then , removing his hands suddenly from his face , showed , to the unspeakable discomposure of Mr. Bumble , that it was much distorted and discoloured .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 27]: ` These fits come over me , now and then , ' said Monks , observing his alarm ; ` and thunder sometimes brings them on .
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 15]: Do n't mind me now ; it 's all over for this once . '
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 67]: Thus speaking , he led the way up the ladder ; and hastily closing the window-shutter of the room into which it led , lowered a lantern which hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy beams in the ceiling : and which cast a dim light upon an old table and three chairs that were placed beneath it .
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 29]: ` Now , ' said Monks , when they had all three seated themselves , ` the sooner we come to our business , the better for all .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 11]: The woman know what it is , does she ? '
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 24]: The question was addressed to Bumble ; but his wife anticipated the reply , by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it .
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 42]: ` He is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died ; and that she told you something -- ' ` About the mother of the boy you named , ' replied the matron interrupting him .
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 14]: ` The first question is , of what nature was her communication ? '
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 3]: said Monks .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 14]: ` That 's the second , ' observed the woman with much deliberation .
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 13]: ` The first is , what may the communication be worth ? '
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 17]: ` Who the devil can tell that , without knowing of what kind it is ? '
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 3]: asked Monks .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 29]: ` Nobody better than you , I am persuaded , ' answered Mrs. Bumble : who did not want for spirit , as her yoke-fellow could abundantly testify .
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 4]: ` Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 25]: said Monks significantly , and with a look of eager inquiry ; ` there may be money 's worth to get , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 11]: ` Perhaps there may , ' was the composed reply .
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 12]: ` Something that was taken from her , ' said Monks .
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 6]: ` Something that she wore .
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 16]: Something that -- ' ` You had better bid , ' interrupted Mrs. Bumble . '
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 22]: I have heard enough , already , to assure me that you are the man I ought to talk to . '
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 72]: Mr. Bumble , who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed , listened to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes : which he directed towards his wife and Monks , by turns , in undisguised astonishment ; increased , if possible , when the latter sternly demanded , what sum was required for the disclosure .
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 9]: ` What 's it worth to you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 9]: asked the woman , as collectedly as before .
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 16]: ` It may be nothing ; it may be twenty pounds , ' replied Monks .
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 11]: ` Speak out , and let me know which . '
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 33]: ` Add five pounds to the sum you have named ; give me five-and-twenty pounds in gold , ' said the woman ; ` and I 'll tell you all I know .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 4]: Not before . '
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 5]: ` Five-and-twenty pounds ! '
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 7]: exclaimed Monks , drawing back . '
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 13]: I spoke as plainly as I could , ' replied Mrs. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 11]: ` It 's not a large sum , either . '
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 20]: ` Not a large sum for a paltry secret , that may be nothing when it 's told ! '
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 19]: cried Monks impatiently ; ` and which has been lying dead for twelve years past or more ! '
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 35]: ` Such matters keep well , and , like good wine , often double their value in course of time , ' answered the matron , still preserving the resolute indifference she had assumed .
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 40]: ` As to lying dead , there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come , or twelve million , for anything you or I know , who will tell strange tales at last ! '
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 10]: ` What if I pay it for nothing ? '
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 5]: asked Monks , hesitating .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 15]: ` You can easily take it away again , ' replied the matron . '
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 13]: I am but a woman ; alone here ; and unprotected . '
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 32]: ` Not alone , my dear , nor unprotected , neither , ' submitted Mr. Bumble , in a voice tremulous with fear : ' I am here , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 32]: And besides , ' said Mr. Bumble , his teeth chattering as he spoke , ` Mr. Monks is too much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons .
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 69]: Mr. Monks is aware that I am not a young man , my dear , and also that I am a little run to seed , as I may say ; bu he has heerd : I say I have no doubt Mr. Monks has heerd , my dear : that I am a very determined officer , with very uncommon strength , if I 'm once roused .
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 12]: I only want a little rousing ; that 's all . '
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 69]: As Mr. Bumble spoke , he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern with fierce determination ; and plainly showed , by the alarmed expression of every feature , that he DID want a little rousing , and not a little , prior to making any very warlike demonstration : unless , indeed , against paupers , or other person or persons trained down for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 23]: ` You are a fool , ' said Mrs. Bumble , in reply ; ` and had better hold your tongue . '
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 29]: ` He had better have cut it out , before he came , if he ca n't speak in a lower tone , ' said Monks , grimly .
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 3]: ` So !
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 8]: He 's your husband , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 6]: ` He my husband ! '
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 9]: tittered the matron , parrying the question . '
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 29]: I thought as much , when you came in , ' rejoined Monks , marking the angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 28]: ` So much the better ; I have less hesitation in dealing with two people , when I find that there 's only one will between them .
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 5]: I 'm in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 4]: See here ! '
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 30]: He thrust his hand into a side-pocket ; and producing a canvas bag , told out twenty-five sovereigns on the table , and pushed them over to the woman .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 42]: ` Now , ' he said , ` gather them up ; and when this cursed peal of thunder , which I feel is coming up to break over the house-top , is gone , let 's hear your story . '
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 43]: The thunder , which seemed in fact much nearer , and to shiver and break almost over their heads , having subsided , Monks , raising his face from the table , bent forward to listen to what the woman should say .
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 35]: The faces of the three nearly touched , as the two men leant over the small table in their eagerness to hear , and the woman also leant forward to render her whisper audible .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 37]: The sickly rays of the suspended lantern falling directly upon them , aggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances : which , encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness , looked ghastly in the extreme .
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 26]: ` When this woman , that we called old Sally , died , ' the matron began , ` she and I were alone . '
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 8]: ` Was there no one by ? '
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 20]: asked Monks , in the same hollow whisper ; ` No sick wretch or idiot in some other bed ?
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 15]: No one who could hear , and might , by possibility , understand ? '
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 15]: ` Not a soul , ' replied the woman ; ` we were alone .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 13]: I stood alone beside the body when death came over it . '
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 11]: ` Good , ' said Monks , regarding her attentively .
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 5]: ` Go on . '
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 47]: ` She spoke of a young creature , ' resumed the matron , ` who had brought a child into the world some years before ; not merely in the same room , but in the same bed , in which she then lay dying . '
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 4]: ` Ay ? '
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 16]: said Monks , with quivering lip , and glancing over his shoulder , ` Blood !
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 6]: How things come about ! '
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 33]: ` The child was the one you named to him last night , ' said the matron , nodding carelessly towards her husband ; ` the mother this nurse had robbed . '
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 5]: ` In life ? '
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 3]: asked Monks .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 15]: ` In death , ' replied the woman , with something like a shudder .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 38]: ` She stole from the corpse , when it had hardly turned to one , that which the dead mother had prayed her , with her last breath , to keep for the infant 's sake . '
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 19]: ` She sold it , ' cried Monks , with desperate eagerness ; ` did she sell it ?
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 2]: Where ?
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 2]: When ?
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 3]: To whom ?
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 5]: How long before ? '
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 29]: ` As she told me , with great difficulty , that she had done this , ' said the matron , ` she fell back and died . '
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 6]: ` Without saying more ? '
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 19]: cried Monks , in a voice which , from its very suppression , seemed only the more furious .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 6]: ` It 's a lie !
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 7]: I 'll not be played with .
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 4]: She said more .
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 19]: I 'll tear the life out of you both , but I 'll know what it was . '
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 80]: ` She did n't utter another word , ' said the woman , to all appearance unmoved -LRB- as Mr. Bumble was very far from being -RRB- by the strange man 's violence ; ` but she clutched my gown , violently , with one hand , which was partly closed ; and when I saw that she was dead , and so removed the hand by force , I found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper . '
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 11]: ` Which contained -- ' interposed Monks , stretching forward .
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 17]: ` Nothing , ' replied the woman ; ` it was a pawnbroker 's duplicate . '
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 5]: ` For what ? '
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 3]: demanded Monks .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 10]: ` In good time I 'll tell you . '
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 5]: said the woman . '
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 66]: I judge that she had kept the trinket , for some time , in the hope of turning it to better account ; and then had pawned it ; and had saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbroker 's interest year by year , and prevent its running out ; so that if anything came of it , it could still be redeemed .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 30]: Nothing had come of it ; and , as I tell you , she died with the scrap of paper , all worn and tattered , in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 26]: The time was out in two days ; I thought something might one day come of it too ; and so redeemed the pledge . '
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 7]: ` Where is it now ? '
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 4]: asked Monks quickly .
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 8]: ` THERE , ' replied the woman .
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 40]: And , as if glad to be relieved of it , she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for a French watch , which Monks pouncing upon , tore open with trembling hands .
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 21]: It contained a little gold locket : in which were two locks of hair , and a plain gold wedding-ring .
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 18]: ` It has the word `` Agnes '' engraved on the inside , ' said the woman .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 27]: ` There is a blank left for the surname ; and then follows the date ; which is within a year before the child was born .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 6]: I found out that . '
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 7]: ` And this is all ? '
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 17]: said Monks , after a close and eager scrutiny of the contents of the little packet .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 8]: ` All , ' replied the woman .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 60]: Mr. Bumble drew a long breath , as if he were glad to find that the story was over , and no mention made of taking the five-and-twenty pounds back again ; and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration which had been trickling over his nose , unchecked , during the whole of the previous dialogue . '
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 40]: I know nothing of the story , beyond what I can guess at , ' said his wife addressing Monks , after a short silence ; ` and I want to know nothing ; for it 's safer not .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 12]: But I may ask you two questions , may I ? '
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 28]: ` You may ask , ' said Monks , with some show of surprise ; ` but whether I answer or not is another question . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 16]: -- Which makes three , ' observed Mr. Bumble , essaying a stroke of facetiousness .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 12]: ` Is that what you expected to get from me ? '
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 4]: demanded the matron .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 8]: ` It is , ' replied Monks .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 6]: ` The other question ? '
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 10]: ` What do you propose to do with it ?
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 8]: Can it be used against me ? '
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 13]: ` Never , ' rejoined Monks ; ` nor against me either .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 3]: See here !
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 18]: But do n't move a step forward , or your life is not worth a bulrush . '
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 48]: With these words , he suddenly wheeled the table aside , and pulling an iron ring in the boarding , threw back a large trap-door which opened close at Mr. Bumble 's feet , and caused that gentleman to retire several paces backward , with great precipitation .
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 15]: ` Look down , ' said Monks , lowering the lantern into the gulf .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 6]: ` Do n't fear me .
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 25]: I could have let you down , quietly enough , when you were seated over it , if that had been my game . '
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 27]: Thus encouraged , the matron drew near to the brink ; and even Mr. Bumble himself , impelled by curiousity , ventured to do the same .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 37]: The turbid water , swollen by the heavy rain , was rushing rapidly on below ; and all other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against the green and slimy piles .
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 52]: There had once been a water-mill beneath ; the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes , and fragments of machinery that yet remained , seemed to dart onward , with a new impulse , when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted to stem its headlong course .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 19]: ` If you flung a man 's body down there , where would it be to-morrow morning ? '
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 14]: said Monks , swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 22]: ` Twelve miles down the river , and cut to pieces besides , ' replied Bumble , recoiling at the thought .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 46]: Monks drew the little packet from his breast , where he had hurriedly thrust it ; and tying it to a leaden weight , which had formed a part of some pulley , and was lying on the floor , dropped it into the stream .
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 23]: It fell straight , and true as a die ; clove the water with a scarcely audible splash ; and was gone .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 15]: The three looking into each other 's faces , seemed to breathe more freely .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 16]: said Monks , closing the trap-door , which fell heavily back into its former position .
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 32]: ` If the sea ever gives up its dead , as books say it will , it will keep its gold and silver to itself , and that trash among it .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 16]: We have nothing more to say , and may break up our pleasant party . '
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 14]: ` By all means , ' observed Mr. Bumble , with great alacrity .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 15]: ` You 'll keep a quiet tongue in your head , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 9]: said Monks , with a threatening look . '
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 9]: I am not afraid of your wife . '
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 26]: ` You may depend upon me , young man , ' answered Mr. Bumble , bowing himself gradually towards the ladder , with excessive politeness .
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 21]: ` On everybody 's account , young man ; on my own , you know , Mr. Monks . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 16]: I am glad , for your sake , to hear it , ' remarked Monks .
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 5]: ` Light your lantern !
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 12]: And get away from here as fast as you can . '
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 37]: It was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point , or Mr. Bumble , who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder , would infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below .
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 39]: He lighted his lantern from that which Monks had detached from the rope , and now carried in his hand ; and making no effort to prolong the discourse , descended in silence , followed by his wife .
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 38]: Monks brought up the rear , after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without , and the rushing of the water .
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 60]: They traversed the lower room , slowly , and with caution ; for Monks started at every shadow ; and Mr. Bumble , holding his lantern a foot above the ground , walked not only with remarkable care , but with a marvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure : looking nervously about him for hidden trap-doors .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 36]: The gate at which they had entered , was softly unfastened and opened by Monks ; merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious acquaintance , the married couple emerged into the wet and darkness outside .
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 32]: They were no sooner gone , than Monks , who appeared to entertain an invincible repugnance to being left alone , called to a boy who had been hidden somewhere below .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 20]: Bidding him go first , and bear the light , he returned to the chamber he had just quitted .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 74]: CHAPTER XXXIX INTRODUCES SOME RESPECTABLE CHARACTERS WITH WHOM THE READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED , AND SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE JEW LAID THEIR WORTHY HEADS TOGETHER On the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned in the last chapter , disposed of their little matter of business as therein narrated , Mr. William Sikes , awakening from a nap , drowsily growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was .
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 48]: The room in which Mr. Sikes propounded this question , was not one of those he had tenanted , previous to the Chertsey expedition , although it was in the same quarter of the town , and was situated at no great distance from his former lodgings .
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 48]: It was not , in appearance , so desirable a habitation as his old quarters : being a mean and badly-furnished apartment , of very limited size ; lighted only by one small window in the shelving roof , and abutting on a close and dirty lane .
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 82]: Nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman 's having gone down in the world of late : for a great scarcity of furniture , and total absence of comfort , together with the disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen , bespoke a state of extreme poverty ; while the meagre and attenuated condition of Mr. Sikes himself would have fully confirmed these symptoms , if they had stood in any need of corroboration .
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 56]: The housebreaker was lying on the bed , wrapped in his white great-coat , by way of dressing-gown , and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness , and the addition of a soiled nightcap , and a stiff , black beard of a week 's growth .
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 47]: The dog sat at the bedside : now eyeing his master with a wistful look , and now pricking his ears , and uttering a low growl as some noise in the street , or in the lower part of the house , attracted his attention .
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 72]: Seated by the window , busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which formed a portion of the robber 's ordinary dress , was a female : so pale and reduced with watching and privation , that there would have been considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same Nancy who has already figured in this tale , but for the voice in which she replied to Mr. Sikes 's question .
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 11]: ` Not long gone seven , ' said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 10]: ` How do you feel to-night , Bill ? '
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 20]: ` As weak as water , ' replied Mr. Sikes , with an imprecation on his eyes and limbs .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 19]: ` Here ; lend us a hand , and let me get off this thundering bed anyhow . '
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 36]: Illness had not improved Mr. Sikes 's temper ; for , as the girl raised him up and led him to a chair , he muttered various curses on her awkwardnewss , and struck her .
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 6]: ` Whining are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 3]: said Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 3]: ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 6]: Do n't stand snivelling there .
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 14]: If you ca n't do anything better than that , cut off altogether .
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 6]: D'ye hear me ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 19]: I hear you , ' replied the girl , turning her face aside , and forcing a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 12]: ` What fancy have you got in your head now ? '
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 11]: you 've thought better of it , have you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 12]: growled Sikes , marking the tear which trembled in her eye .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 11]: ` All the better for you , you have . '
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 32]: ` Why , you do n't mean to say , you 'd be hard upon me to-night , Bill , ' said the girl , laying her hand upon his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 4]: cried Mr. Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 5]: ` Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 95]: ` Such a number of nights , ' said the girl , with a touch of woman 's tenderness , which communicated something like sweetness of tone , even to her voice : ` such a number of nights as I 've been patient with you , nursing and caring for you , as if you had been a child : and this the first that I 've seen you like yourself ; you would n't have served me as you did just now , if you 'd thought of that , would you ?
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 10]: Come , come ; say you would n't . '
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 15]: ` Well , then , ' rejoined Mr. Sikes , ' I would n't .
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 13]: Why , damme , now , the girls 's whining again ! '
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 16]: ` It 's nothing , ' said the girl , throwing herself into a chair .
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 9]: ` Do n't you seem to mind me .
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 7]: It 'll soon be over . '
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 7]: ` What 'll be over ? '
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 8]: demanded Mr. Sikes in a savage voice .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 12]: ` What foolery are you up to , now , again ?
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 19]: Get up and bustle about , and do n't come over me with your woman 's nonsense . '
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 73]: At any other time , this remonstrance , and the tone in which it was delivered , would have had the desired effect ; but the girl being really weak and exhausted , dropped her head over the back of the chair , and fainted , before Mr. Sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths with which , on similar occasions , he was accustomed to garnish his threats .
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 59]: Not knowing , very well , what to do , in this uncommon emergency ; for Miss Nancy 's hysterics were usually of that violent kind which the patient fights and struggles out of , without much assistance ; Mr. Sikes tried a little blasphemy : and finding that mode of treatment wholly ineffectual , called for assistance .
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 11]: ` What 's the matter here , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 6]: said Fagin , looking in .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 13]: ` Lend a hand to the girl , ca n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 4]: replied Sikes impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 11]: ` Do n't stand chattering and grinning at me ! '
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 99]: With an exclamation of surprise , Fagin hastened to the girl 's assistance , while Mr. John Dawkins -LRB- otherwise the Artful Dodger -RRB- , who had followed his venerable friend into the room , hastily deposited on the floor a bundle with which he was laden ; and snatching a bottle from the grasp of Master Charles Bates who came close at his heels , uncorked it in a twinkling with his teeth , and poured a portion of its contents down the patient 's throat : previously taking a taste , himself , to prevent mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 35]: ` Give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows , Charley , ' said Mr. Dawkins ; ` and you slap her hands , Fagin , while Bill undoes the petticuts . '
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 42]: These united restoratives , administered with great energy : especially that department consigned to Master Bates , who appeared to consider his share in the proceedings , a piece of unexampled pleasantry : were not long in producing the desired effect .
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 41]: The girl gradually recovered her senses ; and , staggering to a chair by the bedside , hid her face upon the pillow : leaving Mr. Sikes to confront the new comers , in some astonishment at their unlooked-for appearance .
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 12]: ` Why , what evil wind has blowed you here ? '
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 4]: he asked Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 35]: ` No evil wind at all , my dear , for evil winds blow nobody any good ; and I 've brought something good with me , that you 'll be glad to see .
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 27]: Dodger , my dear , open the bundle ; and give Bill the little trifles that we spent all our money on , this morning . '
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 58]: In compliance with Mr. Fagin 's request , the Artful untied this bundle , which was of large size , and formed of an old table-cloth ; and handed the articles it contained , one by one , to Charley Bates : who placed them on the table , with various encomiums on their rarity and excellence .
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 119]: ` Sitch a rabbit pie , Bill , ' exclaimed that young gentleman , disclosing to view a huge pasty ; ` sitch delicate creeturs , with sitch tender limbs , Bill , that the wery bones melt in your mouth , and there 's no occasion to pick 'em ; half a pound of seven and six-penny green , so precious strong that if you mix it with biling water , it 'll go nigh to blow the lid of the tea-pot off ; a pound and a half of moist sugar that the niggers did n't work at all at , afore they got it up to sitch a pitch of goodness , -- oh no !
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 33]: Two half-quartern brans ; pound of best fresh ; piece of double Glo ` ster ; and , to wind up all , some of the richest sort you ever lushed ! '
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 58]: Uttering this last panegyrie , Master Bates produced , from one of his extensive pockets , a full-sized wine-bottle , carefully corked ; while Mr. Dawkins , at the same instant , poured out a wine-glassful of raw spirits from the bottle he carried : which the invalid tossed down his throat without a moment 's hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 10]: said Fagin , rubbing his hands with great satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 13]: ` You 'll do , Bill ; you 'll do now . '
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 4]: ` Do ! '
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 26]: exclaimed Mr. Sikes ; ' I might have been done for , twenty times over , afore you 'd have done anything to help me .
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 22]: What do you mean by leaving a man in this state , three weeks and more , you false-hearted wagabond ? '
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 8]: ` Only hear him , boys ! '
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 7]: said Fagin , shrugging his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 13]: ` And us come to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things . '
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 78]: ` The things is well enough in their way , ' observed Mr. Sikes : a little soothed as he glanced over the table ; ` but what have you got to say for yourself , why you should leave me here , down in the mouth , health , blunt , and everything else ; and take no more notice of me , all this mortal time , than if I was that ` ere dog .
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 9]: -- Drive him down , Charley ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 21]: I never see such a jolly dog as that , ' cried Master Bates , doing as he was desired .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 13]: ` Smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market !
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 20]: He 'd make his fortun ' on the stage that dog would , and rewive the drayma besides . '
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 21]: ` Hold your din , ' cried Sikes , as the dog retreated under the bed : still growling angrily .
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 19]: ` What have you got to say for yourself , you withered old fence , eh ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 23]: I was away from London , a week and more , my dear , on a plant , ' replied the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 9]: ` And what about the other fortnight ? '
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 3]: demanded Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 24]: ` What about the other fortnight that you 've left me lying here , like a sick rat in his hole ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 8]: I could n't help it , Bill .
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 23]: I ca n't go into a long explanation before company ; but I could n't help it , upon my honour . '
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 6]: ` Upon your what ? '
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 7]: growled Sikes , with excessive disgust .
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 3]: ` Here !
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 33]: Cut me off a piece of that pie , one of you boys , to take the taste of that out of my mouth , or it 'll choke me dead . '
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 18]: ` Do n't be out of temper , my dear , ' urged Fagin , submissively . '
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 12]: I have never forgot you , Bill ; never once . '
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 3]: ` No !
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 18]: I 'll pound it that you ha n't , ' replied Sikes , with a bitter grin .
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 61]: ` You 've been scheming and plotting away , every hour that I have laid shivering and burning here ; and Bill was to do this ; and Bill was to do that ; and Bill was to do it all , dirt cheap , as soon as he got well : and was quite poor enough for your work .
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 15]: If it had n't been for the girl , I might have died . '
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 16]: ` There now , Bill , ' remonstrated Fagin , eagerly catching at the word .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 10]: ` If it had n't been for the girl !
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 19]: Who but poor ould Fagin was the means of your having such a handy girl about you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 8]: ` He says true enough there ! '
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 7]: said Nancy , coming hastily forward .
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 10]: ` Let him be ; let him be . '
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 102]: Nancy 's appearance gave a new turn to the conversation ; for the boys , receiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew , began to ply her with liquor : of which , however , she took very sparingly ; while Fagin , assuming an unusual flow of spirits , gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a better temper , by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant banter ; and , moreover , by laughing very heartily at one or two rough jokes , which , after repeated applications to the spirit-bottle , he condescended to make .
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 25]: ` It 's all very well , ' said Mr. Sikes ; ` but I must have some blunt from you to-night . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 15]: I have n't a piece of coin about me , ' replied the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 23]: ` Then you 've got lots at home , ' retorted Sikes ; ` and I must have some from there . '
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 4]: ` Lots ! '
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 9]: cried Fagin , holding up is hands . '
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 59]: I have n't so much as would -- ' ' I do n't know how much you 've got , and I dare say you hardly know yourself , as it would take a pretty long time to count it , ' said Sikes ; ` but I must have some to-night ; and that 's flat . '
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 23]: ` Well , well , ' said Fagin , with a sigh , ` I 'll send the Artful round presently . '
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 15]: ` You wo n't do nothing of the kind , ' rejoined Mr. Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 44]: ` The Artful 's a deal too artful , and would forget to come , or lose his way , or get dodged by traps and so be perwented , or anything for an excuse , if you put him up to it .
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 30]: Nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it , to make all sure ; and I 'll lie down and have a snooze while she 's gone . '
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 76]: After a great deal of haggling and squabbling , Fagin beat down the amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four and sixpence : protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would only leave him eighteen-pence to keep house with ; Mr. Sikes sullenly remarking that if he could n't get any more he must accompany him home ; with the Dodger and Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard .
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 47]: The Jew then , taking leave of his affectionate friend , returned homeward , attended by Nancy and the boys : Mr. Sikes , meanwhile , flinging himself on the bed , and composing himself to sleep away the time until the young lady 's return .
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 58]: In due course , they arrived at Fagin 's abode , where they found Toby Crackit and Mr. Chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage , which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost , and with it , his fifteenth and last sixpence : much to the amusement of his young friends .
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 38]: Mr. Crackit , apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and mental endowments , yawned , and inquiring after Sikes , took up his hat to go .
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 8]: ` Has nobody been , Toby ? '
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 3]: asked Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 25]: ` Not a living leg , ' answered Mr. Crackit , pulling up his collar ; ` it 's been as dull as swipes .
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 18]: You ought to stand something handsome , Fagin , to recompense me for keeping house so long .
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 36]: Damme , I 'm as flat as a juryman ; and should have gone to sleep , as fast as Newgate , if I had n't had the good natur ' to amuse this youngster .
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 12]: Horrid dull , I 'm blessed if I a n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 116]: With these and other ejaculations of the same kind , Mr. Toby Crackit swept up his winnings , and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with a haughty air , as though such small pieces of silver were wholly beneath the consideration of a man of his figure ; this done , he swaggered out of the room , with so much elegance and gentility , that Mr. Chitling , bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots till they were out of sight , assured the company that he considered his acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview , and that he did n't value his losses the snap of his little finger .
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 11]: ` Wot a rum chap you are , Tom ! '
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 10]: said Master Bates , highly amused by this declaration .
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 12]: ` Not a bit of it , ' replied Mr. Chitling .
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 8]: ` Am I , Fagin ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 25]: A very clever fellow , my dear , ' said Fagin , patting him on the shoulder , and winking to his other pupils .
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 16]: ` And Mr. Crackit is a heavy swell ; a n't he , Fagin ? '
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 3]: asked Tom .
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 12]: ` No doubt at all of that , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 19]: ` And it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance ; a n't it , Fagin ? '
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 3]: pursued Tom .
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 10]: ` Very much so , indeed , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 17]: They 're only jealous , Tom , because he wo n't give it to them . '
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 12]: cried Tom , triumphantly , ` that 's where it is !
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 6]: He has cleaned me out .
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 20]: But I can go and earn some more , when I like ; ca n't I , Fagin ? '
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 33]: ` To be sure you can , and the sooner you go the better , Tom ; so make up your loss at once , and do n't lose any more time .
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 2]: Dodger !
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 2]: Charley !
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 9]: It 's time you were on the lay .
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 11]: It 's near ten , and nothing done yet . '
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 123]: In obedience to this hint , the boys , nodding to Nancy , took up their hats , and left the room ; the Dodger and his vivacious friend indulging , as they went , in many witticisms at the expense of Mr. Chitling ; in whose conduct , it is but justice to say , there was nothing very conspicuous or peculiar : inasmuch as there are a great number of spirited young bloods upon town , who pay a much higher price than Mr. Chitling for being seen in good society : and a great number of fine gentlemen -LRB- composing the good society aforesaid -RRB- who established their reputation upon very much the same footing as flash Toby Crackit .
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 26]: ` Now , ' said Fagin , when they had left the room , ` I 'll go and get you that cash , Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 23]: This is only the key of a little cupboard where I keep a few odd things the boys get , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 21]: I never lock up my money , for I 've got none to lock up , my dear -- ha !
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 6]: -- none to lock up .
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 35]: It 's a poor trade , Nancy , and no thanks ; but I 'm fond of seeing the young people about me ; and I bear it all , I bear it all .
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 3]: Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 16]: he said , hastily concealing the key in his breast ; ` who 's that ?
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 3]: Listen ! '
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 50]: The girl , who was sitting at the table with her arms folded , appeared in no way interested in the arrival : or to care whether the person , whoever he was , came or went : until the murmur of a man 's voice reached her ears .
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 28]: The instant she caught the sound , she tore off her bonnet and shawl , with the rapidity of lightning , and thrust them under the table .
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 57]: The Jew , turning round immediately afterwards , she muttered a complaint of the heat : in a tone of languor that contrasted , very remarkably , with the extreme haste and violence of this action : which , however , had been unobserved by Fagin , who had his back towards her at the time .
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 4]: ` Bah ! '
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 24]: he whispered , as though nettled by the interruption ; ` it 's the man I expected before ; he 's coming downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 13]: Not a word about the money while he 's here , Nance .
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 6]: He wo n't stop long .
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 8]: Not ten minutes , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 29]: Laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip , the Jew carried a candle to the door , as a man 's step was heard upon the stairs without .
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 30]: He reached it , at the same moment as the visitor , who , coming hastily into the room , was close upon the girl before he observed her .
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 4]: It was Monks .
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 23]: ` Only one of my young people , ' said Fagin , observing that Monks drew back , on beholding a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 8]: ` Do n't move , Nancy . '
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 73]: The girl drew closer to the table , and glancing at Monks with an air of careless levity , withdrew her eyes ; but as he turned towards Fagin , she stole another look ; so keen and searching , and full of purpose , that if there had been any bystander to observe the change , he could hardly have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person .
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 5]: ` Any news ? '
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 3]: inquired Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 4]: ` Great . '
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 8]: ` And -- and -- good ? '
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 18]: asked Fagin , hesitating as though he feared to vex the other man by being too sanguine .
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 15]: ` Not bad , any way , ' replied Monks with a smile . '
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 8]: I have been prompt enough this time .
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 9]: Let me have a word with you . '
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 28]: The girl drew closer to the table , and made no offer to leave the room , although she could see that Monks was pointing to her .
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 34]: The Jew : perhaps fearing she might say something aloud about the money , if he endeavoured to get rid of her : pointed upward , and took Monks out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 22]: ` Not that infernal hole we were in before , ' she could hear the man say as they went upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 31]: Fagin laughed ; and making some reply which did not reach her , seemed , by the creaking of the boards , to lead his companion to the second story .
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 48]: Before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the house , the girl had slipped off her shoes ; and drawing her gown loosely over her head , and muffling her arms in it , stood at the door , listening with breathless interest .
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 29]: The moment the noise ceased , she glided from the room ; ascended the stairs with incredible softness and silence ; and was lost in the gloom above .
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 35]: The room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more ; the girl glided back with the same unearthly tread ; and , immediately afterwards , the two men were heard descending .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 18]: Monks went at once into the street ; and the Jew crawled upstairs again for the money .
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 20]: When he returned , the girl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet , as if preparing to be gone .
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 5]: ` Why , Nance !
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 22]: , ' exclaimed the Jew , starting back as he put down the candle , ` how pale you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 4]: ` Pale ! '
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 19]: echoed the girl , shading her eyes with her hands , as if to look steadily at him .
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 4]: ` Quite horrible .
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 9]: What have you been doing to yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 29]: ` Nothing that I know of , except sitting in this close place for I do n't know how long and all , ' replied the girl carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 3]: ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 11]: Let me get back ; that 's a dear . '
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 17]: With a sigh for every piece of money , Fagin told the amount into her hand .
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 13]: They parted without more conversation , merely interchanging a ` good-night . '
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 33]: When the girl got into the open street , she sat down upon a doorstep ; and seemed , for a few moments , wholly bewildered and unable to pursue her way .
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 36]: Suddenly she arose ; and hurrying on , in a direction quite opposite to that in which Sikes was awaiting her returned , quickened her pace , until it gradually resolved into a violent run .
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 40]: After completely exhausting herself , she stopped to take breath : and , as if suddenly recollecting herself , and deploring her inability to do something she was bent upon , wrung her hands , and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 68]: It might be that her tears relieved her , or that she felt the full hopelessness of her condition ; but she turned back ; and hurrying with nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction ; partly to recover lost time , and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own thoughts : soon reached the dwelling where she had left the housebreaker .
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 62]: If she betrayed any agitation , when she presented herself to Mr. Sikes , he did not observe it ; for merely inquiring if she had brought the money , and receiving a reply in the affirmative , he uttered a growl of satisfaction , and replacing his head upon the pillow , resumed the slumbers which her arrival had interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 58]: It was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking ; and withal had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his temper ; that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical upon her behaviour and deportment .
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 144]: That she had all the abstracted and nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous step , which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon , would have been obvious to the lynx-eyed Fagin , who would most probably have taken the alarm at once ; but Mr. Sikes lacking the niceties of discrimination , and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour towards everybody ; and being , furthermore , in an unusually amiable condition , as has been already observed ; saw nothing unusual in her demeanor , and indeed , troubled himself so little about her , that , had her agitation been far more perceptible than it was , it would have been very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions .
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 56]: As that day closed in , the girl 's excitement increased ; and , when night came on , and she sat by , watching until the housebreaker should drink himself asleep , there was an unusual paleness in her cheek , and a fire in her eye , that even Sikes observed with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 49]: Mr. Sikes being weak from the fever , was lying in bed , taking hot water with his gin to render it less inflammatory ; and had pushed his glass towards Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time , when these symptoms first struck him .
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 8]: ` Why , burn my body ! '
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 18]: said the man , raising himself on his hands as he stared the girl in the face .
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 11]: ` You look like a corpse come to life again .
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 6]: What 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 4]: ` Matter ! '
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 4]: replied the girl .
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 3]: ` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 11]: What do you look at me so hard for ? '
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 7]: ` What foolery is this ? '
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 14]: demanded Sikes , grasping her by the arm , and shaking her roughly .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 5]: ` What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 5]: What do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 7]: What are you thinking of ? '
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 27]: ` Of many things , Bill , ' replied the girl , shivering , and as she did so , pressing her hands upon her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 5]: ` But , Lord !
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 6]: What odds in that ? '
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 33]: The tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken , seemd to produce a deeper impression on Sikes than the wild and rigid look which had preceded them . '
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 44]: I tell you wot it is , ' said Sikes ; ` if you have n't caught the fever , and got it comin ' on , now , there 's something more than usual in the wind , and something dangerous too .
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 7]: You 're not a-going to -- .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 4]: No , damme !
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 7]: you would n't do that ! '
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 5]: ` Do what ? '
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 4]: asked the girl .
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 42]: ` There ai n't , ' said Sikes , fixing his eyes upon her , and muttering the words to himself ; ` there ai n't a stauncher-hearted gal going , or I 'd have cut her throat three months ago .
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 13]: She 's got the fever coming on ; that 's it . '
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 27]: Fortifying himself with this assurance , Sikes drained the glass to the bottom , and then , with many grumbling oaths , called for his physic .
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 36]: The girl jumped up , with great alacrity ; poured it quickly out , but with her back towards him ; and held the vessel to his lips , while he drank off the contents .
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 44]: ` Now , ' said the robber , ` come and sit aside of me , and put on your own face ; or I 'll alter it so , that you wo n't know it agin when you do want it . '
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 4]: The girl obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 21]: Sikes , locking her hand in his , fell back upon the pillow : turning his eyes upon her face .
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 13]: They closed ; opened again ; closed once more ; again opened .
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 61]: He shifted his position restlessly ; and , after dozing again , and again , for two or three minutes , and as often springing up with a look of terror , and gazing vacantly about him , was suddenly stricken , as it were , while in the very attitude of rising , into a deep and heavy sleep .
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 26]: The grasp of his hand relaxed ; the upraised arm fell languidly by his side ; and he lay like one in a profound trance .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 22]: ` The laudanum has taken effect at last , ' murmured the girl , as she rose from the bedside . '
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 10]: I may be too late , even now . '
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 75]: She hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl : looking fearfully round , from time to time , as if , despite the sleeping draught , she expected every moment to feel the pressure of Sikes 's heavy hand upon her shoulder ; then , stooping softly over the bed , she kissed the robber 's lips ; and then opening and closing the room-door with noiseless touch , hurried from the house .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 24]: A watchman was crying half-past nine , down a dark passage through which she had to pass , in gaining the main thoroughfare .
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 9]: ` Has it long gone the half-hour ? '
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 4]: asked the girl .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 22]: ` It 'll strike the hour in another quarter , ' said the man : raising his lantern to her face .
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 31]: ` And I can not get there in less than an hour or more , ' muttered Nancy : brushing swiftly past him , and gliding rapidly down the street .
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 32]: Many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues through which she tracked her way , in making from Spitalfields towards the West -- End of London .
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 9]: The clock struck ten , increasing her impatience .
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 42]: She tore along the narrow pavement : elbowing the passengers from side to side ; and darting almost under the horses ' heads , crossed crowded streets , where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like .
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 7]: ` The woman is mad ! '
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 14]: said the people , turning to look after her as she rushed away .
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 35]: When she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town , the streets were comparatively deserted ; and here her headlong progress excited a still greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past .
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 59]: Some quickened their pace behind , as though to see whither she was hastening at such an unusual rate ; and a few made head upon her , and looked back , surprised at her undiminished speed ; but they fell off one by one ; and when she neared her place of destination , she was alone .
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 15]: It was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near Hyde Park .
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 24]: As the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door , guided her to the spot , the clock struck eleven .
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 32]: She had loitered for a few paces as though irresolute , and making up her mind to advance ; but the sound determined her , and she stepped into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 7]: The porter 's seat was vacant .
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 15]: She looked round with an air of incertitude , and advanced towards the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 7]: ` Now , young woman ! '
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 22]: said a smartly-dressed female , looking out from a door behind her , ` who do you want here ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 15]: A lady who is stopping in this house , ' answered the girl . '
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 4]: A lady ! '
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 10]: was the reply , accompanied with a scornful look .
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 5]: ` What lady ? '
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 8]: ` Miss Maylie , ' said Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 31]: The young woman , who had by this time , noted her appearance , replied only by a look of virtuous disdain ; and summoned a man to answer her .
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 8]: To him , Nancy repeated her request .
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 9]: ` What name am I to say ? '
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 4]: asked the waiter .
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 13]: ` It 's of no use saying any , ' replied Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 5]: ` Nor business ? '
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 4]: said the man .
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 13]: ` No , nor that neither , ' rejoined the girl . '
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 7]: I must see the lady . '
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 4]: ` Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 10]: said the man , pushing her towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 5]: ` None of this .
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 6]: Take yourself off . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 10]: I shall be carried out if I go ! '
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 23]: said the girl violently ; ` and I can make that a job that two of you wo n't like to do .
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 29]: Is n't there anybody here , ' she said , looking round , ` that will see a simple message carried for a poor wretch like me ? '
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 28]: This appeal produced an effect on a good-tempered-faced man-cook , who with some of the other servants was looking on , and who stepped forward to interfere .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 14]: ` Take it up for her , Joe ; ca n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 4]: said this person .
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 7]: ` What 's the good ? '
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 4]: replied the man .
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 18]: ` You do n't suppose the young lady will see such as her ; do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 52]: This allusion to Nancy 's doubtful character , raised a vast quantity of chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids , who remarked , with great fervour , that the creature was a disgrace to her sex ; and strongly advocated her being thrown , ruthlessly , into the kennel .
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 43]: ` Do what you like with me , ' said the girl , turning to the men again ; ` but do what I ask you first , and I ask you to give this message for God Almighty 's sake . '
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 22]: The soft-hearted cook added his intercession , and the result was that the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery .
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 8]: ` What 's it to be ? '
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 11]: said the man , with one foot on the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 58]: ` That a young woman earnestly asks to speak to Miss Maylie alone , ' said Nancy ; ` and that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to say , she will know whether to hear her business , or to have her turned out of doors as an impostor . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 16]: I say , ' said the man , ` you 're coming it strong ! '
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 21]: ` You give the message , ' said the girl firmly ; ` and let me hear the answer . '
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 5]: The man ran upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 53]: Nancy remained , pale and almost breathless , listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn , of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific ; and of which they became still more so , when the man returned , and said the young woman was to walk upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 17]: ` It 's no good being proper in this world , ' said the first housemaid .
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 19]: ` Brass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire , ' said the second .
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 28]: The third contented herself with wondering ` what ladies was made of ' ; and the fourth took the first in a quartette of ` Shameful ! '
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 6]: with which the Dianas concluded .
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 35]: Regardless of all this : for she had weightier matters at heart : Nancy followed the man , with trembling limbs , to a small ante-chamber , lighted by a lamp from the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 8]: Here he left her , and retired .
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 120]: CHAPTER XL A STRANGE INTERVIEW , WHICH IS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST CHAMBER The girl 's life had been squandered in the streets , and among the most noisome of the stews and dens of London , but there was something of the woman 's original nature left in her still ; and when she heard a light step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered , and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another moment contain , she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame , and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she had sought this interview .
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 28]: But struggling with these better feelings was pride , -- the vice of the lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and self-assured .
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 84]: The miserable companion of thieves and ruffians , the fallen outcast of low haunts , the associate of the scourings of the jails and hulks , living within the shadow of the gallows itself , -- even this degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the womanly feeling which she thought a weakness , but which alone connected her with that humanity , of which her wasting life had obliterated so many , many traces when a very child .
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 55]: She raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl ; then , bending them on the ground , she tossed her head with affected carelessness as she said : ` It 's a hard matter to get to see you , lady .
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 34]: If I had taken offence , and gone away , as many would have done , you 'd have been sorry for it one day , and not without reason either . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 17]: I am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you , ' replied Rose .
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 7]: ` Do not think of that .
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 9]: Tell me why you wished to see me .
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 9]: I am the person you inquired for . '
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 38]: The kind tone of this answer , the sweet voice , the gentle manner , the absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure , took the girl completely by surprise , and she burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 8]: ` Oh , lady , lady ! '
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 34]: she said , clasping her hands passionately before her face , ` if there was more like you , there would be fewer like me , -- there would -- there would ! '
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 10]: ` Sit down , ' said Rose , earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 25]: ` If you are in poverty or affliction I shall be truly glad to relieve you if I can , -- I shall indeed .
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 4]: Sit down . '
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 30]: ` Let me stand , lady , ' said the girl , still weeping , ` and do not speak to me so kindly till you know me better .
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 5]: It is growing late .
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 9]: Is -- is -- that door shut ? '
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 25]: ` Yes , ' said Rose , recoiling a few steps , as if to be nearer assistance in case she should require it .
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 4]: ` Why ? '
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 25]: ` Because , ' said the girl , ' I am about to put my life and the lives of others in your hands .
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 26]: I am the girl that dragged little Oliver back to old Fagin 's on the night he went out from the house in Pentonville . '
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 4]: ` You ! '
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 4]: said Rose Maylie .
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 6]: ` I , lady ! '
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 5]: replied the girl . '
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 54]: I am the infamous creature you have heard of , that lives among the thieves , and that never from the first moment I can recollect my eyes and senses opening on London streets have known any better life , or kinder words than they have given me , so help me God !
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 10]: Do not mind shrinking openly from me , lady .
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 21]: I am younger than you would think , to look at me , but I am well used to it .
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 17]: The poorest women fall back , as I make my way along the crowded pavement . '
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 8]: ` What dreadful things are these ! '
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 10]: said Rose , involuntarily falling from her strange companion .
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 65]: ` Thank Heaven upon your knees , dear lady , ' cried the girl , ` that you had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood , and that you were never in the midst of cold and hunger , and riot and drunkenness , and -- and -- something worse than all -- as I have been from my cradle .
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 24]: I may use the word , for the alley and the gutter were mine , as they will be my deathbed . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 5]: I pity you ! '
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 8]: said Rose , in a broken voice .
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 10]: ` It wrings my heart to hear you ! '
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 9]: ` Heaven bless you for your goodness ! '
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 4]: rejoined the girl .
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 16]: ` If you knew what I am sometimes , you would pity me , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 29]: But I have stolen away from those who would surely murder me , if they knew I had been here , to tell you what I have overheard .
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 9]: Do you know a man named Monks ? '
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 7]: ` No , ' said Rose .
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 34]: ` He knows you , ' replied the girl ; ` and knew you were here , for it was by hearing him tell the place that I found you out . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 10]: I never heard the name , ' said Rose .
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 23]: ` Then he goes by some other amongst us , ' rejoined the girl , ` which I more than thought before .
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 39]: Some time ago , and soon after Oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery , I -- suspecting this man -- listened to a conversation held between him and Fagin in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 36]: I found out , from what I heard , that Monks -- the man I asked you about , you know -- ' ` Yes , ' said Rose , ' I understand . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 51]: -- That Monks , ' pursued the girl , ` had seen him accidently with two of our boys on the day we first lost him , and had known him directly to be the same child that he was watching for , though I could n't make out why .
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 43]: A bargain was struck with Fagin , that if Oliver was got back he should have a certain sum ; and he was to have more for making him a thief , which this Monks wanted for some purpose of his own .
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 6]: ` For what purpose ? '
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 3]: asked Rose .
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 49]: ` He caught sight of my shadow on the wall as I listened , in the hope of finding out , ' said the girl ; ` and there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery .
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 15]: But I did ; and I saw him no more till last night . '
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 7]: ` And what occurred then ? '
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 8]: ` I 'll tell you , lady .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 6]: Last night he came again .
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 26]: Again they went upstairs , and I , wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray me , again listened at the door .
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 45]: The first words I heard Monks say were these : `` So the only proofs of the boy 's identity lie at the bottom of the river , and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin . ''
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 106]: They laughed , and talked of his success in doing this ; and Monks , talking on about the boy , and getting very wild , said that though he had got the young devil 's money safely know , he 'd rather have had it the other way ; for , what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the father 's will , by driving him through every jail in town , and then hauling him up for some capital felony which Fagin could easily manage , after having made a good profit of him besides . '
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 7]: ` What is all this ! '
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 3]: said Rose .
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 18]: ` The truth , lady , though it comes from my lips , ' replied the girl .
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 82]: ` Then , he said , with oaths common enough in my ears , but strange to yours , that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy 's life without bringing his own neck in danger , he would ; but , as he could n't , he 'd be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life ; and if he took advantage of his birth and history , he might harm him yet .
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 34]: `` In short , Fagin , '' he says , `` Jew as you are , you never laid such snares as I 'll contrive for my young brother , Oliver . '' '
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 5]: ` His brother ! '
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 3]: exclaimed Rose .
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 37]: ` Those were his words , ' said Nancy , glancing uneasily round , as she had scarcely ceased to do , since she began to speak , for a vision of Sikes haunted her perpetually .
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 4]: ` And more .
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 75]: When he spoke of you and the other lady , and said it seemed contrived by Heaven , or the devil , against him , that Oliver should come into your hands , he laughed , and said there was some comfort in that too , for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds would you not give , if you had them , to know who your two-legged spaniel was . '
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 26]: ` You do not mean , ' said Rose , turning very pale , ` to tell me that this was said in earnest ? '
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 24]: ` He spoke in hard and angry earnest , if a man ever did , ' replied the girl , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 12]: ` He is an earnest man when his hatred is up .
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 26]: I know many who do worse things ; but I 'd rather listen to them all a dozen times , than to that Monks once .
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 23]: It is growing late , and I have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this .
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 7]: I must get back quickly . '
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 8]: ` But what can I do ? '
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 3]: said Rose .
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 12]: ` To what use can I turn this communication without you ?
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 2]: Back !
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 15]: Why do you wish to return to companions you paint in such terrible colors ?
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 38]: If you repeat this information to a gentleman whom I can summon in an instant from the next room , you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an hour 's delay . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 12]: I wish to go back , ' said the girl . '
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 20]: I must go back , because -- how can I tell such things to an innocent lady like you ?
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 44]: -- because among the men I have told you of , there is one : the most desperate among them all ; that I ca n't leave : no , not even to be saved from the life I am leading now . '
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 70]: ` Your having interfered in this dear boy 's behalf before , ' said Rose ; ` your coming here , at so great a risk , to tell me what you have heard ; your manner , which convinces me of the truth of what you say ; your evident contrition , and sense of shame ; all lead me to believe that you might yet be reclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 3]: Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 56]: said the earnest girl , folding her hands as the tears coursed down her face , ` do not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of one of your own sex ; the first -- the first , I do believe , who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion .
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 17]: Do hear my words , and let me save you yet , for better things . '
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 69]: ` Lady , ' cried the girl , sinking on her knees , ` dear , sweet , angel lady , you ARE the first that ever blessed me with such words as these , and if I had heard them years ago , they might have turned me from a life of sin and sorrow ; but it is too late , it is too late ! '
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 18]: ` It is never too late , ' said Rose , ` for penitence and atonement . '
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 24]: ` It is , ' cried the girl , writhing in agony of her mind ; ' I can not leave him now !
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 8]: I could not be his death . '
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 7]: ` Why should you be ? '
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 3]: asked Rose .
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 11]: ` Nothing could save him , ' cried the girl .
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 25]: ` If I told others what I have told you , and led to their being taken , he would be sure to die .
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 12]: He is the boldest , and has been so cruel ! '
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 32]: ` Is it possible , ' cried Rose , ` that for such a man as this , you can resign every future hope , and the certainty of immediate rescue ?
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 6]: It is madness . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 40]: I do n't know what it is , ' answered the girl ; ' I only know that it is so , and not with me alone , but with hundreds of others as bad and wretched as myself .
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 5]: I must go back .
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 55]: Whether it is God 's wrath for the wrong I have done , I do not know ; but I am drawn back to him through every suffering and ill usage ; and I should be , I believe , if I knew that I was to die by his hand at last . '
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 8]: ` What am I to do ? '
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 4]: said Rose . '
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 11]: I should not let you depart from me thus . '
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 19]: ` You should , lady , and I know you will , ' rejoined the girl , rising .
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 29]: ` You will not stop my going because I have trusted in your goodness , and forced no promise from you , as I might have done . '
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 15]: ` Of what use , then , is the communication you have made ? '
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 3]: said Rose .
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 26]: ` This mystery must be investigated , or how will its disclosure to me , benefit Oliver , whom you are anxious to serve ? '
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 29]: ` You must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a secret , and advise you what to do , ' rejoined the girl .
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 14]: ` But where can I find you again when it is necessary ? '
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 4]: asked Rose . '
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 29]: I do not seek to know where these dreadful people live , but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time ? '
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 39]: ` Will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept , and come alone , or with the only other person that knows it ; and that I shall not be watched or followed ? '
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 5]: asked the girl . '
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 9]: I promise you solemnly , ' answered Rose .
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 33]: ` Every Sunday night , from eleven until the clock strikes twelve , ' said the girl without hesitation , ' I will walk on London Bridge if I am alive . '
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 18]: ` Stay another moment , ' interposed Rose , as the girl moved hurriedly towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 19]: ` Think once again on your own condition , and the opportunity you have of escaping from it .
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 26]: You have a claim on me : not only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence , but as a woman lost almost beyond redemption .
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 21]: Will you return to this gang of robbers , and to this man , when a word can save you ?
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 19]: What fascination is it that can take you back , and make you cling to wickedness and misery ?
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 12]: is there no chord in your heart that I can touch !
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 16]: Is there nothing left , to which I can appeal against this terrible infatuation ! '
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 54]: ` When ladies as young , and good , and beautiful as you are , ' replied the girl steadily , ` give away your hearts , love will carry you all lengths -- even such as you , who have home , friends , other admirers , everything , to fill them .
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 58]: When such as I , who have no certain roof but the coffinlid , and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse , set our rotten hearts on any man , and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives , who can hope to cure us ?
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 45]: Pity us , lady -- pity us for having only one feeling of the woman left , and for having that turned , by a heavy judgment , from a comfort and a pride , into a new means of violence and suffering . '
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 37]: ` You will , ' said Rose , after a pause , ` take some money from me , which may enable you to live without dishonesty -- at all events until we meet again ? '
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 14]: ` Not a penny , ' replied the girl , waving her hand .
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 23]: ` Do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you , ' said Rose , stepping gently forward . '
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 8]: I wish to serve you indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 66]: ` You would serve me best , lady , ' replied the girl , wringing her hands , ` if you could take my life at once ; for I have felt more grief to think of what I am , to-night , than I ever did before , and it would be something not to die in the hell in which I have lived .
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 24]: God bless you , sweet lady , and send as much happiness on your head as I have brought shame on mine ! '
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 50]: Thus speaking , and sobbing aloud , the unhappy creature turned away ; while Rose Maylie , overpowered by this extraordinary interview , which had more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurance , sank into a chair , and endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 31]: CHAPTER XLI CONTAINING FRESH DISCOVERIES , AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES , LIKE MISFORTUNES , SELDOM COME ALONE Her situation was , indeed , one of no common trial and difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 52]: While she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in which Oliver 's history was enveloped , she could not but hold sacred the confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed , had reposed in her , as a young and guileless girl .
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 46]: Her words and manner had touched Rose Maylie 's heart ; and , mingled with her love for her young charge , and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour , was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope .
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 23]: They purposed remaining in London only three days , prior to departing for some weeks to a distant part of the coast .
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 9]: It was now midnight of the first day .
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 17]: What course of action could she determine upon , which could be adopted in eight-and-forty hours ?
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 11]: Or how could she postpone the journey without exciting suspicion ?
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 78]: Mr. Losberne was with them , and would be for the next two days ; but Rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman 's impetuosity , and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which , in the first explosion of his indignation , he would regard the instrument of Oliver 's recapture , to trust him with the secret , when her representations in the girl 's behalf could be seconded by no experienced person .
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 37]: These were all reasons for the greatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to Mrs. Maylie , whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy doctor on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 31]: As to resorting to any legal adviser , even if she had known how to do so , it was scarcely to be thought of , for the same reason .
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 66]: Once the thought occurred to her of seeking assistance from Harry ; but this awakened the recollection of their last parting , and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back , when -- the tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflection -- he might have by this time learnt to forget her , and to be happier away .
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 40]: Disturbed by these different reflections ; inclining now to one course and then to another , and again recoiling from all , as each successive consideration presented itself to her mind ; Rose passed a sleepless and anxious night .
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 18]: After more communing with herself next day , she arrived at the desperate conclusion of consulting Harry .
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 26]: ` If it be painful to him , ' she thought , ` to come back here , how painful it will be to me !
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 31]: But perhaps he will not come ; he may write , or he may come himself , and studiously abstain from meeting me -- he did when he went away .
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 15]: I hardly thought he would ; but it was better for us both . '
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 28]: And here Rose dropped the pen , and turned away , as though the very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep .
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 72]: She had taken up the same pen , and laid it down again fifty times , and had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without writing the first word , when Oliver , who had been walking in the streets , with Mr. Giles for a body-guard , entered the room in such breathless haste and violent agitation , as seemed to betoken some new cause of alarm .
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 9]: ` What makes you look so flurried ? '
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 9]: asked Rose , advancing to meet him . '
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 19]: I hardly know how ; I feel as if I should be choked , ' replied the boy .
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 4]: ` Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 27]: To think that I should see him at last , and you should be able to know that I have told you the truth ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 19]: I never thought you had told us anything but the truth , ' said Rose , soothing him .
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 6]: ` But what is this ?
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 9]: -- of whom do you speak ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 37]: I have seen the gentleman , ' replied Oliver , scarcely able to articulate , ` the gentleman who was so good to me -- Mr. Brownlow , that we have so often talked about . '
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 4]: ` Where ? '
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 3]: asked Rose .
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 23]: ` Getting out of a coach , ' replied Oliver , shedding tears of delight , ` and going into a house .
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 37]: I did n't speak to him -- I could n't speak to him , for he did n't see me , and I trembled so , that I was not able to go up to him .
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 18]: But Giles asked , for me , whether he lived there , and they said he did .
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 30]: Look here , ' said Oliver , opening a scrap of paper , ` here it is ; here 's where he lives -- I 'm going there directly !
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 8]: Oh , dear me , dear me !
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 17]: What shall I do when I come to see him and hear him speak again ! '
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 33]: With her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many other incoherent exclamations of joy , Rose read the address , which was Craven Street , in the Strand .
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 11]: She very soon determined upon turning the discovery to account .
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 4]: ` Quick ! '
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 16]: ` Tell them to fetch a hackney-coach , and be ready to go with me .
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 15]: I will take you there directly , without a minute 's loss of time .
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 25]: I will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour , and be ready as soon as you are . '
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 23]: Oliver needed no prompting to despatch , and in little more than five minutes they were on their way to Craven Street .
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 42]: When they arrived there , Rose left Oliver in the coach , under pretence of preparing the old gentleman to receive him ; and sending up her card by the servant , requested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business .
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 38]: The servant soon returned , to beg that she would walk upstairs ; and following him into an upper room , Miss Maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman of benevolent appearance , in a bottle-green coat .
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 48]: At no great distance from whom , was seated another old gentleman , in nankeen breeches and gaiters ; who did not look particularly benevolent , and who was sitting with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick , and his chin propped thereupon .
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 45]: ` Dear me , ' said the gentleman , in the bottle-green coat , hastily rising with great politeness , ' I beg your pardon , young lady -- I imagined it was some importunate person who -- I beg you will excuse me .
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 6]: Be seated , pray . '
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 10]: ` Mr. Brownlow , I believe , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 15]: said Rose , glancing from the other gentleman to the one who had spoken .
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 12]: ` That is my name , ' said the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 9]: ` This is my friend , Mr. Grimwig .
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 13]: Grimwig , will you leave us for a few minutes ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 29]: I believe , ' interposed Miss Maylie , ` that at this period of our interview , I need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away .
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 22]: If I am correctly informed , he is cognizant of the business on which I wish to speak to you . '
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 6]: Mr. Brownlow inclined his head .
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 30]: Mr. Grimwig , who had made one very stiff bow , and risen from his chair , made another very stiff bow , and dropped into it again . '
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 53]: I shall surprise you very much , I have no doubt , ' said Rose , naturally embarrassed ; ` but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a very dear young friend of mine , and I am sure you will take an interest in hearing of him again . '
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 4]: ` Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 4]: said Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 12]: ` Oliver Twist you knew him as , ' replied Rose .
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 129]: The words no sooner escaped her lips , than Mr. Grimwig , who had been affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table , upset it with a great crash , and falling back in his chair , discharged from his features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder , and indulged in a prolonged and vacant stare ; then , as if ashamed of having betrayed so much emotion , he jerked himself , as it were , by a convulsion into his former attitude , and looking out straight before him emitted a long deep whistle , which seemed , at last , not to be discharged on empty air , but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach .
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 19]: Mr. Browlow was no less surprised , although his astonishment was not expressed in the same eccentric manner .
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 90]: He drew his chair nearer to Miss Maylie 's , and said , ` Do me the favour , my dear young lady , to leave entirely out of the question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak , and of which nobody else knows anything ; and if you have it in your power to produce any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion I was once induced to entertain of that poor child , in Heaven 's name put me in possession of it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 4]: A bad one !
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 32]: I 'll eat my head if he is not a bad one , ' growled Mr. Grimwig , speaking by some ventriloquial power , without moving a muscle of his face .
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 59]: ` He is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart , ' said Rose , colouring ; ` and that Power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years , has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over . '
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 17]: ` I 'm only sixty-one , ' said Mr. Grimwig , with the same rigid face .
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 31]: ` And , as the devil 's in it if this Oliver is not twelve years old at least , I do n't see the application of that remark . '
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 25]: ` Do not heed my friend , Miss Maylie , ' said Mr. Brownlow ; ` he does not mean what he says . '
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 11]: ` Yes , he does , ' growled Mr. Grimwig .
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 20]: ` No , he does not , ' said Mr. Brownlow , obviously rising in wrath as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 17]: ` He 'll eat his head , if he does n't , ' growled Mr. Grimwig .
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 19]: ` He would deserve to have it knocked off , if he does , ' said Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 27]: ` And he 'd uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it , ' responded Mr. Grimwig , knocking his stick upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 24]: Having gone thus far , the two old gentlemen severally took snuff , and afterwards shook hands , according to their invariable custom .
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 26]: ` Now , Miss Maylie , ' said Mr. Brownlow , ` to return to the subject in which your humanity is so much interested .
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 69]: Will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor child : allowing me to promise that I exhausted every means in my power of discovering him , and that since I have been absent from this country , my first impression that he had imposed upon me , and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob me , has been considerably shaken . '
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 74]: Rose , who had had time to collect her thoughts , at once related , in a few natural words , all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr. Brownlow 's house ; reserving Nancy 's information for that gentleman 's private ear , and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow , for some months past , had been not being able to meet with his former benefactor and friend .
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 5]: ` Thank God ! '
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 5]: said the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 11]: ` This is great happiness to me , great happiness .
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 14]: But you have not told me where he is now , Miss Maylie .
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 18]: You must pardon my finding fault with you , -- but why not have brought him ? '
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 15]: ` He is waiting in a coach at the door , ' replied Rose .
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 6]: ` At this door ! '
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 5]: cried the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 26]: With which he hurried out of the room , down the stairs , up the coachsteps , and into the coach , without another word .
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 49]: When the room-door closed behind him , Mr. Grimwig lifted up his head , and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot , described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and the table ; stitting in it all the time .
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 39]: After performing this evolution , he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room at least a dozen times , and then stopping suddenly before Rose , kissed her without the slightest preface .
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 16]: he said , as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual proceeding .
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 6]: ` Do n't be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 9]: I 'm old enough to be your grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 6]: You 're a sweet girl .
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 4]: I like you .
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 5]: Here they are ! '
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 62]: In fact , as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former seat , Mr. Brownlow returned , accompanied by Oliver , whom Mr. Grimwig received very graciously ; and if the gratification of that moment had been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in Oliver 's behalf , Rose Maylie would have been well repaid .
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 24]: ` There is somebody else who should not be forgotten , by the bye , ' said Mr. Brownlow , ringing the bell .
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 11]: ` Send Mrs. Bedwin here , if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 22]: The old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch ; and dropping a curtsey at the door , waited for orders .
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 19]: ` Why , you get blinder every day , Bedwin , ' said Mr. Brownlow , rather testily .
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 15]: ` Well , that I do , sir , ' replied the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 21]: ` People 's eyes , at my time of life , do n't improve with age , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 37]: I could have told you that , ' rejoined Mr. Brownlow ; ` but put on your glasses , and see if you ca n't find out what you were wanted for , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 13]: The old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 25]: But Oliver 's patience was not proof against this new trial ; and yielding to his first impulse , he sprang into her arms .
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 8]: ` God be good to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 16]: cried the old lady , embracing him ; ` it is my innocent boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 7]: ` My dear old nurse ! '
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 3]: cried Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 23]: ` He would come back -- I knew he would , ' said the old lady , holding him in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 18]: ` How well he looks , and how like a gentleman 's son he is dressed again !
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 11]: Where have you been , this long , long while ?
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 20]: the same sweet face , but not so pale ; the same soft eye , but not so sad .
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 40]: I have never forgotten them or his quiet smile , but have seen them every day , side by side with those of my own dear children , dead and gone since I was a lightsome young creature . '
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 43]: Running on thus , and now holding Oliver from her to mark how he had grown , now clasping him to her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair , the good soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns .
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 43]: Leaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure , Mr. Brownlow led the way into another room ; and there , heard from Rose a full narration of her interview with Nancy , which occasioned him no little surprise and perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 18]: Rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in her friend Mr. Losberne in the first instance .
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 23]: The old gentleman considered that she had acted prudently , and readily undertook to hold solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself .
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 46]: To afford him an early opportunity for the execution of this design , it was arranged that he should call at the hotel at eight o'clock that evening , and that in the meantime Mrs. Maylie should be cautiously informed of all that had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 10]: These preliminaries adjusted , Rose and Oliver returned home .
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 15]: Rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor 's wrath .
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 57]: Nancy 's history was no sooner unfolded to him , than he poured forth a shower of mingled threats and execrations ; threatened to make her the first victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blathers and Duff ; and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the assistance of those worthies .
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 74]: And , doubtless , he would , in this first outbreak , have carried the intention into effect without a moment 's consideration of the consequences , if he had not been restrained , in part , by corresponding violence on the side of Mr. Brownlow , who was himself of an irascible temperament , and party by such arguments and representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his hotbrained purpose .
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 11]: ` Then what the devil is to be done ? '
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 13]: said the impetuous doctor , when they had rejoined the two ladies .
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 51]: ` Are we to pass a vote of thanks to all these vagabonds , male and female , and beg them to accept a hundred pounds , or so , apiece , as a trifling mark of our esteem , and some slight acknowledgment of their kindness to Oliver ? '
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 24]: ` Not exactly that , ' rejoined Mr. Brownlow , laughing ; ` but we must proceed gently and with great care . '
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 10]: ` Gentleness and care , ' exclaimed the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 21]: ` I 'd send them one and all to -- ' ` Never mind where , ' interposed Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 19]: ` But reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view . '
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 5]: ` What object ? '
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 4]: asked the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 32]: ` Simply , the discovery of Oliver 's parentage , and regaining for him the inheritance of which , if this story be true , he has been fraudulently deprived . '
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 17]: said Mr. Losberne , cooling himself with his pocket-handkerchief ; ' I almost forgot that . '
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 44]: ` You see , ' pursued Mr. Brownlow ; ` placing this poor girl entirely out of the question , and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety , what good should we bring about ? '
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 25]: ` Hanging a few of them at least , in all probability , ' suggested the doctor , ` and transporting the rest . '
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 73]: ` Very good , ' replied Mr. Brownlow , smiling ; ` but no doubt they will bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time , and if we step in to forestall them , it seems to me that we shall be performing a very Quixotic act , in direct opposition to our own interest -- or at least to Oliver 's , which is the same thing . '
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 4]: ` How ? '
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 4]: inquired the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 3]: ` Thus .
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 32]: It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery , unless we can bring this man , Monks , upon his knees .
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 21]: That can only be done by stratagem , and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these people .
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 14]: For , suppose he were apprehended , we have no proof against him .
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 29]: He is not even -LRB- so far as we know , or as the facts appear to us -RRB- concerned with the gang in any of their robberies .
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 62]: If he were not discharged , it is very unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond ; and of course ever afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as well , for our purposes , be deaf , dumb , blind , and an idiot . '
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 75]: ` Then , ' said the doctor impetuously , ' I put it to you again , whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered binding ; a promise made with the best and kindest intentions , but really -- ' ` Do not discuss the point , my dear young lady , pray , ' said Mr. Brownlow , interrupting Rose as she was about to speak .
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 7]: ` The promise shall be kept .
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 17]: I do n't think it will , in the slightest degree , interfere with our proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 90]: But , before we can resolve upon any precise course of action , it will be necessary to see the girl ; to ascertain from her whether she will point out this Monks , on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us , and not by the law ; or , if she will not , or can not do that , to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person , as will enable us to identify him .
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 14]: She can not be seen until next Sunday night ; this is Tuesday .
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 24]: I would suggest that in the meantime , we remain perfectly quiet , and keep these matters secret even from Oliver himself . '
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 56]: Although Mr. Loseberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving a delay of five whole days , he was fain to admit that no better course occurred to him just then ; and as both Rose and Mrs. Maylie sided very strongly with Mr. Brownlow , that gentleman 's proposition was carried unanimously . '
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 19]: I should like , ' he said , ` to call in the aid of my friend Grimwig .
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 68]: He is a strange creature , but a shrewd one , and might prove of material assistance to us ; I should say that he was bred a lawyer , and quitted the Bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course , in twenty years , though whether that is recommendation or not , you must determine for yourselves . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 22]: I have no objection to your calling in your friend if I may call in mine , ' said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 21]: ` We must put it to the vote , ' replied Mr. Brownlow , ` who may he be ? '
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 36]: ` That lady 's son , and this young lady 's -- very old friend , ' said the doctor , motioning towards Mrs. Maylie , and concluding with an expressive glance at her niece .
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 38]: Rose blushed deeply , but she did not make any audible objection to this motion -LRB- possibly she felt in a hopeless minority -RRB- ; and Harry Maylie and Mr. Grimwig were accordingly added to the committee .
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 31]: ` We stay in town , of course , ' said Mrs. Maylie , ` while there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success .
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 48]: I will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested , and I am content to remain here , if it be for twelve months , so long as you assure me that any hope remains . '
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 4]: ` Good ! '
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 4]: rejoined Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 67]: ` And as I see on the faces about me , a disposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in the way to corroborate Oliver 's tale , and had so suddenly left the kingdom , let me stipulate that I shall be asked no questions until such time as I may deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story .
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 34]: Believe me , I make this request with good reason , for I might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realised , and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite numerous enough .
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 51]: Supper has been announced , and young Oliver , who is all alone in the next room , will have begun to think , by this time , that we have wearied of his company , and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world . '
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 21]: With these words , the old gentleman gave his hand to Mrs. Maylie , and escorted her into the supper-room .
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 20]: Mr. Losberne followed , leading Rose ; and the council was , for the present , effectually broken up .
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 71]: CHAPTER XLII AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVER 'S , EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF GENIUS , BECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLIS Upon the night when Nancy , having lulled Mr. Sikes to sleep , hurried on her self-imposed mission to Rose Maylie , there advanced towards London , by the Great North Road , two persons , upon whom it is expedient that this history should bestow some attention .
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 74]: They were a man and woman ; or perhaps they would be better described as a male and female : for the former was one of those long-limbed , knock-kneed , shambling , bony people , to whom it is difficult to assign any precise age , -- looking as they do , when they are yet boys , like undergrown men , and when they are almost men , like overgrown boys .
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 33]: The woman was young , but of a robust and hardy make , as she need have been to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back .
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 37]: Her companion was not encumbered with much luggage , as there merely dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder , a small parcel wrapped in a common handkerchief , and apparently light enough .
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 59]: This circumstance , added to the length of his legs , which were of unusual extent , enabled him with much ease to keep some half-dozen paces in advance of his companion , to whom he occasionally turned with an impatient jerk of the head : as if reproaching her tardiness , and urging her to greater exertion .
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 66]: Thus , they had toiled along the dusty road , taking little heed of any object within sight , save when they stepped aside to allow a wider passage for the mail-coaches which were whirling out of town , until they passed through Highgate archway ; when the foremost traveller stopped and called impatiently to his companion , ` Come on , ca n't yer ?
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 9]: What a lazybones yer are , Charlotte . '
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 25]: ` It 's a heavy load , I can tell you , ' said the female , coming up , almost breathless with fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 3]: ` Heavy !
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 6]: What are yer talking about ?
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 7]: What are yer made for ? '
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 19]: rejoined the male traveller , changing his own little bundle as he spoke , to the other shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 10]: ` Oh , there yer are , resting again !
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 22]: Well , if yer ai n't enough to tire anybody 's patience out , I do n't know what is ! '
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 7]: ` Is it much farther ? '
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 21]: asked the woman , resting herself against a bank , and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face .
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 4]: ` Much farther !
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 17]: Yer as good as there , ' said the long-legged tramper , pointing out before him .
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 4]: ` Look there !
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 8]: Those are the lights of London . '
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 18]: ` They 're a good two mile off , at least , ' said the woman despondingly .
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 45]: ` Never mind whether they 're two mile off , or twenty , ' said Noah Claypole ; for he it was ; ` but get up and come on , or I 'll kick yer , and so I give yer notice . '
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 45]: As Noah 's red nose grew redder with anger , and as he crossed the road while speaking , as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution , the woman rose without any further remark , and trudged onward by his side .
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 14]: ` Where do you mean to stop for the night , Noah ? '
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 12]: she asked , after they had walked a few hundred yards .
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 7]: ` How should I know ? '
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 12]: replied Noah , whose temper had been considerably impaired by walking .
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 10]: ` Near , I hope , ' said Charlotte .
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 11]: ` No , not near , ' replied Mr. Claypole .
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 3]: ` There !
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 10]: Not near ; so do n't think it . '
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 5]: ` Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 33]: ` When I tell yer that I do n't mean to do a thing , that 's enough , without any why or because either , ' replied Mr. Claypole with dignity .
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 16]: ` Well , you need n't be so cross , ' said his companion . '
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 62]: A pretty thing it would be , would n't it to go and stop at the very first public-house outside the town , so that Sowerberry , if he come up after us , might poke in his old nose , and have us taken back in a cart with handcuffs on , ' said Mr. Claypole in a jeering tone .
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 3]: ` No !
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 31]: I shall go and lose myself among the narrowest streets I can find , and not stop till we come to the very out-of-the-wayest house I can set eyes on .
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 52]: ` Cod , yer may thanks yer stars I 've got a head ; for if we had n't gone , at first , the wrong road a purpose , and come back across country , yer 'd have been locked up hard and fast a week ago , my lady .
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 11]: And serve yer right for being a fool . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 35]: I know I ai n't as cunning as you are , ' replied Charlotte ; ` but do n't put all the blame on me , and say I should have been locked up .
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 13]: You would have been if I had been , any way . '
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 20]: ` Yer took the money from the till , yer know yer did , ' said Mr. Claypole . '
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 14]: I took it for you , Noah , dear , ' rejoined Charlotte .
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 7]: ` Did I keep it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 4]: asked Mr. Claypole .
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 40]: ` No ; you trusted in me , and let me carry it like a dear , and so you are , ' said the lady , chucking him under the chin , and drawing her arm through his .
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 85]: This was indeed the case ; but as it was not Mr. Claypole 's habit to repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody , it should be observed , in justice to that gentleman , that he had trusted Charlotte to this extent , in order that , if they were pursued , the money might be found on her : which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his innocence of any theft , and would greatly facilitate his chances of escape .
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 24]: Of course , he entered at this juncture , into no explanation of his motives , and they walked on very lovingly together .
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 45]: In pursuance of this cautious plan , Mr. Claypole went on , without halting , until he arrived at the Angel at Islington , where he wisely judged , from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles , that London began in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 74]: Just pausing to observe which appeared the most crowded streets , and consequently the most to be avoided , he crossed into Saint John 's Road , and was soon deep in the obscurity of the intricate and dirty ways , which , lying between Gray 's Inn Lane and Smithfield , render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst that improvement has left in the midst of London .
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 52]: Through these streets , Noah Claypole walked , dragging Charlotte after him ; now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole external character of some small public-house ; now jogging on again , as some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his purpose .
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 50]: At length , he stopped in front of one , more humble in appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen ; and , having crossed over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement , graciously announced his intention of putting up there , for the night .
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 39]: ` So give us the bundle , ' said Noah , unstrapping it from the woman 's shoulders , and slinging it over his own ; ` and do n't yer speak , except when yer spoke to .
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 14]: What 's the name of the house -- t-h-r -- three what ? '
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 7]: ` Cripples , ' said Charlotte .
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 16]: ` Three Cripples , ' repeated Noah , ` and a very good sign too .
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 4]: Now , then !
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 11]: Keep close at my heels , and come along . '
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 23]: With these injunctions , he pushed the rattling door with his shoulder , and entered the house , followed by his companion .
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 27]: There was nobody in the bar but a young Jew , who , with his two elbows on the counter , was reading a dirty newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 15]: He stared very hard at Noah , and Noah stared very hard at him .
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 61]: If Noah had been attired in his charity-boy 's dress , there might have been some reason for the Jew opening his eyes so wide ; but as he had discarded the coat and badge , and wore a short smock-frock over his leathers , there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting so much attention in a public-house .
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 8]: ` Is this the Three Cripples ? '
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 3]: asked Noah .
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 16]: ` That is the dabe of this ` ouse , ' replied the Jew . '
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 49]: A gentleman we met on the road , coming up from the country , recommended us here , ' said Noah , nudging Charlotte , perhaps to call her attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect , and perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise .
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 9]: ` We want to sleep here to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 26]: ` I ' b dot certaid you cad , ' said Barney , who was the attendant sprite ; ` but I 'll idquire . '
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 27]: ` Show us the tap , and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer while yer inquiring , will yer ? '
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 3]: said Noah .
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 43]: Barney complied by ushering them into a small back-room , and setting the required viands before them ; having done which , he informed the travellers that they could be lodged that night , and left the amiable couple to their refreshment .
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 117]: Now , this back-room was immediately behind the bar , and some steps lower , so that any person connected with the house , undrawing a small curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the last-named apartment , about five feet from its flooring , could not only look down upon any guests in the back-room without any great hazard of being observed -LRB- the glass being in a dark angle of the wall , between which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself -RRB- , but could , by applying his ear to the partition , ascertain with tolerable distinctness , their subject of conversation .
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 57]: The landlord of the house had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes , and Barney had only just returned from making the communication above related , when Fagin , in the course of his evening 's business , came into the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils .
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 11]: said Barney : ` stradegers id the next roob . '
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 4]: ` Strangers ! '
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 8]: repeated the old man in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 9]: Ad rub uds too , ' added Barney .
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 18]: ` Frob the cuttry , but subthig in your way , or I ' b bistaked . '
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 10]: Fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest .
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 58]: Mounting a stool , he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass , from which secret post he could see Mr. Claypole taking cold beef from the dish , and porter from the pot , and administering homoepathic doses of both to Charlotte , who sat patiently by , eating and drinking at his pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 4]: ` Aha ! '
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 16]: he whispered , looking round to Barney , ' I like that fellow 's looks .
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 17]: He 'd be of use to us ; he knows how to train the girl already .
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 26]: Do n't make as much noise as a mouse , my dear , and let me hear 'em talk -- let me hear 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 39]: He again applied his eye to the glass , and turning his ear to the partition , listened attentively : with a subtle and eager look upon his face , that might have appertained to some old goblin .
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 36]: ` So I mean to be a gentleman , ' said Mr. Claypole , kicking out his legs , and continuing a conversation , the commencement of which Fagin had arrived too late to hear .
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 31]: ` No more jolly old coffins , Charlotte , but a gentleman 's life for me : and , if yer like , yer shall be a lady . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 34]: I should like that well enough , dear , ' replied Charlotte ; ` but tills ai n't to be emptied every day , and people to get clear off after it . '
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 6]: 'Till s be blowed ! '
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 16]: said Mr. Claypole ; ` there 's more things besides tills to be emptied . '
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 4]: asked his companion .
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 14]: ` Pockets , women 's ridicules , houses , mail-coaches , banks ! '
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 9]: said Mr. Claypole , rising with the porter .
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 16]: ` But you ca n't do all that , dear , ' said Charlotte . '
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 17]: I shall look out to get into company with them as can , ' replied Noah .
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 14]: ` They 'll be able to make us useful some way or another .
Parsing [sent. 7017 len. 29]: Why , you yourself are worth fifty women ; I never see such a precious sly and deceitful creetur as yer can be when I let yer . '
Parsing [sent. 7018 len. 14]: ` Lor , how nice it is to hear yer say so ! '
Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 11]: exclaimed Charlotte , imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face .
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 33]: ` There , that 'll do : do n't yer be too affectionate , in case I 'm cross with yer , ' said Noah , disengaging himself with great gravity . '
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 27]: I should like to be the captain of some band , and have the whopping of 'em , and follering 'em about , unbeknown to themselves .
Parsing [sent. 7022 len. 57]: That would suit me , if there was good profit ; and if we could only get in with some gentleman of this sort , I say it would be cheap at that twenty-pound note you 've got , -- especially as we do n't very well know how to get rid of it ourselves . '
Parsing [sent. 7023 len. 41]: After expressing this opinion , Mr. Claypole looked into the porter-pot with an aspect of deep wisdom ; and having well shaken its contents , nodded condescendingly to Charlotte , and took a draught , wherewith he appeared greatly refreshed .
Parsing [sent. 7024 len. 23]: He was meditating another , when the sudden opening of the door , and the appearance of a stranger , interrupted him .
Parsing [sent. 7025 len. 6]: The stranger was Mr. Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 37]: And very amiable he looked , and a very low bow he made , as he advanced , and setting himself down at the nearest table , ordered something to drink of the grinning Barney . '
Parsing [sent. 7027 len. 22]: A pleasant night , sir , but cool for the time of year , ' said Fagin , rubbing his hands .
Parsing [sent. 7028 len. 11]: ` From the country , I see , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 7029 len. 8]: ` How do yer see that ? '
Parsing [sent. 7030 len. 4]: asked Noah Claypole .
Parsing [sent. 7031 len. 35]: ` We have not so much dust as that in London , ' replied Fagin , pointing from Noah 's shoes to those of his companion , and from them to the two bundles .
Parsing [sent. 7032 len. 10]: ` Yer a sharp feller , ' said Noah .
Parsing [sent. 7033 len. 3]: ` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 7034 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 7035 len. 7]: only hear that , Charlotte ! '
Parsing [sent. 7036 len. 35]: ` Why , one need be sharp in this town , my dear , ' replied the Jew , sinking his voice to a confidential whisper ; ` and that 's the truth . '
Parsing [sent. 7037 len. 46]: Fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his right forefinger , -- a gesture which Noah attempted to imitate , though not with complete success , in consequence of his own nose not being large enough for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 7038 len. 34]: However , Mr. Fagin seemed to interpret the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion , and put about the liquor which Barney reappeared with , in a very friendly manner .
Parsing [sent. 7039 len. 14]: ` Good stuff that , ' observed Mr. Claypole , smacking his lips .
Parsing [sent. 7040 len. 4]: ` Dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 7041 len. 4]: said Fagin . '
Parsing [sent. 7042 len. 38]: A man need be always emptying a till , or a pocket , or a woman 's reticule , or a house , or a mail-coach , or a bank , if he drinks it regularly . '
Parsing [sent. 7043 len. 36]: Mr. Claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he fell back in his chair , and looked from the Jew to Charlotte with a countenance of ashy palences and excessive terror .
Parsing [sent. 7044 len. 18]: ` Do n't mind me , my dear , ' said Fagin , drawing his chair closer .
Parsing [sent. 7045 len. 3]: ` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 7046 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 7047 len. 13]: it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance .
Parsing [sent. 7048 len. 11]: It was very lucky it was only me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7049 len. 55]: I did n't take it , ' stammered Noah , no longer stretching out his legs like an independent gentleman , but coiling them up as well as he could under his chair ; ` it was all her doing ; yer 've got it now , Charlotte , yer know yer have . '
Parsing [sent. 7050 len. 37]: ` No matter who 's got it , or who did it , my dear , ' replied Fagin , glancing , nevertheless , with a hawk 's eye at the girl and the two bundles .
Parsing [sent. 7051 len. 16]: ` I 'm in that way myself , and I like you for it . '
Parsing [sent. 7052 len. 6]: ` In what way ? '
Parsing [sent. 7053 len. 8]: asked Mr. Claypole , a little recovering .
Parsing [sent. 7054 len. 21]: ` In that way of business , ' rejoined Fagin ; ` and so are the people of the house .
Parsing [sent. 7055 len. 20]: You 've hit the right nail upon the head , and are as safe here as you could be .
Parsing [sent. 7056 len. 26]: There is not a safer place in all this town than is the Cripples ; that is , when I like to make it so .
Parsing [sent. 7057 len. 29]: And I have taken a fancy to you and the young woman ; so I 've said the word , and you may make your minds easy . '
Parsing [sent. 7058 len. 43]: Noah Claypole 's mind might have been at ease after this assurance , but his body certainly was not ; for he shuffled and writhed about , into various uncouth positions : eyeing his new friend meanwhile with mingled fear and suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 7059 len. 28]: ` I 'll tell you more , ' said Fagin , after he had reassured the girl , by dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements . '
Parsing [sent. 7060 len. 48]: I have got a friend that I think can gratify your darling wish , and put you in the right way , where you can take whatever department of the business you think will suit you best at first , and be taught all the others . '
Parsing [sent. 7061 len. 14]: ` Yer speak as if yer were in earnest , ' replied Noah .
Parsing [sent. 7062 len. 14]: ` What advantage would it be to me to be anything else ? '
Parsing [sent. 7063 len. 7]: inquired Fagin , shrugging his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 7064 len. 3]: ` Here !
Parsing [sent. 7065 len. 10]: Let me have a word with you outside . '
Parsing [sent. 7066 len. 24]: ` There 's no occasion to trouble ourselves to move , ' said Noah , getting his legs by gradual degrees abroad again .
Parsing [sent. 7067 len. 10]: ` She 'll take the luggage upstairs the while .
Parsing [sent. 7068 len. 8]: Charlotte , see to them bundles . '
Parsing [sent. 7069 len. 41]: This mandate , which had been delivered with great majesty , was obeyed without the slightest demur ; and Charlotte made the best of her way off with the packages while Noah held the door open and watched her out .
Parsing [sent. 7070 len. 13]: ` She 's kept tolerably well under , ai n't she ? '
Parsing [sent. 7071 len. 21]: he asked as he resumed his seat : in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal .
Parsing [sent. 7072 len. 14]: ` Quite perfect , ' rejoined Fagin , clapping him on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 7073 len. 10]: ` You 're a genius , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 7074 len. 20]: ` Why , I suppose if I was n't , I should n't be here , ' replied Noah .
Parsing [sent. 7075 len. 16]: ` But , I say , she 'll be back if yer lose time . '
Parsing [sent. 7076 len. 9]: ` Now , what do you think ? '
Parsing [sent. 7077 len. 3]: said Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7078 len. 18]: ` If you was to like my friend , could you do better than join him ? '
Parsing [sent. 7079 len. 17]: ` Is he in a good way of business ; that 's where it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 7080 len. 10]: responded Noah , winking one of his little eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7081 len. 23]: ` The top of the tree ; employs a power of hands ; has the very best society in the profession . '
Parsing [sent. 7082 len. 5]: ` Regular town-maders ? '
Parsing [sent. 7083 len. 4]: asked Mr. Claypole .
Parsing [sent. 7084 len. 38]: ` Not a countryman among 'em ; and I do n't think he 'd take you , even on my recommendation , if he did n't run rather short of assistants just now , ' replied Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7085 len. 9]: ` Should I have to hand over ? '
Parsing [sent. 7086 len. 7]: said Noah , slapping his breeches-pocket .
Parsing [sent. 7087 len. 19]: ` It could n't possibly be done without , ' replied Fagin , in a most decided manner .
Parsing [sent. 7088 len. 14]: ` Twenty pound , though -- it 's a lot of money ! '
Parsing [sent. 7089 len. 19]: ` Not when it 's in a note you ca n't get rid of , ' retorted Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7090 len. 9]: ` Number and date taken , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 7091 len. 6]: Payment stopped at the Bank ?
Parsing [sent. 7092 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7093 len. 8]: It 's not worth much to him .
Parsing [sent. 7094 len. 22]: It 'll have to go abroad , and he could n't sell it for a great deal in the market . '
Parsing [sent. 7095 len. 8]: ` When could I see him ? '
Parsing [sent. 7096 len. 4]: asked Noah doubtfully .
Parsing [sent. 7097 len. 5]: ` To-morrow morning . '
Parsing [sent. 7098 len. 4]: ` Where ? '
Parsing [sent. 7099 len. 4]: ` Here . '
Parsing [sent. 7100 len. 4]: ` Um ! '
Parsing [sent. 7101 len. 3]: said Noah .
Parsing [sent. 7102 len. 7]: ` What 's the wages ? '
Parsing [sent. 7103 len. 35]: ` Live like a gentleman -- board and lodging , pipes and spirits free -- half of all you earn , and half of all the young woman earns , ' replied Mr. Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7104 len. 87]: Whether Noah Claypole , whose rapacity was none of the least comprehensive , would have acceded even to these glowing terms , had he been a perfectly free agent , is very doubtful ; but as he recollected that , in the event of his refusal , it was in the power of his new acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately -LRB- and more unlikely things had come to pass -RRB- , he gradually relented , and said he thought that would suit him .
Parsing [sent. 7105 len. 33]: ` But , yer see , ' observed Noah , ` as she will be able to do a good deal , I should like to take something very light . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7106 len. 6]: A little fancy work ? '
Parsing [sent. 7107 len. 3]: suggested Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7108 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7109 len. 9]: something of that sort , ' replied Noah .
Parsing [sent. 7110 len. 10]: ` What do you think would suit me now ?
Parsing [sent. 7111 len. 16]: Something not too trying for the strength , and not very dangerous , you know .
Parsing [sent. 7112 len. 9]: That 's the sort of thing ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7113 len. 21]: I heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others , my dear , ' said Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7114 len. 15]: ` My friend wants somebody who would do that well , very much . '
Parsing [sent. 7115 len. 39]: ` Why , I did mention that , and I should n't mind turning my hand to it sometimes , ' rejoined Mr. Claypole slowly ; ` but it would n't pay by itself , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 7116 len. 6]: ` That 's true ! '
Parsing [sent. 7117 len. 10]: observed the Jew , ruminating or pretending to ruminate .
Parsing [sent. 7118 len. 8]: ` No , it might not . '
Parsing [sent. 7119 len. 9]: ` What do you think , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 7120 len. 7]: asked Noah , anxiously regarding him .
Parsing [sent. 7121 len. 25]: ` Something in the sneaking way , where it was pretty sure work , and not much more risk than being at home . '
Parsing [sent. 7122 len. 11]: ` What do you think of the old ladies ? '
Parsing [sent. 7123 len. 3]: asked Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7124 len. 23]: ` There 's a good deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels , and running round the corner . '
Parsing [sent. 7125 len. 15]: ` Do n't they holler out a good deal , and scratch sometimes ? '
Parsing [sent. 7126 len. 8]: asked Noah , shaking his head . '
Parsing [sent. 7127 len. 10]: I do n't think that would answer my purpose .
Parsing [sent. 7128 len. 9]: Ai n't there any other line open ? '
Parsing [sent. 7129 len. 4]: ` Stop ! '
Parsing [sent. 7130 len. 11]: said Fagin , laying his hand on Noah 's knee .
Parsing [sent. 7131 len. 6]: ` The kinchin lay . '
Parsing [sent. 7132 len. 82]: ` The kinchins , my dear , ' said Fagin , ` is the young children that 's sent on errands by their mothers , with sixpences and shillings ; and the lay is just to take their money away -- they 've always got it ready in their hands , -- then knock 'em into the kennel , and walk off very slow , as if there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt itself .
Parsing [sent. 7133 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 7134 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 7135 len. 3]: ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 7136 len. 3]: ` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 7137 len. 3]: ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 7138 len. 12]: roared Mr. Claypole , kicking up his legs in an ecstasy .
Parsing [sent. 7139 len. 10]: ` Lord , that 's the very thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 7140 len. 59]: ` To be sure it is , ' replied Fagin ; ` and you can have a few good beats chalked out in Camden Town , and Battle Bridge , and neighborhoods like that , where they 're always going errands ; and you can upset as many kinchins as you want , any hour in the day .
Parsing [sent. 7141 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 7142 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 7143 len. 3]: ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 7144 len. 24]: With this , Fagin poked Mr. Claypole in the side , and they joined in a burst of laughter both long and loud .
Parsing [sent. 7145 len. 9]: ` Well , that 's all right ! '
Parsing [sent. 7146 len. 14]: said Noah , when he had recovered himself , and Charlotte had returned .
Parsing [sent. 7147 len. 9]: ` What time to-morrow shall we say ? '
Parsing [sent. 7148 len. 6]: ` Will ten do ? '
Parsing [sent. 7149 len. 22]: asked Fagin , adding , as Mr. Claypole nodded assent , ` What name shall I tell my good friend . '
Parsing [sent. 7150 len. 16]: ` Mr. Bolter , ' replied Noah , who had prepared himself for such emergency .
Parsing [sent. 7151 len. 5]: ` Mr. Morris Bolter .
Parsing [sent. 7152 len. 6]: This is Mrs. Bolter . '
Parsing [sent. 7153 len. 17]: ` Mrs. Bolter 's humble servant , ' said Fagin , bowing with grotesque politeness . '
Parsing [sent. 7154 len. 11]: I hope I shall know her better very shortly . '
Parsing [sent. 7155 len. 10]: ` Do you hear the gentleman , Charlotte ? '
Parsing [sent. 7156 len. 4]: thundered Mr. Claypole .
Parsing [sent. 7157 len. 8]: ` Yes , Noah , dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 7158 len. 8]: replied Mrs. Bolter , extending her hand .
Parsing [sent. 7159 len. 28]: ` She calls me Noah , as a sort of fond way of talking , ' said Mr. Morris Bolter , late Claypole , turning to Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7160 len. 5]: ` You understand ? '
Parsing [sent. 7161 len. 19]: ` Oh yes , I understand -- perfectly , ' replied Fagin , telling the truth for once .
Parsing [sent. 7162 len. 3]: ` Good-night !
Parsing [sent. 7163 len. 3]: Good-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 7164 len. 13]: With many adieus and good wishes , Mr. Fagin went his way .
Parsing [sent. 7165 len. 64]: Noah Claypole , bespeaking his good lady 's attention , proceeded to enlighten her relative to the arrangement he had made , with all that haughtiness and air of superiority , becoming , not only a member of the sterner sex , but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on the kinchin lay , in London and its vicinity .
Parsing [sent. 7166 len. 28]: CHAPTER XLIII WHEREIN IS SHOWN HOW THE ARTFUL DODGER GOT INTO TROUBLE ` And so it was you that was your own friend , was it ? '
Parsing [sent. 7167 len. 30]: asked Mr. Claypole , otherwise Bolter , when , by virtue of the compact entered into between them , he had removed next day to Fagin 's house . ''
Parsing [sent. 7168 len. 10]: Cod , I thought as much last night ! '
Parsing [sent. 7169 len. 21]: ` Every man 's his own friend , my dear , ' replied Fagin , with his most insinuating grin .
Parsing [sent. 7170 len. 13]: ` He has n't as good a one as himself anywhere . '
Parsing [sent. 7171 len. 19]: ` Except sometimes , ' replied Morris Bolter , assuming the air of a man of the world .
Parsing [sent. 7172 len. 15]: ` Some people are nobody 's enemies but their own , yer know . '
Parsing [sent. 7173 len. 10]: ` Do n't believe that , ' said Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7174 len. 31]: ` When a man 's his own enemy , it 's only because he 's too much his own friend ; not because he 's careful for everybody but himself .
Parsing [sent. 7175 len. 2]: Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 7176 len. 2]: pooh !
Parsing [sent. 7177 len. 10]: There ai n't such a thing in nature . '
Parsing [sent. 7178 len. 16]: ` There ough n't to be , if there is , ' replied Mr. Bolter .
Parsing [sent. 7179 len. 6]: ` That stands to reason .
Parsing [sent. 7180 len. 17]: Some conjurers say that number three is the magic number , and some say number seven .
Parsing [sent. 7181 len. 9]: It 's neither , my friend , neither .
Parsing [sent. 7182 len. 5]: It 's number one .
Parsing [sent. 7183 len. 3]: ` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 7184 len. 3]: ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 7185 len. 4]: cried Mr. Bolter .
Parsing [sent. 7186 len. 7]: ` Number one for ever . '
Parsing [sent. 7187 len. 48]: ` In a little community like ours , my dear , ' said Fagin , who felt it necessary to qualify this position , ` we have a general number one , without considering me too as the same , and all the other young people . '
Parsing [sent. 7188 len. 7]: ` Oh , the devil ! '
Parsing [sent. 7189 len. 4]: exclaimed Mr. Bolter .
Parsing [sent. 7190 len. 34]: ` You see , ' pursued Fagin , affecting to disregard this interruption , ` we are so mixed up together , and identified in our interests , that it must be so .
Parsing [sent. 7191 len. 18]: For instance , it 's your object to take care of number one -- meaning yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 7192 len. 8]: ` Certainly , ' replied Mr. Bolter .
Parsing [sent. 7193 len. 7]: ` Yer about right there . '
Parsing [sent. 7194 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 7195 len. 21]: You ca n't take care of yourself , number one , without taking care of me , number one . '
Parsing [sent. 7196 len. 22]: ` Number two , you mean , ' said Mr. Bolter , who was largely endowed with the quality of selfishness .
Parsing [sent. 7197 len. 8]: ` No , I do n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 7198 len. 3]: retorted Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7199 len. 18]: ` I 'm of the same importance to you , as you are to yourself . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7200 len. 39]: I say , ' interrupted Mr. Bolter , ` yer a very nice man , and I 'm very fond of yer ; but we ai n't quite so thick together , as all that comes to . '
Parsing [sent. 7201 len. 22]: ` Only think , ' said Fagin , shrugging his shoulders , and stretching out his hands ; ` only consider .
Parsing [sent. 7202 len. 53]: You 've done what 's a very pretty thing , and what I love you for doing ; but what at the same time would put the cravat round your throat , that 's so very easily tied and so very difficult to unloose -- in plain English , the halter ! '
Parsing [sent. 7203 len. 30]: Mr. Bolter put his hand to his neckerchief , as if he felt it inconveniently tight ; and murmured an assent , qualified in tone but not in substance .
Parsing [sent. 7204 len. 43]: ` The gallows , ' continued Fagin , ` the gallows , my dear , is an ugly finger-post , which points out a very short and sharp turning that has stopped many a bold fellow 's career on the broad highway .
Parsing [sent. 7205 len. 22]: To keep in the easy road , and keep it at a distance , is object number one with you . '
Parsing [sent. 7206 len. 11]: ` Of course it is , ' replied Mr. Bolter .
Parsing [sent. 7207 len. 11]: ` What do yer talk about such things for ? '
Parsing [sent. 7208 len. 18]: ` Only to show you my meaning clearly , ' said the Jew , raising his eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 7209 len. 13]: ` To be able to do that , you depend upon me .
Parsing [sent. 7210 len. 13]: To keep my little business all snug , I depend upon you .
Parsing [sent. 7211 len. 13]: The first is your number one , the second my number one .
Parsing [sent. 7212 len. 57]: The more you value your number one , the more careful you must be of mine ; so we come at last to what I told you at first -- that a regard for number one holds us all together , and must do so , unless we would all go to pieces in company . '
Parsing [sent. 7213 len. 12]: ` That 's true , ' rejoined Mr. Bolter , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 7214 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7215 len. 7]: yer a cunning old codger ! '
Parsing [sent. 7216 len. 50]: Mr. Fagin saw , with delight , that this tribute to his powers was no mere compliment , but that he had really impressed his recruit with a sense of his wily genius , which it was most important that he should entertain in the outset of their acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 7217 len. 86]: To strengthen an impression so desirable and useful , he followed up the blow by acquainting him , in some detail , with the magnitude and extent of his operations ; blending truth and fiction together , as best served his purpose ; and bringing both to bear , with so much art , that Mr. Bolter 's respect visibly increased , and became tempered , at the same time , with a degree of wholesome fear , which it was highly desirable to awaken .
Parsing [sent. 7218 len. 22]: ` It 's this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under heavy losses , ' said Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7219 len. 13]: ` My best hand was taken from me , yesterday morning . '
Parsing [sent. 7220 len. 11]: ` You do n't mean to say he died ? '
Parsing [sent. 7221 len. 4]: cried Mr. Bolter .
Parsing [sent. 7222 len. 16]: ` No , no , ' replied Fagin , ` not so bad as that .
Parsing [sent. 7223 len. 6]: Not quite so bad . '
Parsing [sent. 7224 len. 16]: ` What , I suppose he was -- ' ` Wanted , ' interposed Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7225 len. 8]: ` Yes , he was wanted . '
Parsing [sent. 7226 len. 5]: ` Very particular ? '
Parsing [sent. 7227 len. 4]: inquired Mr. Bolter .
Parsing [sent. 7228 len. 11]: ` No , ' replied Fagin , ` not very .
Parsing [sent. 7229 len. 42]: He was charged with attempting to pick a pocket , and they found a silver snuff-box on him , -- his own , my dear , his own , for he took snuff himself , and was very fond of it .
Parsing [sent. 7230 len. 14]: They remanded him till to-day , for they thought they knew the owner .
Parsing [sent. 7231 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7232 len. 20]: he was worth fifty boxes , and I 'd give the price of as many to have him back .
Parsing [sent. 7233 len. 18]: You should have known the Dodger , my dear ; you should have known the Dodger . '
Parsing [sent. 7234 len. 19]: ` Well , but I shall know him , I hope ; do n't yer think so ? '
Parsing [sent. 7235 len. 4]: said Mr. Bolter .
Parsing [sent. 7236 len. 15]: ` I 'm doubtful about it , ' replied Fagin , with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 7237 len. 44]: ` If they do n't get any fresh evidence , it 'll only be a summary conviction , and we shall have him back again after six weeks or so ; but , if they do , it 's a case of lagging .
Parsing [sent. 7238 len. 15]: They know what a clever lad he is ; he 'll be a lifer .
Parsing [sent. 7239 len. 12]: They 'll make the Artful nothing less than a lifer . '
Parsing [sent. 7240 len. 12]: ` What do you mean by lagging and a lifer ? '
Parsing [sent. 7241 len. 4]: demanded Mr. Bolter .
Parsing [sent. 7242 len. 26]: ` What 's the good of talking in that way to me ; why do n't yer speak so as I can understand yer ? '
Parsing [sent. 7243 len. 69]: Fagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the vulgar tongue ; and , being interpreted , Mr. Bolter would have been informed that they represented that combination of words , ` transportation for life , ' when the dialogue was cut short by the entry of Master Bates , with his hands in his breeches-pockets , and his face twisted into a look of semi-comical woe .
Parsing [sent. 7244 len. 26]: ` It 's all up , Fagin , ' said Charley , when he and his new companion had been made known to each other .
Parsing [sent. 7245 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 7246 len. 39]: ` They 've found the gentleman as owns the box ; two or three more 's a coming to ` dentify him ; and the Artful 's booked for a passage out , ' replied Master Bates . '
Parsing [sent. 7247 len. 28]: I must have a full suit of mourning , Fagin , and a hatband , to wisit him in , afore he sets out upon his travels .
Parsing [sent. 7248 len. 24]: To think of Jack Dawkins -- lummy Jack -- the Dodger -- the Artful Dodger -- going abroad for a common twopenny-halfpenny sneeze-box !
Parsing [sent. 7249 len. 22]: I never thought he 'd a done it under a gold watch , chain , and seals , at the lowest .
Parsing [sent. 7250 len. 37]: Oh , why did n't he rob some rich old gentleman of all his walables , and go out as a gentleman , and not like a common prig , without no honour nor glory ! '
Parsing [sent. 7251 len. 26]: With this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend , Master Bates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and despondency .
Parsing [sent. 7252 len. 15]: ` What do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for ! '
Parsing [sent. 7253 len. 11]: exclaimed Fagin , darting an angry look at his pupil .
Parsing [sent. 7254 len. 11]: ` Was n't he always the top-sawyer among you all !
Parsing [sent. 7255 len. 17]: Is there one of you that could touch him or come near him on any scent !
Parsing [sent. 7256 len. 3]: Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 7257 len. 22]: ` Not one , ' replied Master Bates , in a voice rendered husky by regret ; ` not one . '
Parsing [sent. 7258 len. 9]: ` Then what do you talk of ? '
Parsing [sent. 7259 len. 13]: replied Fagin angrily ; ` what are you blubbering for ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 7260 len. 12]: Cause it is n't on the rec-ord , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 7261 len. 41]: said Charley , chafed into perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets ; '' cause it ca n't come out in the ` dictment ; 'cause nobody will never know half of what he was .
Parsing [sent. 7262 len. 9]: How will he stand in the Newgate Calendar ?
Parsing [sent. 7263 len. 7]: P'raps not be there at all .
Parsing [sent. 7264 len. 15]: Oh , my eye , my eye , wot a blow it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 7265 len. 3]: ` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 7266 len. 3]: ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 7267 len. 42]: cried Fagin , extending his right hand , and turning to Mr. Bolter in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the palsy ; ` see what a pride they take in their profession , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 7268 len. 6]: Ai n't it beautiful ? '
Parsing [sent. 7269 len. 35]: Mr. Bolter nodded assent , and Fagin , after contemplating the grief of Charley Bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction , stepped up to that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 7270 len. 25]: ` Never mind , Charley , ' said Fagin soothingly ; ` it 'll come out , it 'll be sure to come out .
Parsing [sent. 7271 len. 26]: They 'll all know what a clever fellow he was ; he 'll show it himself , and not disgrace his old pals and teachers .
Parsing [sent. 7272 len. 7]: Think how young he is too !
Parsing [sent. 7273 len. 16]: What a distinction , Charley , to be lagged at his time of life ! '
Parsing [sent. 7274 len. 11]: ` Well , it is a honour that is ! '
Parsing [sent. 7275 len. 7]: said Charley , a little consoled .
Parsing [sent. 7276 len. 13]: ` He shall have all he wants , ' continued the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 7277 len. 16]: ` He shall be kept in the Stone Jug , Charley , like a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 7278 len. 4]: Like a gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 7279 len. 25]: With his beer every day , and money in his pocket to pitch and toss with , if he ca n't spend it . '
Parsing [sent. 7280 len. 8]: ` No , shall he though ? '
Parsing [sent. 7281 len. 4]: cried Charley Bates .
Parsing [sent. 7282 len. 84]: ` Ay , that he shall , ' replied Fagin , ` and we 'll have a big-wig , Charley : one that 's got the greatest gift of the gab : to carry on his defence ; and he shall make a speech for himself too , if he likes ; and we 'll read it all in the papers -- `` Artful Dodger -- shrieks of laughter -- here the court was convulsed '' -- eh , Charley , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 7283 len. 3]: ` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 7284 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 7285 len. 18]: laughed Master Bates , ` what a lark that would be , would n't it , Fagin ?
Parsing [sent. 7286 len. 14]: I say , how the Artful would bother 'em would n't he ? '
Parsing [sent. 7287 len. 4]: ` Would ! '
Parsing [sent. 7288 len. 3]: cried Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7289 len. 8]: ` He shall -- he will ! '
Parsing [sent. 7290 len. 20]: ` Ah , to be sure , so he will , ' repeated Charley , rubbing his hands . '
Parsing [sent. 7291 len. 19]: I think I see him now , ' cried the Jew , bending his eyes upon his pupil .
Parsing [sent. 7292 len. 10]: ` So do I , ' cried Charley Bates .
Parsing [sent. 7293 len. 3]: ` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 7294 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 7295 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 7296 len. 18]: so do I. I see it all afore me , upon my soul I do , Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7297 len. 4]: What a game !
Parsing [sent. 7298 len. 5]: What a regular game !
Parsing [sent. 7299 len. 35]: All the big-wigs trying to look solemn , and Jack Dawkins addressing of 'em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judge 's own son making a speech arter dinner -- ha !
Parsing [sent. 7300 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 7301 len. 3]: ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 7302 len. 82]: In fact , Mr. Fagin had so well humoured his young friend 's eccentric disposition , that Master Bates , who had at first been disposed to consider the imprisoned Dodger rather in the light of a victim , now looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and exquisite humour , and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of displaying his abilities .
Parsing [sent. 7303 len. 21]: ` We must know how he gets on to-day , by some handy means or other , ' said Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7304 len. 6]: ` Let me think . '
Parsing [sent. 7305 len. 6]: ` Shall I go ? '
Parsing [sent. 7306 len. 3]: asked Charley .
Parsing [sent. 7307 len. 10]: ` Not for the world , ' replied Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7308 len. 27]: ` Are you mad , my dear , stark mad , that you 'd walk into the very place where -- No , Charley , no .
Parsing [sent. 7309 len. 10]: One is enough to lose at a time . '
Parsing [sent. 7310 len. 13]: ` You do n't mean to go yourself , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 7311 len. 7]: said Charley with a humorous leer .
Parsing [sent. 7312 len. 14]: ` That would n't quite fit , ' replied Fagin shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 7313 len. 12]: ` Then why do n't you send this new cove ? '
Parsing [sent. 7314 len. 12]: asked Master Bates , laying his hand on Noah 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 7315 len. 6]: ` Nobody knows him . '
Parsing [sent. 7316 len. 13]: ` Why , if he did n't mind -- ' observed Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7317 len. 4]: ` Mind ! '
Parsing [sent. 7318 len. 3]: interposed Charley .
Parsing [sent. 7319 len. 9]: ` What should he have to mind ? '
Parsing [sent. 7320 len. 21]: ` Really nothing , my dear , ' said Fagin , turning to Mr. Bolter , ` really nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 7321 len. 32]: ` Oh , I dare say about that , yer know , ' observed Noah , backing towards the door , and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm .
Parsing [sent. 7322 len. 9]: ` No , no -- none of that .
Parsing [sent. 7323 len. 12]: It 's not in my department , that ai n't . '
Parsing [sent. 7324 len. 10]: ` Wot department has he got , Fagin ? '
Parsing [sent. 7325 len. 13]: inquired Master Bates , surveying Noah 's lank form with much disgust .
Parsing [sent. 7326 len. 28]: ` The cutting away when there 's anything wrong , and the eating all the wittles when there 's everything right ; is that his branch ? '
Parsing [sent. 7327 len. 34]: ` Never mind , ' retorted Mr. Bolter ; ` and do n't yer take liberties with yer superiors , little boy , or yer 'll find yerself in the wrong shop . '
Parsing [sent. 7328 len. 139]: Master Bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat , that it was some time before Fagin could interpose , and represent to Mr. Bolter that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the police-office ; that , inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had engaged , nor any description of his person , had yet been forwarded to the metropolis , it was very probable that he was not even suspected of having resorted to it for shelter ; and that , if he were properly disguised , it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in London , inasmuch as it would be , of all places , the very last , to which he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will .
Parsing [sent. 7329 len. 39]: Persuaded , in part , by these representations , but overborne in a much greater degree by his fear of Fagin , Mr. Bolter at length consented , with a very bad grace , to undertake the expedition .
Parsing [sent. 7330 len. 35]: By Fagin 's directions , he immediately substituted for his own attire , a waggoner 's frock , velveteen breeches , and leather leggings : all of which articles the Jew had at hand .
Parsing [sent. 7331 len. 20]: He was likewise furnished with a felt hat well garnished with turnpike tickets ; and a carter 's whip .
Parsing [sent. 7332 len. 63]: Thus equipped , he was to saunter into the office , as some country fellow from Covent Garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his curiousity ; and as he was as awkward , ungainly , and raw-boned a fellow as need be , Mr. Fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to perfection .
Parsing [sent. 7333 len. 42]: These arrangements completed , he was informed of the necessary signs and tokens by which to recognise the Artful Dodger , and was conveyed by Master Bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short distance of Bow Street .
Parsing [sent. 7334 len. 66]: Having described the precise situation of the office , and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk straight up the passage , and when he got into the side , and pull off his hat as he went into the room , Charley Bates bade him hurry on alone , and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting .
Parsing [sent. 7335 len. 57]: Noah Claypole , or Morris Bolter as the reader pleases , punctually followed the directions he had received , which -- Master Bates being pretty well acquainted with the locality -- were so exact that he was enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question , or meeting with any interruption by the way .
Parsing [sent. 7336 len. 110]: He found himself jostled among a crowd of people , chiefly women , who were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room , at the upper end of which was a raised platform railed off from the rest , with a dock for the prisoners on the left hand against the wall , a box for the witnesses in the middle , and a desk for the magistrates on the right ; the awful locality last named , being screened off by a partition which concealed the bench from the common gaze , and left the vulgar to imagine -LRB- if they could -RRB- the full majesty of justice .
Parsing [sent. 7337 len. 42]: There were only a couple of women in the dock , who were nodding to their admiring friends , while the clerk read some depositions to a couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the table .
Parsing [sent. 7338 len. 72]: A jailer stood reclining against the dock-rail , tapping his nose listlessly with a large key , except when he repressed an undue tendency to conversation among the idlers , by proclaiming silence ; or looked sternly up to bid some woman ` Take that baby out , ' when the gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries , half-smothered in the mother 's shawl , from some meagre infant .
Parsing [sent. 7339 len. 17]: The room smelt close and unwholesome ; the walls were dirt-discoloured ; and the ceiling blackened .
Parsing [sent. 7340 len. 72]: There was an old smoky bust over the mantel-shelf , and a dusty clock above the dock -- the only thing present , that seemed to go on as it ought ; for depravity , or poverty , or an habitual acquaintance with both , had left a taint on all the animate matter , hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inaminate object that frowned upon it .
Parsing [sent. 7341 len. 64]: Noah looked eagerly about him for the Dodger ; but although there were several women who would have done very well for that distinguished character 's mother or sister , and more than one man who might be supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father , nobody at all answering the description given him of Mr. Dawkins was to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 7342 len. 50]: He waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women , being committed for trial , went flaunting out ; and then was quickly relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once could be no other than the object of his visit .
Parsing [sent. 7343 len. 76]: It was indeed Mr. Dawkins , who , shuffling into the office with the big coat sleeves tucked up as usual , his left hand in his pocket , and his hat in his right hand , preceded the jailer , with a rolling gait altogether indescribable , and , taking his place in the dock , requested in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that ` ere disgraceful sitivation for .
Parsing [sent. 7344 len. 9]: ` Hold your tongue , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7345 len. 4]: said the jailer .
Parsing [sent. 7346 len. 11]: ` I 'm an Englishman , ai n't I ? '
Parsing [sent. 7347 len. 4]: rejoined the Dodger .
Parsing [sent. 7348 len. 7]: ` Where are my priwileges ? '
Parsing [sent. 7349 len. 21]: ` You 'll get your privileges soon enough , ' retorted the jailer , ` and pepper with 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 7350 len. 31]: ` We 'll see wot the Secretary of State for the Home Affairs has got to say to the beaks , if I do n't , ' replied Mr. Dawkins .
Parsing [sent. 7351 len. 4]: ` Now then !
Parsing [sent. 7352 len. 6]: Wot is this here business ?
Parsing [sent. 7353 len. 88]: I shall thank the madg ` strates to dispose of this here little affair , and not to keep me while they read the paper , for I 've got an appointment with a genelman in the City , and as I am a man of my word and wery punctual in business matters , he 'll go away if I ai n't there to my time , and then pr ` aps ther wo n't be an action for damage against them as kep me away .
Parsing [sent. 7354 len. 7]: Oh no , certainly not ! '
Parsing [sent. 7355 len. 43]: At this point , the Dodger , with a show of being very particular with a view to proceedings to be had thereafter , desired the jailer to communicate ` the names of them two files as was on the bench . '
Parsing [sent. 7356 len. 25]: Which so tickled the spectators , that they laughed almost as heartily as Master Bates could have done if he had heard the request .
Parsing [sent. 7357 len. 5]: ` Silence there ! '
Parsing [sent. 7358 len. 4]: cried the jailer .
Parsing [sent. 7359 len. 6]: ` What is this ? '
Parsing [sent. 7360 len. 7]: inquired one of the magistrates . '
Parsing [sent. 7361 len. 8]: A pick-pocketing case , your worship . '
Parsing [sent. 7362 len. 10]: ` Has the boy ever been here before ? '
Parsing [sent. 7363 len. 16]: ` He ought to have been , a many times , ' replied the jailer .
Parsing [sent. 7364 len. 9]: ` He has been pretty well everywhere else .
Parsing [sent. 7365 len. 9]: I know him well , your worship . '
Parsing [sent. 7366 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7367 len. 8]: you know me , do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7368 len. 11]: cried the Artful , making a note of the statement .
Parsing [sent. 7369 len. 4]: ` Wery good .
Parsing [sent. 7370 len. 13]: That 's a case of deformation of character , any way . '
Parsing [sent. 7371 len. 12]: Here there was another laugh , and another cry of silence .
Parsing [sent. 7372 len. 10]: ` Now then , where are the witnesses ? '
Parsing [sent. 7373 len. 4]: said the clerk .
Parsing [sent. 7374 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7375 len. 9]: that 's right , ' added the Dodger .
Parsing [sent. 7376 len. 5]: ` Where are they ?
Parsing [sent. 7377 len. 8]: I should like to see 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 7378 len. 56]: This wish was immediately gratified , for a policeman stepped forward who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in a crowd , and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom , which , being a very old one , he deliberately put back again , after trying in on his own countenance .
Parsing [sent. 7379 len. 45]: For this reason , he took the Dodger into custody as soon as he could get near him , and the said Dodger , being searched , had upon his person a silver snuff-box , with the owner 's name engraved upon the lid .
Parsing [sent. 7380 len. 50]: This gentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court Guide , and being then and there present , swore that the snuff-box was his , and that he had missed it on the previous day , the moment he had disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to .
Parsing [sent. 7381 len. 29]: He had also remarked a young gentleman in the throng , particularly active in making his way about , and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him .
Parsing [sent. 7382 len. 12]: ` Have you anything to ask this witness , boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 7383 len. 5]: said the magistrate . '
Parsing [sent. 7384 len. 18]: I would n't abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with him ' replied the Dodger .
Parsing [sent. 7385 len. 10]: ` Have you anything to say at all ? '
Parsing [sent. 7386 len. 15]: ` Do you hear his worship ask if you 've anything to say ? '
Parsing [sent. 7387 len. 13]: inquired the jailer , nudging the silent Dodger with his elbow . '
Parsing [sent. 7388 len. 18]: I beg your pardon , ' said the Dodger , looking up with an air of abstraction .
Parsing [sent. 7389 len. 13]: ` Did you redress yourself to me , my man ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7390 len. 20]: I never see such an out-and-out young wagabond , your worship , ' observed the officer with a grin .
Parsing [sent. 7391 len. 13]: ` Do you mean to say anything , you young shaver ? '
Parsing [sent. 7392 len. 109]: ` No , ' replied the Dodger , ` not here , for this ai n't the shop for justice : besides which , my attorney is a-breakfasting this morning with the Wice President of the House of Commons ; but I shall have something to say elsewhere , and so will he , and so will a wery numerous and ` spectable circle of acquaintance as 'll make them beaks wish they 'd never been born , or that they 'd got their footmen to hang 'em up to their own hat-pegs , afore they let 'em come out this morning to try it on upon me .
Parsing [sent. 7393 len. 7]: I 'll -- ' ` There !
Parsing [sent. 7394 len. 6]: He 's fully committed ! '
Parsing [sent. 7395 len. 4]: interposed the clerk .
Parsing [sent. 7396 len. 6]: ` Take him away . '
Parsing [sent. 7397 len. 9]: ` Come on , ' said the jailer .
Parsing [sent. 7398 len. 4]: ` Oh ah !
Parsing [sent. 7399 len. 20]: I 'll come on , ' replied the Dodger , brushing his hat with the palm of his hand .
Parsing [sent. 7400 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7401 len. 29]: -LRB- to the Bench -RRB- it 's no use your looking frightened ; I wo n't show you no mercy , not a ha ` porth of it .
Parsing [sent. 7402 len. 10]: YOU 'LL pay for this , my fine fellers .
Parsing [sent. 7403 len. 8]: I would n't be you for something !
Parsing [sent. 7404 len. 21]: I would n't go free , now , if you was to fall down on your knees and ask me .
Parsing [sent. 7405 len. 8]: Here , carry me off to prison !
Parsing [sent. 7406 len. 5]: Take me away ! '
Parsing [sent. 7407 len. 49]: With these last words , the Dodger suffered himself to be led off by the collar ; threatening , till he got into the yard , to make a parliamentary business of it ; and then grinning in the officer 's face , with great glee and self-approval .
Parsing [sent. 7408 len. 28]: Having seen him locked up by himself in a little cell , Noah made the best of his way back to where he had left Master Bates .
Parsing [sent. 7409 len. 47]: After waiting here some time , he was joined by that young gentleman , who had prudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully abroad from a snug retreat , and ascertained that his new friend had not been followed by any impertinent person .
Parsing [sent. 7410 len. 33]: The two hastened back together , to bear to Mr. Fagin the animating news that the Dodger was doing full justice to his bringing-up , and establishing for himself a glorious reputation .
Parsing [sent. 7411 len. 15]: CHAPTER XLIV THE TIME ARRIVES FOR NANCY TO REDEEM HER PLEDGE TO ROSE MAYLIE .
Parsing [sent. 7412 len. 3]: SHE FAILS .
Parsing [sent. 7413 len. 38]: Adept as she was , in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation , the girl Nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of the step she had taken , wrought upon her mind .
Parsing [sent. 7414 len. 41]: She remembered that both the crafty Jew and the brutal Sikes had confided to her schemes , which had been hidden from all others : in the full confidence that she was trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 7415 len. 98]: Vile as those schemes were , desperate as were their originators , and bitter as were her feelings towards Fagin , who had led her , step by step , deeper and deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery , whence was no escape ; still , there were times when , even towards him , she felt some relenting , lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp he had so long eluded , and he should fall at last -- richly as he merited such a fate -- by her hand .
Parsing [sent. 7416 len. 41]: But , these were the mere wanderings of a mind unwholly to detach itself from old companions and associations , though enabled to fix itself steadily on one object , and resolved not to be turned aside by any consideration .
Parsing [sent. 7417 len. 70]: Her fears for Sikes would have been more powerful inducements to recoil while there was yet time ; but she had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly kept , she had dropped no clue which could lead to his discovery , she had refused , even for his sake , a refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her -- and what more could she do !
Parsing [sent. 7418 len. 4]: She was resolved .
Parsing [sent. 7419 len. 26]: Though all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion , they forced themselves upon her , again and again , and left their traces too .
Parsing [sent. 7420 len. 12]: She grew pale and thin , even within a few days .
Parsing [sent. 7421 len. 29]: At times , she took no heed of what was passing before her , or no part in conversations where once , she would have been the loudest .
Parsing [sent. 7422 len. 80]: At other times , she laughed without merriment , and was noisy without a moment afterwards -- she sat silent and dejected , brooding with her head upon her hands , while the very effort by which she roused herself , told , more forcibly than even these indications , that she was ill at ease , and that her thoughts were occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the course of discussion by her companions .
Parsing [sent. 7423 len. 16]: It was Sunday night , and the bell of the nearest church struck the hour .
Parsing [sent. 7424 len. 13]: Sikes and the Jew were talking , but they paused to listen .
Parsing [sent. 7425 len. 17]: The girl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched , and listened too .
Parsing [sent. 7426 len. 2]: Eleven .
Parsing [sent. 7427 len. 24]: ` An hour this side of midnight , ' said Sikes , raising the blind to look out and returning to his seat .
Parsing [sent. 7428 len. 8]: ` Dark and heavy it is too .
Parsing [sent. 7429 len. 8]: A good night for business this . '
Parsing [sent. 7430 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 7431 len. 3]: replied Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7432 len. 21]: ` What a pity , Bill , my dear , that there 's none quite ready to be done . '
Parsing [sent. 7433 len. 12]: ` You 're right for once , ' replied Sikes gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 7434 len. 15]: ` It is a pity , for I 'm in the humour too . '
Parsing [sent. 7435 len. 9]: Fagin sighed , and shook his head despondingly .
Parsing [sent. 7436 len. 18]: ` We must make up for lost time when we 've got things into a good train .
Parsing [sent. 7437 len. 10]: That 's all I know , ' said Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 7438 len. 23]: ` That 's the way to talk , my dear , ' replied Fagin , venturing to pat him on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 7439 len. 10]: ` It does me good to hear you . '
Parsing [sent. 7440 len. 9]: ` Does you good , does it ! '
Parsing [sent. 7441 len. 3]: cried Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 7442 len. 8]: ` Well , so be it . '
Parsing [sent. 7443 len. 3]: ` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 7444 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 7445 len. 3]: ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 7446 len. 13]: laughed Fagin , as if he were relieved by even this concession .
Parsing [sent. 7447 len. 9]: ` You 're like yourself to-night , Bill .
Parsing [sent. 7448 len. 6]: Quite like yourself . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7449 len. 33]: I do n't feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my shoulder , so take it away , ' said Sikes , casting off the Jew 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 7450 len. 19]: ` It make you nervous , Bill , -- reminds you of being nabbed , does it ? '
Parsing [sent. 7451 len. 9]: said Fagin , determined not to be offended .
Parsing [sent. 7452 len. 14]: ` Reminds me of being nabbed by the devil , ' returned Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 7453 len. 61]: ` There never was another man with such a face as yours , unless it was your father , and I suppose HE is singeing his grizzled red beard by this time , unless you came straight from the old ` un without any father at all betwixt you ; which I should n't wonder at , a bit . '
Parsing [sent. 7454 len. 43]: Fagin offered no reply to this compliment : but , pulling Sikes by the sleeve , pointed his finger towards Nancy , who had taken advantage of the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet , and was now leaving the room .
Parsing [sent. 7455 len. 4]: ` Hallo ! '
Parsing [sent. 7456 len. 3]: cried Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 7457 len. 3]: ` Nance .
Parsing [sent. 7458 len. 13]: Where 's the gal going to at this time of night ? '
Parsing [sent. 7459 len. 5]: ` Not far . '
Parsing [sent. 7460 len. 7]: ` What answer 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 7461 len. 3]: retorted Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 7462 len. 8]: ` Do you hear me ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7463 len. 11]: I do n't know where , ' replied the girl .
Parsing [sent. 7464 len. 30]: ` Then I do , ' said Sikes , more in the spirit of obstinacy than because he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed .
Parsing [sent. 7465 len. 3]: ` Nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 7466 len. 4]: Sit down . '
Parsing [sent. 7467 len. 6]: ` I 'm not well .
Parsing [sent. 7468 len. 12]: I told you that before , ' rejoined the girl . '
Parsing [sent. 7469 len. 8]: I want a breath of air . '
Parsing [sent. 7470 len. 13]: ` Put your head out of the winder , ' replied Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 7471 len. 13]: ` There 's not enough there , ' said the girl . '
Parsing [sent. 7472 len. 8]: I want it in the street . '
Parsing [sent. 7473 len. 12]: ` Then you wo n't have it , ' replied Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 7474 len. 34]: With which assurance he rose , locked the door , took the key out , and pulling her bonnet from her head , flung it up to the top of an old press .
Parsing [sent. 7475 len. 8]: ` There , ' said the robber .
Parsing [sent. 7476 len. 12]: ` Now stop quietly where you are , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7477 len. 22]: ` It 's not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me , ' said the girl turning very pale .
Parsing [sent. 7478 len. 8]: ` What do you mean , Bill ?
Parsing [sent. 7479 len. 9]: Do you know what you 're doing ? '
Parsing [sent. 7480 len. 9]: ` Know what I 'm -- Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 7481 len. 30]: cried Sikes , turning to Fagin , ` she 's out of her senses , you know , or she dare n't talk to me in that way . '
Parsing [sent. 7482 len. 32]: ` You 'll drive me on the something desperate , ' muttered the girl placing both hands upon her breast , as though to keep down by force some violent outbreak .
Parsing [sent. 7483 len. 16]: ` Let me go , will you , -- this minute -- this instant . '
Parsing [sent. 7484 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 7485 len. 3]: said Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 7486 len. 10]: ` Tell him to let me go , Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7487 len. 4]: He had better .
Parsing [sent. 7488 len. 7]: It 'll be better for him .
Parsing [sent. 7489 len. 6]: Do you hear me ? '
Parsing [sent. 7490 len. 9]: cried Nancy stamping her foot upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 7491 len. 5]: ` Hear you ! '
Parsing [sent. 7492 len. 11]: repeated Sikes turning round in his chair to confront her .
Parsing [sent. 7493 len. 3]: ` Aye !
Parsing [sent. 7494 len. 31]: And if I hear you for half a minute longer , the dog shall have such a grip on your throat as 'll tear some of that screaming voice out .
Parsing [sent. 7495 len. 9]: Wot has come over you , you jade !
Parsing [sent. 7496 len. 5]: Wot is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 7497 len. 44]: ` Let me go , ' said the girl with great earnestness ; then sitting herself down on the floor , before the door , she said , ` Bill , let me go ; you do n't know what you are doing .
Parsing [sent. 7498 len. 6]: You do n't , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 7499 len. 10]: For only one hour -- do -- do ! '
Parsing [sent. 7500 len. 10]: ` Cut my limbs off one by one ! '
Parsing [sent. 7501 len. 23]: cried Sikes , seizing her roughly by the arm , ` If I do n't think the gal 's stark raving mad .
Parsing [sent. 7502 len. 4]: Get up . '
Parsing [sent. 7503 len. 20]: ` Not till you let me go -- not till you let me go -- Never -- never ! '
Parsing [sent. 7504 len. 4]: screamed the girl .
Parsing [sent. 7505 len. 56]: Sikes looked on , for a minute , watching his opportunity , and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her , struggling and wrestling with him by the way , into a small room adjoining , where he sat himself on a bench , and thrusting her into a chair , held her down by force .
Parsing [sent. 7506 len. 27]: She struggled and implored by turns until twelve o'clock had struck , and then , wearied and exhausted , ceased to contest the point any further .
Parsing [sent. 7507 len. 31]: With a caution , backed by many oaths , to make no more efforts to go out that night , Sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7508 len. 4]: ` Whew ! '
Parsing [sent. 7509 len. 10]: said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face .
Parsing [sent. 7510 len. 10]: ` Wot a precious strange gal that is ! '
Parsing [sent. 7511 len. 13]: ` You may say that , Bill , ' replied Fagin thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 7512 len. 7]: ` You may say that . '
Parsing [sent. 7513 len. 20]: ` Wot did she take it into her head to go out to-night for , do you think ? '
Parsing [sent. 7514 len. 3]: asked Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 7515 len. 11]: ` Come ; you should know her better than me .
Parsing [sent. 7516 len. 6]: Wot does is mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 7517 len. 14]: ` Obstinacy ; woman 's obstinacy , I suppose , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 7518 len. 13]: ` Well , I suppose it is , ' growled Sikes . '
Parsing [sent. 7519 len. 16]: I thought I had tamed her , but she 's as bad as ever . '
Parsing [sent. 7520 len. 9]: ` Worse , ' said Fagin thoughtfully . '
Parsing [sent. 7521 len. 14]: I never knew her like this , for such a little cause . '
Parsing [sent. 7522 len. 9]: ` Nor I , ' said Sikes . '
Parsing [sent. 7523 len. 25]: I think she 's got a touch of that fever in her blood yet , and it wo n't come out -- eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 7524 len. 5]: ` Like enough . '
Parsing [sent. 7525 len. 26]: ` I 'll let her a little blood , without troubling the doctor , if she 's took that way again , ' said Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 7526 len. 11]: Fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment .
Parsing [sent. 7527 len. 40]: ` She was hanging about me all day , and night too , when I was stretched on my back ; and you , like a blackhearted wolf as you are , kept yourself aloof , ' said Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 7528 len. 42]: ` We was poor too , all the time , and I think , one way or other , it 's worried and fretted her ; and that being shut up here so long has made her restless -- eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 7529 len. 16]: ` That 's it , my dear , ' replied the Jew in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 7530 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 7531 len. 16]: As he uttered these words , the girl herself appeared and resumed her former seat .
Parsing [sent. 7532 len. 29]: Her eyes were swollen and red ; she rocked herself to and fro ; tossed her head ; and , after a little time , burst out laughing .
Parsing [sent. 7533 len. 12]: ` Why , now she 's on the other tack ! '
Parsing [sent. 7534 len. 13]: exclaimed Sikes , turning a look of excessive surprise on his companion .
Parsing [sent. 7535 len. 27]: Fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then ; and , in a few minutes , the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour .
Parsing [sent. 7536 len. 21]: Whispering Sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing , Fagin took up his hat and bade him good-night .
Parsing [sent. 7537 len. 23]: He paused when he reached the room-door , and looking round , asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs .
Parsing [sent. 7538 len. 15]: ` Light him down , ' said Sikes , who was filling his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 7539 len. 17]: ` It 's a pity he should break his neck himself , and disappoint the sight-seers .
Parsing [sent. 7540 len. 6]: Show him a light . '
Parsing [sent. 7541 len. 11]: Nancy followed the old man downstairs , with a candle .
Parsing [sent. 7542 len. 27]: When they reached the passage , he laid his finger on his lip , and drawing close to the girl , said , in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 7543 len. 10]: ` What is it , Nancy , dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 7544 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 7545 len. 9]: replied the girl , in the same tone .
Parsing [sent. 7546 len. 11]: ` The reason of all this , ' replied Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7547 len. 43]: ` If HE ' -- he pointed with his skinny fore-finger up the stairs -- ` is so hard with you -LRB- he 's a brute , Nance , a brute-beast -RRB- , why do n't you -- ' ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 7548 len. 23]: said the girl , as Fagin paused , with his mouth almost touching her ear , and his eyes looking into hers .
Parsing [sent. 7549 len. 6]: ` No matter just now .
Parsing [sent. 7550 len. 7]: We 'll talk of this again .
Parsing [sent. 7551 len. 13]: You have a friend in me , Nance ; a staunch friend .
Parsing [sent. 7552 len. 11]: I have the means at hand , quiet and close .
Parsing [sent. 7553 len. 17]: If you want revenge on those that treat you like a dog -- like a dog !
Parsing [sent. 7554 len. 15]: worse than his dog , for he humours him sometimes -- come to me .
Parsing [sent. 7555 len. 7]: I say , come to me .
Parsing [sent. 7556 len. 20]: He is the mere hound of a day , but you know me of old , Nance . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7557 len. 16]: I know you well , ' replied the girls , without manifesting the least emotion .
Parsing [sent. 7558 len. 4]: ` Good-night . '
Parsing [sent. 7559 len. 42]: She shrank back , as Fagin offered to lay his hand on hers , but said good-night again , in a steady voice , and , answering his parting look with a nod of intelligence , closed the door between them .
Parsing [sent. 7560 len. 17]: Fagin walked towards his home , intent upon the thoughts that were working within his brain .
Parsing [sent. 7561 len. 45]: He had conceived the idea -- not from what had just passed though that had tended to confirm him , but slowly and by degrees -- that Nancy , wearied of the housebreaker 's brutality , had conceived an attachment for some new friend .
Parsing [sent. 7562 len. 67]: Her altered manner , her repeated absences from home alone , her comparative indifference to the interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous , and , added to these , her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a particular hour , all favoured the supposition , and rendered it , to him at least , almost matter of certainty .
Parsing [sent. 7563 len. 12]: The object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons .
Parsing [sent. 7564 len. 25]: He would be a valuable acquisition with such an assistant as Nancy , and must -LRB- thus Fagin argued -RRB- be secured without delay .
Parsing [sent. 7565 len. 13]: There was another , and a darker object , to be gained .
Parsing [sent. 7566 len. 22]: Sikes knew too much , and his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less , because the wounds were hidden .
Parsing [sent. 7567 len. 53]: The girl must know , well , that if she shook him off , she could never be safe from his fury , and that it would be surely wreaked -- to the maiming of limbs , or perhaps the loss of life -- on the object of her more recent fancy .
Parsing [sent. 7568 len. 23]: ` With a little persuasion , ' thought Fagin , ` what more likely than that she would consent to poison him ?
Parsing [sent. 7569 len. 17]: Women have done such things , and worse , to secure the same object before now .
Parsing [sent. 7570 len. 40]: There would be the dangerous villain : the man I hate : gone ; another secured in his place ; and my influence over the girl , with a knowledge of this crime to back it , unlimited . '
Parsing [sent. 7571 len. 54]: These things passed through the mind of Fagin , during the short time he sat alone , in the housebreaker 's room ; and with them uppermost in his thoughts , he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him , of sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting .
Parsing [sent. 7572 len. 17]: There was no expression of surprise , no assumption of an inability to understand his meaning .
Parsing [sent. 7573 len. 6]: The girl clearly comprehended it .
Parsing [sent. 7574 len. 7]: Her glance at parting showed THAT .
Parsing [sent. 7575 len. 27]: But perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of Sikes , and that was one of the chief ends to be attained .
Parsing [sent. 7576 len. 21]: ` How , ' thought Fagin , as he crept homeward , ` can I increase my influence with her ?
Parsing [sent. 7577 len. 8]: what new power can I acquire ? '
Parsing [sent. 7578 len. 7]: Such brains are fertile in expedients .
Parsing [sent. 7579 len. 56]: If , without extracting a confession from herself , he laid a watch , discovered the object of her altered regard , and threatened to reveal the whole history to Sikes -LRB- of whom she stood in no common fear -RRB- unless she entered into his designs , could he not secure her compliance ? '
Parsing [sent. 7580 len. 10]: I can , ' said Fagin , almost aloud .
Parsing [sent. 7581 len. 8]: ` She durst not refuse me then .
Parsing [sent. 7582 len. 10]: Not for her life , not for her life !
Parsing [sent. 7583 len. 5]: I have it all .
Parsing [sent. 7584 len. 12]: The means are ready , and shall be set to work .
Parsing [sent. 7585 len. 7]: I shall have you yet ! '
Parsing [sent. 7586 len. 67]: He cast back a dark look , and a threatening motion of the hand , towards the spot where he had left the bolder villian ; and went on his way : busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment , which he wrenched tightly in his grasp , as though there were a hated enemy crushed with every motion of his fingers .
Parsing [sent. 7587 len. 56]: CHAPTER XLV NOAH CLAYPOLE IS EMPLOYED BY FAGIN ON A SECRET MISSION The old man was up , betimes , next morning , and waited impatiently for the appearance of his new associate , who after a delay that seemed interminable , at length presented himself , and commenced a voracious assault on the breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 7588 len. 18]: ` Bolter , ' said Fagin , drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite Morris Bolter .
Parsing [sent. 7589 len. 11]: ` Well , here I am , ' returned Noah .
Parsing [sent. 7590 len. 6]: ` What 's the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 7591 len. 14]: Do n't yer ask me to do anything till I have done eating .
Parsing [sent. 7592 len. 9]: That 's a great fault in this place .
Parsing [sent. 7593 len. 10]: Yer never get time enough over yer meals . '
Parsing [sent. 7594 len. 13]: ` You can talk as you eat , ca n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7595 len. 18]: said Fagin , cursing his dear young friend 's greediness from the very bottom of his heart .
Parsing [sent. 7596 len. 8]: ` Oh yes , I can talk .
Parsing [sent. 7597 len. 19]: I get on better when I talk , ' said Noah , cutting a monstrous slice of bread .
Parsing [sent. 7598 len. 6]: ` Where 's Charlotte ? '
Parsing [sent. 7599 len. 8]: ` Out , ' said Fagin . '
Parsing [sent. 7600 len. 21]: I sent her out this morning with the other young woman , because I wanted us to be alone . '
Parsing [sent. 7601 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 7602 len. 4]: said Noah . '
Parsing [sent. 7603 len. 13]: I wish yer 'd ordered her to make some buttered toast first .
Parsing [sent. 7604 len. 2]: Well .
Parsing [sent. 7605 len. 3]: Talk away .
Parsing [sent. 7606 len. 7]: Yer wo n't interrupt me . '
Parsing [sent. 7607 len. 30]: There seemed , indeed , no great fear of anything interrupting him , as he had evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of business .
Parsing [sent. 7608 len. 13]: ` You did well yesterday , my dear , ' said Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7609 len. 3]: ` Beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 7610 len. 11]: Six shillings and ninepence halfpenny on the very first day !
Parsing [sent. 7611 len. 11]: The kinchin lay will be a fortune to you . '
Parsing [sent. 7612 len. 18]: ` Do n't you forget to add three pint-pots and a milk-can , ' said Mr. Bolter .
Parsing [sent. 7613 len. 8]: ` No , no , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 7614 len. 17]: The pint-pots were great strokes of genius : but the milk-can was a perfect masterpiece . '
Parsing [sent. 7615 len. 17]: ` Pretty well , I think , for a beginner , ' remarked Mr. Bolter complacently .
Parsing [sent. 7616 len. 20]: ` The pots I took off airy railings , and the milk-can was standing by itself outside a public-house .
Parsing [sent. 7617 len. 17]: I thought it might get rusty with the rain , or catch cold , yer know .
Parsing [sent. 7618 len. 2]: Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 7619 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 7620 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 7621 len. 3]: ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 7622 len. 41]: Fagin affected to laugh very heartily ; and Mr. Bolter having had his laugh out , took a series of large bites , which finished his first hunk of bread and butter , and assisted himself to a second . '
Parsing [sent. 7623 len. 37]: I want you , Bolter , ' said Fagin , leaning over the table , ` to do a piece of work for me , my dear , that needs great care and caution . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7624 len. 27]: I say , ' rejoined Bolter , ` do n't yer go shoving me into danger , or sending me any more o ' yer police-offices .
Parsing [sent. 7625 len. 17]: That do n't suit me , that do n't ; and so I tell yer . '
Parsing [sent. 7626 len. 30]: ` That 's not the smallest danger in it -- not the very smallest , ' said the Jew ; ` it 's only to dodge a woman . '
Parsing [sent. 7627 len. 6]: ` An old woman ? '
Parsing [sent. 7628 len. 5]: demanded Mr. Bolter . '
Parsing [sent. 7629 len. 9]: A young one , ' replied Fagin . '
Parsing [sent. 7630 len. 15]: I can do that pretty well , I know , ' said Bolter . '
Parsing [sent. 7631 len. 12]: I was a regular cunning sneak when I was at school .
Parsing [sent. 7632 len. 8]: What am I to dodge her for ?
Parsing [sent. 7633 len. 64]: Not to -- ' ` Not to do anything , but to tell me where she goes , who she sees , and , if possible , what she says ; to remember the street , if it is a street , or the house , if it is a house ; and to bring me back all the information you can . '
Parsing [sent. 7634 len. 8]: ` What 'll yer give me ? '
Parsing [sent. 7635 len. 19]: asked Noah , setting down his cup , and looking his employer , eagerly , in the face .
Parsing [sent. 7636 len. 13]: ` If you do it well , a pound , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 7637 len. 19]: One pound , ' said Fagin , wishing to interest him in the scent as much as possible .
Parsing [sent. 7638 len. 26]: ` And that 's what I never gave yet , for any job of work where there was n't valuable consideration to be gained . '
Parsing [sent. 7639 len. 6]: ` Who is she ? '
Parsing [sent. 7640 len. 3]: inquired Noah .
Parsing [sent. 7641 len. 6]: ` One of us . '
Parsing [sent. 7642 len. 5]: ` Oh Lor ! '
Parsing [sent. 7643 len. 8]: cried Noah , curling up his nose .
Parsing [sent. 7644 len. 10]: ` Yer doubtful of her , are yer ? '
Parsing [sent. 7645 len. 25]: ` She had found out some new friends , my dear , and I must know who they are , ' replied Fagin . '
Parsing [sent. 7646 len. 7]: I see , ' said Noah .
Parsing [sent. 7647 len. 18]: ` Just to have the pleasure of knowing them , if they 're respectable people , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 7648 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 7649 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 7650 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 7651 len. 7]: I 'm your man . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7652 len. 18]: I knew you would be , ' cried Fagin , eleated by the success of his proposal .
Parsing [sent. 7653 len. 11]: ` Of course , of course , ' replied Noah .
Parsing [sent. 7654 len. 5]: ` Where is she ?
Parsing [sent. 7655 len. 8]: Where am I to wait for her ?
Parsing [sent. 7656 len. 7]: Where am I to go ? '
Parsing [sent. 7657 len. 13]: ` All that , my dear , you shall hear from me .
Parsing [sent. 7658 len. 14]: I 'll point her out at the proper time , ' said Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7659 len. 13]: ` You keep ready , and leave the rest to me . '
Parsing [sent. 7660 len. 34]: That night , and the next , and the next again , the spy sat booted and equipped in his carter 's dress : ready to turn out at a word from Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7661 len. 31]: Six nights passed -- six long weary nights -- and on each , Fagin came home with a disappointed face , and briefly intimated that it was not yet time .
Parsing [sent. 7662 len. 17]: On the seventh , he returned earlier , and with an exultation he could not conceal .
Parsing [sent. 7663 len. 4]: It was Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 7664 len. 44]: ` She goes abroad to-night , ' said Fagin , ` and on the right errand , I 'm sure ; for she has been alone all day , and the man she is afraid of will not be back much before daybreak .
Parsing [sent. 7665 len. 4]: Come with me .
Parsing [sent. 7666 len. 3]: Quick ! '
Parsing [sent. 7667 len. 24]: Noah started up without saying a word ; for the Jew was in a state of such intense excitement that it infected him .
Parsing [sent. 7668 len. 42]: They left the house stealthily , and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets , arrived at length before a public-house , which Noah recognised as the same in which he had slept , on the night of his arrival in London .
Parsing [sent. 7669 len. 12]: It was past eleven o'clock , and the door was closed .
Parsing [sent. 7670 len. 13]: It opened softly on its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle .
Parsing [sent. 7671 len. 14]: They entered , without noise ; and the door was closed behind them .
Parsing [sent. 7672 len. 48]: Scarcely venturing to whisper , but substituting dumb show for words , Fagin , and the young Jew who had admitted them , pointed out the pane of glass to Noah , and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in the adjoining room .
Parsing [sent. 7673 len. 7]: ` Is that the woman ? '
Parsing [sent. 7674 len. 8]: he asked , scarcely above his breath .
Parsing [sent. 7675 len. 5]: Fagin nodded yes . '
Parsing [sent. 7676 len. 12]: I ca n't see her face well , ' whispered Noah .
Parsing [sent. 7677 len. 13]: ` She is looking down , and the candle is behind her .
Parsing [sent. 7678 len. 8]: ` Stay there , ' whispered Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7679 len. 8]: He signed to Barney , who withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 7680 len. 42]: In an instant , the lad entered the room adjoining , and , under pretence of snuffing the candle , moved it in the required position , and , speaking to the girl , caused her to raise her face . '
Parsing [sent. 7681 len. 10]: I see her now , ' cried the spy .
Parsing [sent. 7682 len. 5]: ` Plainly ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7683 len. 9]: I should know her among a thousand . '
Parsing [sent. 7684 len. 15]: He hastily descended , as the room-door opened , and the girl came out .
Parsing [sent. 7685 len. 41]: Fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off , and they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place of concealment , and emerged by the door at which they had entered .
Parsing [sent. 7686 len. 4]: ` Hist ! '
Parsing [sent. 7687 len. 8]: cried the lad who held the door .
Parsing [sent. 7688 len. 4]: ` Dow . '
Parsing [sent. 7689 len. 11]: Noah exchanged a look with Fagin , and darted out .
Parsing [sent. 7690 len. 24]: ` To the left , ' whispered the lad ; ` take the left had , and keep od the other side . '
Parsing [sent. 7691 len. 27]: He did so ; and , by the light of the lamps , saw the girl 's retreating figure , already at some distance before him .
Parsing [sent. 7692 len. 26]: He advanced as near as he considered prudent , and kept on the opposite side of the street , the better to observe her motions .
Parsing [sent. 7693 len. 26]: She looked nervously round , twice or thrice , and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind her , pass on .
Parsing [sent. 7694 len. 19]: She seemed to gather courage as she advanced , and to walk with a steadier and firmer step .
Parsing [sent. 7695 len. 19]: The spy preserved the same relative distance between them , and followed : with his eye upon her .
Parsing [sent. 7696 len. 22]: CHAPTER XLVI THE APPOINTMENT KEPT The church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven , as two figures emerged on London Bridge .
Parsing [sent. 7697 len. 95]: One , which advanced with a swift and rapid step , was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in quest of some expected object ; the other figure was that of a man , who slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find , and , at some distance , accommodated his pace to hers : stopping when she stopped : and as she moved again , creeping stealthily on : but never allowing himself , in the ardour of his pursuit , to gain upon her footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 7698 len. 32]: Thus , they crossed the bridge , from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore , when the woman , apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the foot-passengers , turned back .
Parsing [sent. 7699 len. 58]: The movement was sudden ; but he who watched her , was not thrown off his guard by it ; for , shrinking into one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge , and leaning over the parapet the better to conceal his figure , he suffered her to pass on the opposite pavement .
Parsing [sent. 7700 len. 25]: When she was about the same distance in advance as she had been before , he slipped quietly down , and followed her again .
Parsing [sent. 7701 len. 11]: At nearly the centre of the bridge , she stopped .
Parsing [sent. 7702 len. 5]: The man stopped too .
Parsing [sent. 7703 len. 7]: It was a very dark night .
Parsing [sent. 7704 len. 18]: The day had been unfavourable , and at that hour and place there were few people stirring .
Parsing [sent. 7705 len. 32]: Such as there were , hurried quickly past : very possibly without seeing , but certainly without noticing , either the woman , or the man who kept her in view .
Parsing [sent. 7706 len. 62]: Their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards of such of London 's destitute population , as chanced to take their way over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless hovel wherein to lay their heads ; they stood there in silence : neither speaking nor spoken to , by any one who passed .
Parsing [sent. 7707 len. 39]: A mist hung over the river , deepening the red glare of the fires that burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs , and rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks .
Parsing [sent. 7708 len. 35]: The old smoke-stained storehouses on either side , rose heavy and dull from the dense mass of roofs and gables , and frowned sternly upon water too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes .
Parsing [sent. 7709 len. 55]: The tower of old Saint Saviour 's Church , and the spire of Saint Magnus , so long the giant-warders of the ancient bridge , were visible in the gloom ; but the forest of shipping below bridge , and the thickly scattered spires of churches above , were nearly all hidden from sight .
Parsing [sent. 7710 len. 36]: The girl had taken a few restless turns to and fro -- closely watched meanwhile by her hidden observer -- when the heavy bell of St. Paul 's tolled for the death of another day .
Parsing [sent. 7711 len. 8]: Midnight had come upon the crowded city .
Parsing [sent. 7712 len. 44]: The palace , the night-cellar , the jail , the madhouse : the chambers of birth and death , of health and sickness , the rigid face of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child : midnight was upon them all .
Parsing [sent. 7713 len. 43]: The hour had not struck two minutes , when a young lady , accompanied by a grey-haired gentleman , alighted from a hackney-carriage within a short distance of the bridge , and , having dismissed the vehicle , walked straight towards it .
Parsing [sent. 7714 len. 20]: They had scarcely set foot upon its pavement , when the girl started , and immediately made towards them .
Parsing [sent. 7715 len. 36]: They walked onward , looking about them with the air of persons who entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of being realised , when they were suddenly joined by this new associate .
Parsing [sent. 7716 len. 37]: They halted with an exclamation of surprise , but suppressed it immediately ; for a man in the garments of a countryman came close up -- brushed against them , indeed -- at that precise moment .
Parsing [sent. 7717 len. 19]: ` Not here , ' said Nancy hurriedly , ' I am afraid to speak to you here .
Parsing [sent. 7718 len. 15]: Come away -- out of the public road -- down the steps yonder ! '
Parsing [sent. 7719 len. 43]: As she uttered these words , and indicated , with her hand , the direction in which she wished them to proceed , the countryman looked round , and roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for , passed on .
Parsing [sent. 7720 len. 39]: The steps to which the girl had pointed , were those which , on the Surrey bank , and on the same side of the bridge as Saint Saviour 's Church , form a landing-stairs from the river .
Parsing [sent. 7721 len. 31]: To this spot , the man bearing the appearance of a countryman , hastened unobserved ; and after a moment 's survey of the place , he began to descend .
Parsing [sent. 7722 len. 15]: These stairs are a part of the bridge ; they consist of three flights .
Parsing [sent. 7723 len. 27]: Just below the end of the second , going down , the stone wall on the left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the Thames .
Parsing [sent. 7724 len. 40]: At this point the lower steps widen : so that a person turning that angle of the wall , is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who chance to be above him , if only a step .
Parsing [sent. 7725 len. 80]: The countryman looked hastily round , when he reached this point ; and as there seemed no better place of concealment , and , the tide being out , there was plenty of room , he slipped aside , with his back to the pilaster , and there waited : pretty certain that they would come no lower , and that even if he could not hear what was said , he could follow them again , with safety .
Parsing [sent. 7726 len. 72]: So tardily stole the time in this lonely place , and so eager was the spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he had been led to expect , that he more than once gave the matter up for lost , and persuaded himself , either that they had stopped far above , or had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious conversation .
Parsing [sent. 7727 len. 36]: He was on the point of emerging from his hiding-place , and regaining the road above , when he heard the sound of footsteps , and directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear .
Parsing [sent. 7728 len. 17]: He drew himself straight upright against the wall , and , scarcely breathing , listened attentively .
Parsing [sent. 7729 len. 20]: ` This is far enough , ' said a voice , which was evidently that of the gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 7730 len. 12]: I will not suffer the young lady to go any farther .
Parsing [sent. 7731 len. 26]: Many people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far , but you see I am willing to humour you . '
Parsing [sent. 7732 len. 6]: ` To humour me ! '
Parsing [sent. 7733 len. 11]: cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed .
Parsing [sent. 7734 len. 9]: ` You 're considerate , indeed , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7735 len. 4]: To humour me !
Parsing [sent. 7736 len. 10]: Well , well , it 's no matter . '
Parsing [sent. 7737 len. 29]: ` Why , for what , ' said the gentleman in a kinder tone , ` for what purpose can you have brought us to this strange place ?
Parsing [sent. 7738 len. 36]: Why not have let me speak to you , above there , where it is light , and there is something stirring , instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7739 len. 20]: I told you before , ' replied Nancy , ` that I was afraid to speak to you there .
Parsing [sent. 7740 len. 35]: I do n't know why it is , ' said the girl , shuddering , ` but I have such a fear and dread upon me to-night that I can hardly stand . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7741 len. 6]: A fear of what ? '
Parsing [sent. 7742 len. 11]: asked the gentleman , who seemed to pity her . '
Parsing [sent. 7743 len. 12]: I scarcely know of what , ' replied the girl . '
Parsing [sent. 7744 len. 5]: I wish I did .
Parsing [sent. 7745 len. 34]: Horrible thoughts of death , and shrouds with blood upon them , and a fear that has made me burn as if I was on fire , have been upon me all day .
Parsing [sent. 7746 len. 23]: I was reading a book to-night , to wile the time away , and the same things came into the print . '
Parsing [sent. 7747 len. 11]: ` Imagination , ' said the gentleman , soothing her .
Parsing [sent. 7748 len. 13]: ` No imagination , ' replied the girl in a hoarse voice .
Parsing [sent. 7749 len. 38]: ` I 'll swear I saw `` coffin '' written in every page of the book in large black letters , -- aye , and they carried one close to me , in the streets to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 7750 len. 13]: ` There is nothing unusual in that , ' said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 7751 len. 8]: ` They have passed me often . '
Parsing [sent. 7752 len. 9]: ` REAL ONES , ' rejoined the girl .
Parsing [sent. 7753 len. 6]: ` This was not . '
Parsing [sent. 7754 len. 33]: There was something so uncommon in her manner , that the flesh of the concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words , and the blood chilled within him .
Parsing [sent. 7755 len. 38]: He had never experienced a greater relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged her to be calm , and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful fancies .
Parsing [sent. 7756 len. 15]: ` Speak to her kindly , ' said the young lady to her companion .
Parsing [sent. 7757 len. 4]: ` Poor creature !
Parsing [sent. 7758 len. 7]: She seems to need it . '
Parsing [sent. 7759 len. 31]: ` Your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me as I am to-night , and preached of flames and vengeance , ' cried the girl .
Parsing [sent. 7760 len. 58]: ` Oh , dear lady , why ar 'n' t those who claim to be God 's own folks as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you , who , having youth , and beauty , and all that they have lost , might be a little proud instead of so much humbler ? '
Parsing [sent. 7761 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 7762 len. 5]: said the gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 7763 len. 55]: A Turk turns his face , after washing it well , to the East , when he says his prayers ; these good people , after giving their faces such a rub against the World as to take the smiles off , turn with no less regularity , to the darkest side of Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 7764 len. 14]: Between the Mussulman and the Pharisee , commend me to the first ! '
Parsing [sent. 7765 len. 26]: These words appeared to be addressed to the young lady , and were perhaps uttered with the view of afffording Nancy time to recover herself .
Parsing [sent. 7766 len. 11]: The gentleman , shortly afterwards , addressed himself to her .
Parsing [sent. 7767 len. 14]: ` You were not here last Sunday night , ' he said . '
Parsing [sent. 7768 len. 17]: I could n't come , ' replied Nancy ; ' I was kept by force . '
Parsing [sent. 7769 len. 5]: ` By whom ? '
Parsing [sent. 7770 len. 12]: ` Him that I told the young lady of before . '
Parsing [sent. 7771 len. 25]: ` You were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the subject which has brought us here to-night , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 7772 len. 5]: asked the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 7773 len. 12]: ` No , ' replied the girl , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 7774 len. 31]: ` It 's not very easy for me to leave him unless he knows why ; I could n't give him a drink of laudanum before I came away . '
Parsing [sent. 7775 len. 9]: ` Did he awake before you returned ? '
Parsing [sent. 7776 len. 4]: inquired the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 7777 len. 14]: ` No ; and neither he nor any of them suspect me . '
Parsing [sent. 7778 len. 8]: ` Good , ' said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 7779 len. 8]: ` Now listen to me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7780 len. 16]: I am ready , ' replied the girl , as he paused for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 7781 len. 36]: ` This young lady , ' the gentleman began , ` has communicated to me , and to some other friends who can be safely trusted , what you told her nearly a fortnight since .
Parsing [sent. 7782 len. 31]: I confess to you that I had doubts , at first , whether you were to be implicitly relied upon , but now I firmly believe you are . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7783 len. 10]: I am , ' said the girl earnestly . '
Parsing [sent. 7784 len. 8]: I repeat that I firmly believe it .
Parsing [sent. 7785 len. 39]: To prove to you that I am disposed to trust you , I tell you without reserve , that we propose to extort the secret , whatever it may be , from the fear of this man Monks .
Parsing [sent. 7786 len. 39]: But if -- if -- ' said the gentleman , ` he can not be secured , or , if secured , can not be acted upon as we wish , you must deliver up the Jew . '
Parsing [sent. 7787 len. 10]: ` Fagin , ' cried the girl , recoiling .
Parsing [sent. 7788 len. 16]: ` That man must be delivered up by you , ' said the gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 7789 len. 6]: I will not do it !
Parsing [sent. 7790 len. 7]: I will never do it ! '
Parsing [sent. 7791 len. 4]: replied the girl .
Parsing [sent. 7792 len. 24]: ` Devil that he is , and worse than devil as he has been to me , I will never do that . '
Parsing [sent. 7793 len. 6]: ` You will not ? '
Parsing [sent. 7794 len. 12]: said the gentleman , who seemed fully prepared for this answer .
Parsing [sent. 7795 len. 4]: ` Never ! '
Parsing [sent. 7796 len. 4]: returned the girl .
Parsing [sent. 7797 len. 6]: ` Tell me why ? '
Parsing [sent. 7798 len. 106]: ` For one reason , ' rejoined the girl firmly , ` for one reason , that the lady knows and will stand by me in , I know she will , for I have her promise : and for this other reason , besides , that , bad life as he has led , I have led a bad life too ; there are many of us who have kept the same courses together , and I 'll not turn upon them , who might -- any of them -- have turned upon me , but did n't , bad as they are . '
Parsing [sent. 7799 len. 41]: ` Then , ' said the gentleman , quickly , as if this had been the point he had been aiming to attain ; ` put Monks into my hands , and leave him to me to deal with . '
Parsing [sent. 7800 len. 11]: ` What if he turns against the others ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7801 len. 58]: I promise you that in that case , if the truth is forced from him , there the matter will rest ; there must be circumstances in Oliver 's little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye , and if the truth is once elicited , they shall go scot free . '
Parsing [sent. 7802 len. 8]: ` And if it is not ? '
Parsing [sent. 7803 len. 4]: suggested the girl .
Parsing [sent. 7804 len. 21]: ` Then , ' pursued the gentleman , ` this Fagin shall not be brought to justice without your consent .
Parsing [sent. 7805 len. 22]: In such a case I could show you reasons , I think , which would induce you to yield it . '
Parsing [sent. 7806 len. 11]: ` Have I the lady 's promise for that ? '
Parsing [sent. 7807 len. 4]: asked the girl .
Parsing [sent. 7808 len. 8]: ` You have , ' replied Rose .
Parsing [sent. 7809 len. 8]: ` My true and faithful pledge . '
Parsing [sent. 7810 len. 13]: ` Monks would never learn how you knew what you do ? '
Parsing [sent. 7811 len. 9]: said the girl , after a short pause .
Parsing [sent. 7812 len. 8]: ` Never , ' replied the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 7813 len. 20]: ` The intelligence should be brought to bear upon him , that he could never even guess . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7814 len. 33]: I have been a liar , and among liars from a little child , ' said the girl after another interval of silence , ` but I will take your words . '
Parsing [sent. 7815 len. 57]: After receving an assurance from both , that she might safely do so , she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the listener to discover even the purport of what she said , to describe , by name and situation , the public-house whence she had been followed that night .
Parsing [sent. 7816 len. 26]: From the manner in which she occasionally paused , it appeared as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she communicated .
Parsing [sent. 7817 len. 64]: When she had thoroughly explained the localities of the place , the best position from which to watch it without exciting observation , and the night and hour on which Monks was most in the habit of frequenting it , she seemed to consider for a few moments , for the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to her recollection .
Parsing [sent. 7818 len. 49]: ` He is tall , ' said the girl , ` and a strongly made man , but not stout ; he has a lurking walk ; and as he walks , constantly looks over his shoulder , first on one side , and then on the other .
Parsing [sent. 7819 len. 32]: Do n't forget that , for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other man 's , that you might almost tell him by that alone .
Parsing [sent. 7820 len. 30]: His face is dark , like his hair and eyes ; and , although he ca n't be more than six or eight and twenty , withered and haggard .
Parsing [sent. 7821 len. 37]: His lips are often discoloured and disfigured with the marks of teeth ; for he has desperate fits , and sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with wounds -- why did you start ? '
Parsing [sent. 7822 len. 7]: said the girl , stopping suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 7823 len. 25]: The gentleman replied , in a hurried manner , that he was not conscious of having done so , and begged her to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 7824 len. 46]: ` Part of this , ' said the girl , ' I have drawn out from other people at the house I tell you of , for I have only seen him twice , and both times he was covered up in a large cloak .
Parsing [sent. 7825 len. 14]: I think that 's all I can give you to know him by .
Parsing [sent. 7826 len. 7]: Stay though , ' she added .
Parsing [sent. 7827 len. 41]: ` Upon his throat : so high that you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his face : there is -- ' ' A broad red mark , like a burn or scald ? '
Parsing [sent. 7828 len. 4]: cried the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 7829 len. 6]: ` How 's this ? '
Parsing [sent. 7830 len. 4]: said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 7831 len. 6]: ` You know him ! '
Parsing [sent. 7832 len. 28]: The young lady uttered a cry of surprise , and for a few moments they were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe . '
Parsing [sent. 7833 len. 14]: I think I do , ' said the gentleman , breaking silence . '
Parsing [sent. 7834 len. 6]: I should by your description .
Parsing [sent. 7835 len. 4]: We shall see .
Parsing [sent. 7836 len. 8]: Many people are singularly like each other .
Parsing [sent. 7837 len. 8]: It may not be the same . '
Parsing [sent. 7838 len. 45]: As he expressed himself to this effect , with assumed carelessness , he took a step or two nearer the concealed spy , as the latter could tell from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter , ` It must be he ! '
Parsing [sent. 7839 len. 48]: ` Now , ' he said , returning : so it seemed by the sound : to the spot where he had stood before , ` you have given us most valuable assistance , young woman , and I wish you to be the better for it .
Parsing [sent. 7840 len. 9]: What can I do to serve you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7841 len. 7]: ` Nothing , ' replied Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 7842 len. 33]: ` You will not persist in saying that , ' rejoined the gentleman , with a voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder and more obdurate heart .
Parsing [sent. 7843 len. 4]: ` Think now .
Parsing [sent. 7844 len. 4]: Tell me . '
Parsing [sent. 7845 len. 12]: ` Nothing , sir , ' rejoined the girl , weeping .
Parsing [sent. 7846 len. 9]: ` You can do nothing to help me .
Parsing [sent. 7847 len. 9]: I am past all hope , indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 7848 len. 13]: ` You put yourself beyond its pale , ' said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 7849 len. 43]: ` The past has been a dreary waste with you , of youthful energies mis-spent , and such priceless treasures lavished , as the Creator bestows but once and never grants again , but , for the future , you may hope .
Parsing [sent. 7850 len. 70]: I do not say that it is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind , for that must come as you seek it ; but a quiet asylum , either in England , or , if you fear to remain here , in some foreign country , it is not only within the compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you .
Parsing [sent. 7851 len. 55]: Before the dawn of morning , before this river wakes to the first glimpse of day-light , you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your former associates , and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind you , as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment .
Parsing [sent. 7852 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 7853 len. 38]: I would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion , or take one look at any old haunt , or breathe the very air which is pestilence and death to you .
Parsing [sent. 7854 len. 12]: Quit them all , while there is time and opportunity ! '
Parsing [sent. 7855 len. 13]: ` She will be persuaded now , ' cried the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 7856 len. 10]: ` She hesitates , I am sure . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7857 len. 12]: I fear not , my dear , ' said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 7858 len. 19]: ` No sir , I do not , ' replied the girl , after a short struggle . '
Parsing [sent. 7859 len. 8]: I am chained to my old life .
Parsing [sent. 7860 len. 14]: I loathe and hate it now , but I can not leave it .
Parsing [sent. 7861 len. 38]: I must have gone too far to turn back , -- and yet I do n't know , for if you had spoken to me so , some time ago , I should have laughed it off .
Parsing [sent. 7862 len. 18]: But , ' she said , looking hastily round , ` this fear comes over me again .
Parsing [sent. 7863 len. 6]: I must go home . '
Parsing [sent. 7864 len. 4]: ` Home ! '
Parsing [sent. 7865 len. 12]: repeated the young lady , with great stress upon the word .
Parsing [sent. 7866 len. 10]: ` Home , lady , ' rejoined the girl .
Parsing [sent. 7867 len. 19]: ` To such a home as I have raised for myself with the work of my whole life .
Parsing [sent. 7868 len. 4]: Let us part .
Parsing [sent. 7869 len. 7]: I shall be watched or seen .
Parsing [sent. 7870 len. 2]: Go !
Parsing [sent. 7871 len. 2]: Go !
Parsing [sent. 7872 len. 26]: If I have done you any service all I ask is , that you leave me , and let me go my way alone . '
Parsing [sent. 7873 len. 14]: ` It is useless , ' said the gentleman , with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 7874 len. 12]: ` We compromise her safety , perhaps , by staying here .
Parsing [sent. 7875 len. 12]: We may have detained her longer than she expected already . '
Parsing [sent. 7876 len. 10]: ` Yes , yes , ' urged the girl .
Parsing [sent. 7877 len. 5]: ` You have . '
Parsing [sent. 7878 len. 9]: ` What , ' cried the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 7879 len. 13]: ` can be the end of this poor creature 's life ! '
Parsing [sent. 7880 len. 4]: ` What ! '
Parsing [sent. 7881 len. 4]: repeated the girl .
Parsing [sent. 7882 len. 7]: ` Look before you , lady .
Parsing [sent. 7883 len. 6]: Look at that dark water .
Parsing [sent. 7884 len. 30]: How many times do you read of such as I who spring into the tide , and leave no living thing , to care for , or bewail them .
Parsing [sent. 7885 len. 23]: It may be years hence , or it may be only months , but I shall come to that at last . '
Parsing [sent. 7886 len. 16]: ` Do not speak thus , pray , ' returned the young lady , sobbing .
Parsing [sent. 7887 len. 19]: ` It will never reach your ears , dear lady , and God forbid such horrors should ! '
Parsing [sent. 7888 len. 4]: replied the girl .
Parsing [sent. 7889 len. 6]: ` Good-night , good-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 7890 len. 5]: The gentleman turned away .
Parsing [sent. 7891 len. 10]: ` This purse , ' cried the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 7892 len. 22]: ` Take it for my sake , that you may have some resource in an hour of need and trouble . '
Parsing [sent. 7893 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 7894 len. 5]: replied the girl . '
Parsing [sent. 7895 len. 8]: I have not done this for money .
Parsing [sent. 7896 len. 8]: Let me have that to think of .
Parsing [sent. 7897 len. 46]: And yet -- give me something that you have worn : I should like to have something -- no , no , not a ring -- your gloves or handkerchief -- anything that I can keep , as having belonged to you , sweet lady .
Parsing [sent. 7898 len. 2]: There .
Parsing [sent. 7899 len. 3]: Bless you !
Parsing [sent. 7900 len. 4]: God bless you .
Parsing [sent. 7901 len. 5]: Good-night , good-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 7902 len. 35]: The violent agitation of the girl , and the apprehension of some discovery which would subject her to ill-usage and violence , seemed to determine the gentleman to leave her , as she requested .
Parsing [sent. 7903 len. 12]: The sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased .
Parsing [sent. 7904 len. 17]: The two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards appeared upon the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 7905 len. 9]: They stopped at the summit of the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 7906 len. 4]: ` Hark ! '
Parsing [sent. 7907 len. 7]: cried the young lady , listening .
Parsing [sent. 7908 len. 5]: ` Did she call !
Parsing [sent. 7909 len. 8]: I thought I heard her voice . '
Parsing [sent. 7910 len. 15]: ` No , my love , ' replied Mr. Brownlow , looking sadly back .
Parsing [sent. 7911 len. 15]: ` She has not moved , and will not till we are gone . '
Parsing [sent. 7912 len. 24]: Rose Maylie lingered , but the old gentleman drew her arm through his , and led her , with gentle force , away .
Parsing [sent. 7913 len. 31]: As they disappeared , the girl sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs , and vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears .
Parsing [sent. 7914 len. 16]: After a time she arose , and with feeble and tottering steps ascended the street .
Parsing [sent. 7915 len. 57]: The astonished listener remained motionless on his post for some minutes afterwards , and having ascertained , with many cautious glances round him , that he was again alone , crept slowly from his hiding-place , and returned , stealthily and in the shade of the wall , in the same manner as he had descended .
Parsing [sent. 7916 len. 46]: Peeping out , more than once , when he reached the top , to make sure that he was unobserved , Noah Claypole darted away at his utmost speed , and made for the Jew 's house as fast as his legs would carry him .
Parsing [sent. 7917 len. 114]: CHAPTER XLVII FATAL CONSEQUENCES It was nearly two hours before day-break ; that time which in the autumn of the year , may be truly called the dead of night ; when the streets are silent and deserted ; when even sounds appear to slumber , and profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream ; it was at this still and silent hour , that Fagin sat watching in his old lair , with face so distorted and pale , and eyes so red and blood-shot , that he looked less like a man , than like some hideous phantom , moist from the grave , and worried by an evil spirit .
Parsing [sent. 7918 len. 32]: He sat crouching over a cold hearth , wrapped in an old torn coverlet , with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table by his side .
Parsing [sent. 7919 len. 44]: His right hand was raised to his lips , and as , absorbed in thought , he hit his long black nails , he disclosed among his toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dog 's or rat 's .
Parsing [sent. 7920 len. 15]: Stretched upon a mattress on the floor , lay Noah Claypole , fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 7921 len. 52]: Towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant , and then brought them back again to the candle ; which with a long-burnt wick drooping almost double , and hot grease falling down in clots upon the table , plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 7922 len. 4]: Indeed they were .
Parsing [sent. 7923 len. 105]: Mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme ; hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers ; and utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up ; bitter disappointment at the loss of his revenge on Sikes ; the fear of detection , and ruin , and death ; and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by all ; these were the passionate considerations which , following close upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl , shot through the brain of Fagin , as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his heart .
Parsing [sent. 7924 len. 35]: He sat without changing his attitude in the least , or appearing to tkae the smallest heed of time , until his quick ear seemed to be attracted by a footstep in the street .
Parsing [sent. 7925 len. 15]: ` At last , ' he muttered , wiping his dry and fevered mouth .
Parsing [sent. 7926 len. 5]: ` At last ! '
Parsing [sent. 7927 len. 8]: The bell rang gently as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 7928 len. 27]: He crept upstairs to the door , and presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin , who carried a bundle under one arm .
Parsing [sent. 7929 len. 18]: Sitting down and throwing back his outer coat , the man displayed the burly frame of Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 7930 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 7931 len. 10]: he said , laying the bundle on the table .
Parsing [sent. 7932 len. 15]: ` Take care of that , and do the most you can with it .
Parsing [sent. 7933 len. 21]: It 's been trouble enough to get ; I thought I should have been here , three hours ago . '
Parsing [sent. 7934 len. 21]: Fagin laid his hand upon the bundle , and locking it in the cupboard , sat down again without speaking .
Parsing [sent. 7935 len. 78]: But he did not take his eyes off the robber , for an instant , during this action ; and now that they sat over against each other , face to face , he looked fixedly at him , with his lips quivering so violently , and his face so altered by the emotions which had mastered him , that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back his chair , and surveyed him with a look of real affright .
Parsing [sent. 7936 len. 5]: ` Wot now ? '
Parsing [sent. 7937 len. 3]: cried Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 7938 len. 12]: ` Wot do you look at a man so for ? '
Parsing [sent. 7939 len. 33]: Fagin raised his right hand , and shook his trembling forefinger in the air ; but his passion was so great , that the power of speech was for the moment gone .
Parsing [sent. 7940 len. 4]: ` Damme ! '
Parsing [sent. 7941 len. 13]: said Sikes , feeling in his breast with a look of alarm .
Parsing [sent. 7942 len. 6]: ` He 's gone mad .
Parsing [sent. 7943 len. 8]: I must look to myself here . '
Parsing [sent. 7944 len. 13]: ` No , no , ' rejoined Fagin , finding his voice .
Parsing [sent. 7945 len. 13]: ` It 's not -- you 're not the person , Bill .
Parsing [sent. 7946 len. 12]: I 've no -- no fault to find with you . '
Parsing [sent. 7947 len. 12]: ` Oh , you have n't , have n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7948 len. 19]: said Sikes , looking sternly at him , and ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket .
Parsing [sent. 7949 len. 10]: ` That 's lucky -- for one of us .
Parsing [sent. 7950 len. 10]: Which one that is , do n't matter . '
Parsing [sent. 7951 len. 29]: ` I 've got that to tell you , Bill , ' said Fagin , drawing his chair nearer , ` will make you worse than me . '
Parsing [sent. 7952 len. 4]: ` Aye ? '
Parsing [sent. 7953 len. 8]: returned the robber with an incredulous air .
Parsing [sent. 7954 len. 4]: ` Tell away !
Parsing [sent. 7955 len. 12]: Look sharp , or Nance will think I 'm lost . '
Parsing [sent. 7956 len. 4]: ` Lost ! '
Parsing [sent. 7957 len. 3]: cried Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 7958 len. 16]: ` She has pretty well settled that , in her own mind , already . '
Parsing [sent. 7959 len. 37]: Sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the Jew 's face , and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there , clenched his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly .
Parsing [sent. 7960 len. 7]: ` Speak , will you ! '
Parsing [sent. 7961 len. 18]: he said ; ` or if you do n't , it shall be for want of breath .
Parsing [sent. 7962 len. 15]: Open your mouth and say wot you 've got to say in plain words .
Parsing [sent. 7963 len. 14]: Out with it , you thundering old cur , out with it ! '
Parsing [sent. 7964 len. 13]: ` Suppose that lad that 's laying there -- ' Fagin began .
Parsing [sent. 7965 len. 18]: Sikes turned round to where Noah was sleeping , as if he had not previously observed him .
Parsing [sent. 7966 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 7967 len. 8]: he said , resuming his former position .
Parsing [sent. 7968 len. 66]: ` Suppose that lad , ' pursued Fagin , ` was to peach -- to blow upon us all -- first seeking out the right folks for the purpose , and then having a meeting with 'em in the street to paint our likenesses , describe every mark that they might know us by , and the crib where we might be most easily taken .
Parsing [sent. 7969 len. 80]: Suppose he was to do all this , and besides to blow upon a plant we 've all been in , more or less -- of his own fancy ; not grabbed , trapped , tried , earwigged by the parson and brought to it on bread and water , -- but of his own fancy ; to please his own taste ; stealing out at nights to find those most interested against us , and peaching to them .
Parsing [sent. 7970 len. 6]: Do you hear me ? '
Parsing [sent. 7971 len. 10]: cried the Jew , his eyes flashing with rage .
Parsing [sent. 7972 len. 11]: ` Suppose he did all this , what then ? '
Parsing [sent. 7973 len. 5]: ` What then ! '
Parsing [sent. 7974 len. 8]: replied Sikes ; with a tremendous oath .
Parsing [sent. 7975 len. 35]: ` If he was left alive till I came , I 'd grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head . '
Parsing [sent. 7976 len. 8]: ` What if I did it ! '
Parsing [sent. 7977 len. 7]: cried Fagin almost in a yell .
Parsing [sent. 7978 len. 18]: ` I , that knows so much , and could hang so many besides myself ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7979 len. 20]: I do n't know , ' replied Sikes , clenching his teeth and turning white at the mere suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 7980 len. 47]: ` I 'd do something in the jail that ` ud get me put in irons ; and if I was tried along with you , I 'd fall upon you with them in the open court , and beat your brains out afore the people .
Parsing [sent. 7981 len. 34]: I should have such strength , ' muttered the robber , poising his brawny arm , ` that I could smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over it . '
Parsing [sent. 7982 len. 5]: ` You would ? '
Parsing [sent. 7983 len. 5]: ` Would I ! '
Parsing [sent. 7984 len. 4]: said the housebreaker .
Parsing [sent. 7985 len. 5]: ` Try me . '
Parsing [sent. 7986 len. 28]: ` If it was Charley , or the Dodger , or Bet , or -- ' ' I do n't care who , ' replied Sikes impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 7987 len. 13]: ` Whoever it was , I 'd serve them the same . '
Parsing [sent. 7988 len. 31]: Fagin looked hard at the robber ; and , motioning him to be silent , stooped over the bed upon the floor , and shook the sleeper to rouse him .
Parsing [sent. 7989 len. 31]: Sikes leant forward in his chair : looking on with his hands upon his knees , as if wondering much what all this questioning and preparation was to end in .
Parsing [sent. 7990 len. 5]: ` Bolter , Bolter !
Parsing [sent. 7991 len. 4]: Poor lad ! '
Parsing [sent. 7992 len. 20]: said Fagin , looking up with an expression of devilish anticipation , and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 7993 len. 21]: ` He 's tired -- tired with watching for her so long , -- watching for her , Bill . '
Parsing [sent. 7994 len. 6]: ` Wot d'ye mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 7995 len. 6]: asked Sikes , drawing back .
Parsing [sent. 7996 len. 19]: Fagin made no answer , but bending over the sleeper again , hauled him into a sitting posture .
Parsing [sent. 7997 len. 27]: When his assumed name had been repeated several times , Noah rubbed his eyes , and , giving a heavy yawn , looked sleepily about him .
Parsing [sent. 7998 len. 27]: ` Tell me that again -- once again , just for him to hear , ' said the Jew , pointing to Sikes as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 7999 len. 6]: ` Tell yer what ? '
Parsing [sent. 8000 len. 9]: asked the sleepy Noah , shaking himself pettishy .
Parsing [sent. 8001 len. 30]: ` That about -- NANCY , ' said Fagin , clutching Sikes by the wrist , as if to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough .
Parsing [sent. 8002 len. 6]: ` You followed her ? '
Parsing [sent. 8003 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 8004 len. 6]: ` To London Bridge ? '
Parsing [sent. 8005 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 8006 len. 8]: ` Where she met two people . '
Parsing [sent. 8007 len. 7]: ` So she did . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8008 len. 89]: A gentleman and a lady that she had gone to of her own accord before , who asked her to give up all her pals , and Monks first , which she did -- and to describe him , which she did -- and to tell her what house it was that we meet at , and go to , which she did -- and where it could be best watched from , which she did -- and what time the people went there , which she did .
Parsing [sent. 8009 len. 5]: She did all this .
Parsing [sent. 8010 len. 22]: She told it all every word without a threat , without a murmur -- she did -- did she not ? '
Parsing [sent. 8011 len. 8]: cried Fagin , half mad with fury .
Parsing [sent. 8012 len. 12]: ` All right , ' replied Noah , scratching his head .
Parsing [sent. 8013 len. 9]: ` That 's just what it was ! '
Parsing [sent. 8014 len. 11]: ` What did they say , about last Sunday ? '
Parsing [sent. 8015 len. 6]: ` About last Sunday ! '
Parsing [sent. 8016 len. 5]: replied Noah , considering .
Parsing [sent. 8017 len. 9]: ` Why I told yer that before . '
Parsing [sent. 8018 len. 3]: ` Again .
Parsing [sent. 8019 len. 5]: Tell it again ! '
Parsing [sent. 8020 len. 24]: cried Fagin , tightening his grasp on Sikes , and brandishing his other hand aloft , as the foam flew from his lips .
Parsing [sent. 8021 len. 44]: ` They asked her , ' said Noah , who , as he grew more wakeful , seemed to have a dawning perception who Sikes was , ` they asked her why she did n't come , last Sunday , as she promised .
Parsing [sent. 8022 len. 7]: She said she could n't . '
Parsing [sent. 8023 len. 5]: ` Why -- why ?
Parsing [sent. 8024 len. 5]: Tell him that . '
Parsing [sent. 8025 len. 24]: ` Because she was forcibly kept at home by Bill , the man she had told them of before , ' replied Noah .
Parsing [sent. 8026 len. 7]: ` What more of him ? '
Parsing [sent. 8027 len. 3]: cried Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 8028 len. 13]: ` What more of the man she had told them of before ?
Parsing [sent. 8029 len. 9]: Tell him that , tell him that . '
Parsing [sent. 8030 len. 43]: ` Why , that she could n't very easily get out of doors unless he knew where she was going to , ' said Noah ; ` and so the first time she went to see the lady , she -- ha !
Parsing [sent. 8031 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 8032 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 8033 len. 22]: it made me laugh when she said it , that it did -- she gave him a drink of laudanum . '
Parsing [sent. 8034 len. 6]: ` Hell 's fire ! '
Parsing [sent. 8035 len. 9]: cried Sikes , breaking fiercely from the Jew .
Parsing [sent. 8036 len. 6]: ` Let me go ! '
Parsing [sent. 8037 len. 24]: Flinging the old man from him , he rushed from the room , and darted , wildly and furiously , up the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 8038 len. 6]: ` Bill , Bill ! '
Parsing [sent. 8039 len. 8]: cried Fagin , following him hastily . '
Parsing [sent. 8040 len. 3]: A word .
Parsing [sent. 8041 len. 5]: Only a word . '
Parsing [sent. 8042 len. 36]: The word would not have been exchanged , but that the housebreaker was unable to open the door : on which he was expending fruitless oaths and violence , when the Jew came panting up .
Parsing [sent. 8043 len. 9]: ` Let me out , ' said Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 8044 len. 12]: ` Do n't speak to me ; it 's not safe .
Parsing [sent. 8045 len. 8]: Let me out , I say ! '
Parsing [sent. 8046 len. 18]: ` Hear me speak a word , ' rejoined Fagin , laying his hand upon the lock .
Parsing [sent. 8047 len. 15]: ` You wo n't be -- ' ` Well , ' replied the other .
Parsing [sent. 8048 len. 13]: ` You wo n't be -- too -- violent , Bill ? '
Parsing [sent. 8049 len. 20]: The day was breaking , and there was light enough for the men to see each other 's faces .
Parsing [sent. 8050 len. 23]: They exchanged one brief glance ; there was a fire in the eyes of both , which could not be mistaken . '
Parsing [sent. 8051 len. 24]: I mean , ' said Fagin , showing that he felt all disguise was now useless , ` not too violent for safety .
Parsing [sent. 8052 len. 11]: Be crafty , Bill , and not too bold . '
Parsing [sent. 8053 len. 26]: Sikes made no reply ; but , pulling open the door , of which Fagin had turned the lock , dashed into the silent streets .
Parsing [sent. 8054 len. 84]: Without one pause , or moment 's consideration ; without once turning his head to the right or left , or raising his eyes to the sky , or lowering them to the ground , but looking straight before him with savage resolution : his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw seemed starting through his skin ; the robber held on his headlong course , nor muttered a word , nor relaxed a muscle , until he reached his own door .
Parsing [sent. 8055 len. 42]: He opened it , softly , with a key ; strode lightly up the stairs ; and entering his own room , double-locked the door , and lifting a heavy table against it , drew back the curtain of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 8056 len. 10]: The girl was lying , half-dressed , upon it .
Parsing [sent. 8057 len. 19]: He had roused her from her sleep , for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look .
Parsing [sent. 8058 len. 5]: ` Get up ! '
Parsing [sent. 8059 len. 4]: said the man .
Parsing [sent. 8060 len. 8]: ` It is you , Bill ! '
Parsing [sent. 8061 len. 13]: said the girl , with an expression of pleasure at his return .
Parsing [sent. 8062 len. 9]: ` It is , ' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 8063 len. 5]: ` Get up . '
Parsing [sent. 8064 len. 23]: There was a candle burning , but the man hastily drew it from the candlestick , and hurled it under the grate .
Parsing [sent. 8065 len. 17]: Seeing the faint light of early day without , the girl rose to undraw the curtain .
Parsing [sent. 8066 len. 15]: ` Let it be , ' said Sikes , thrusting his hand before her .
Parsing [sent. 8067 len. 14]: ` There 's enough light for wot I 've got to do . '
Parsing [sent. 8068 len. 26]: ` Bill , ' said the girl , in the low voice of alarm , ` why do you look like that at me ! '
Parsing [sent. 8069 len. 53]: The robber sat regarding her , for a few seconds , with dilated nostrils and heaving breast ; and then , grasping her by the head and throat , dragged her into the middle of the room , and looking once towards the door , placed his heavy hand upon her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 8070 len. 6]: ` Bill , Bill ! '
Parsing [sent. 8071 len. 41]: gasped the girl , wrestling with the strength of mortal fear , -- ` I -- I wo n't scream or cry -- not once -- hear me -- speak to me -- tell me what I have done ! '
Parsing [sent. 8072 len. 9]: ` You know , you she devil ! '
Parsing [sent. 8073 len. 8]: returned the robber , suppressing his breath .
Parsing [sent. 8074 len. 14]: ` You were watched to-night ; every word you said was heard . '
Parsing [sent. 8075 len. 25]: ` Then spare my life for the love of Heaven , as I spared yours , ' rejoined the girl , clinging to him .
Parsing [sent. 8076 len. 16]: ` Bill , dear Bill , you can not have the heart to kill me .
Parsing [sent. 8077 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8078 len. 16]: think of all I have given up , only this one night , for you .
Parsing [sent. 8079 len. 27]: You SHALL have time to think , and save yourself this crime ; I will not loose my hold , you can not throw me off .
Parsing [sent. 8080 len. 24]: Bill , Bill , for dear God 's sake , for your own , for mine , stop before you spill my blood !
Parsing [sent. 8081 len. 15]: I have been true to you , upon my guilty soul I have ! '
Parsing [sent. 8082 len. 34]: The man struggled violently , to release his arms ; but those of the girl were clasped round his , and tear her as he would , he could not tear them away .
Parsing [sent. 8083 len. 46]: ` Bill , ' cried the girl , striving to lay her head upon his breast , ` the gentleman and that dear lady , told me to-night of a home in some foreign country where I could end my days in solitude and peace .
Parsing [sent. 8084 len. 58]: Let me see them again , and beg them , on my knees , to show the same mercy and goodness to you ; and let us both leave this dreadful place , and far apart lead better lives , and forget how we have lived , except in prayers , and never see each other more .
Parsing [sent. 8085 len. 8]: It is never too late to repent .
Parsing [sent. 8086 len. 23]: They told me so -- I feel it now -- but we must have time -- a little , little time ! '
Parsing [sent. 8087 len. 11]: The housebreaker freed one arm , and grasped his pistol .
Parsing [sent. 8088 len. 44]: The certainty of immediate detection if he fired , flashed across his mind even in the midst of his fury ; and he beat it twice with all the force he could summon , upon the upturned face that almost touched his own .
Parsing [sent. 8089 len. 75]: She staggered and fell : nearly blinded with the blood that rained down from a deep gash in her forehead ; but raising herself , with difficulty , on her knees , drew from her bosom a white handkerchief -- Rose Maylie 's own -- and holding it up , in her folded hands , as high towards Heaven as her feeble strength would allow , breathed one prayer for mercy to her Maker .
Parsing [sent. 8090 len. 9]: It was a ghastly figure to look upon .
Parsing [sent. 8091 len. 26]: The murderer staggering backward to the wall , and shutting out the sight with his hand , seized a heavy club and struck her down .
Parsing [sent. 8092 len. 37]: CHAPTER XLVIII THE FLIGHT OF SIKES Of all bad deeds that , under cover of the darkness , had been committed with wide London 's bounds since night hung over it , that was the worst .
Parsing [sent. 8093 len. 23]: Of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning air , that was the foulest and most cruel .
Parsing [sent. 8094 len. 38]: The sun -- the bright sun , that brings back , not light alone , but new life , and hope , and freshness to man -- burst upon the crowded city in clear and radiant glory .
Parsing [sent. 8095 len. 20]: Through costly-coloured glass and paper-mended window , through cathedral dome and rotten crevice , it shed its equal ray .
Parsing [sent. 8096 len. 11]: It lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay .
Parsing [sent. 8097 len. 3]: It did .
Parsing [sent. 8098 len. 13]: He tried to shut it out , but it would stream in .
Parsing [sent. 8099 len. 25]: If the sight had been a ghastly one in the dull morning , what was it , now , in all that brilliant light !
Parsing [sent. 8100 len. 12]: He had not moved ; he had been afraid to stir .
Parsing [sent. 8101 len. 26]: There had been a moan and motion of the hand ; and , with terror added to rage , he had struck and struck again .
Parsing [sent. 8102 len. 52]: Once he threw a rug over it ; but it was worse to fancy the eyes , and imagine them moving towards him , than to see them glaring upward , as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 8103 len. 7]: He had plucked it off again .
Parsing [sent. 8104 len. 23]: And there was the body -- mere flesh and blood , nor more -- but such flesh , and so much blood !
Parsing [sent. 8105 len. 16]: He struck a light , kindled a fire , and thrust the club into it .
Parsing [sent. 8106 len. 28]: There was hair upon the end , which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder , and , caught by the air , whirled up the chimney .
Parsing [sent. 8107 len. 35]: Even that frightened him , sturdy as he was ; but he held the weapon till it broke , and then piled it on the coals to burn away , and smoulder into ashes .
Parsing [sent. 8108 len. 29]: He washed himself , and rubbed his clothes ; there were spots that would not be removed , but he cut the pieces out , and burnt them .
Parsing [sent. 8109 len. 9]: How those stains were dispersed about the room !
Parsing [sent. 8110 len. 9]: The very feet of the dog were bloody .
Parsing [sent. 8111 len. 23]: All this time he had , never once , turned his back upon the corpse ; no , not for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 8112 len. 38]: Such preparations completed , he moved , backward , towards the door : dragging the dog with him , lest he should soil his feet anew and carry out new evidence of the crime into the streets .
Parsing [sent. 8113 len. 18]: He shut the door softly , locked it , took the key , and left the house .
Parsing [sent. 8114 len. 22]: He crossed over , and glanced up at the window , to be sure that nothing was visible from the outside .
Parsing [sent. 8115 len. 21]: There was the curtain still drawn , which she would have opened to admit the light she never saw again .
Parsing [sent. 8116 len. 6]: It lay nearly under there .
Parsing [sent. 8117 len. 4]: HE knew that .
Parsing [sent. 8118 len. 12]: God , how the sun poured down upon the very spot !
Parsing [sent. 8119 len. 5]: The glance was instantaneous .
Parsing [sent. 8120 len. 12]: It was a relief to have got free of the room .
Parsing [sent. 8121 len. 11]: He whistled on the dog , and walked rapidly away .
Parsing [sent. 8122 len. 73]: He went through Islington ; strode up the hill at Highgate on which stands the stone in honour of Whittington ; turned down to Highgate Hill , unsteady of purpose , and uncertain where to go ; struck off to the right again , almost as soon as he began to descend it ; and taking the foot-path across the fields , skirted Caen Wood , and so came on Hampstead Heath .
Parsing [sent. 8123 len. 58]: Traversing the hollow by the Vale of Heath , he mounted the opposite bank , and crossing the road which joins the villages of Hampstead and Highgate , made along the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at North End , in one of which he laid himself down under a hedge , and slept .
Parsing [sent. 8124 len. 78]: Soon he was up again , and away , -- not far into the country , but back towards London by the high-road -- then back again -- then over another part of the same ground as he already traversed -- then wandering up and down in fields , and lying on ditches ' brinks to rest , and starting up to make for some other spot , and do the same , and ramble on again .
Parsing [sent. 8125 len. 20]: Where could he go , that was near and not too public , to get some meat and drink ?
Parsing [sent. 8126 len. 2]: Hendon .
Parsing [sent. 8127 len. 18]: That was a good place , not far off , and out of most people 's way .
Parsing [sent. 8128 len. 37]: Thither he directed his steps , -- running sometimes , and sometimes , with a strange perversity , loitering at a snail 's pace , or stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick .
Parsing [sent. 8129 len. 26]: But when he got there , all the people he met -- the very children at the doors -- seemed to view him with suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 8130 len. 38]: Back he turned again , without the courage to purchase bit or drop , though he had tasted no food for many hours ; and once more he lingered on the Heath , uncertain where to go .
Parsing [sent. 8131 len. 18]: He wandered over miles and miles of ground , and still came back to the old place .
Parsing [sent. 8132 len. 40]: Morning and noon had passed , and the day was on the wane , and still he rambled to and fro , and up and down , and round and round , and still lingered about the same spot .
Parsing [sent. 8133 len. 13]: At last he got away , and shaped his course for Hatfield .
Parsing [sent. 8134 len. 62]: It was nine o'clock at night , when the man , quite tired out , and the dog , limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise , turned down the hill by the church of the quiet village , and plodding along the little street , crept into a small public-house , whose scanty light had guided them to the spot .
Parsing [sent. 8135 len. 16]: There was a fire in the tap-room , and some country-labourers were drinking before it .
Parsing [sent. 8136 len. 41]: They made room for the stranger , but he sat down in the furthest corner , and ate and drank alone , or rather with his dog : to whom he cast a morsel of food from time to time .
Parsing [sent. 8137 len. 98]: The conversation of the men assembled here , turned upon the neighboring land , and farmers ; and when those topics were exhausted , upon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous Sunday ; the young men present considering him very old , and the old men present declaring him to have been quite young -- not older , one white-haired grandfather said , than he was -- with ten or fifteen year of life in him at least -- if he had taken care ; if he had taken care .
Parsing [sent. 8138 len. 13]: There was nothing to attract attention , or excite alarm in this .
Parsing [sent. 8139 len. 36]: The robber , after paying his reckoning , sat silent and unnoticed in his corner , and had almost dropped asleep , when he was half wakened by the noisy entrance of a new comer .
Parsing [sent. 8140 len. 57]: This was an antic fellow , half pedlar and half mountebank , who travelled about the country on foot to vend hones , stops , razors , washballs , harness-paste , medicine for dogs and horses , cheap perfumery , cosmetics , and such-like wares , which he carried in a case slung to his back .
Parsing [sent. 8141 len. 40]: His entrance was the signal for various homely jokes with the countrymen , which slackened not until he had made his supper , and opened his box of treasures , when he ingeniously contrived to unite business with amusement .
Parsing [sent. 8142 len. 7]: ` And what be that stoof ?
Parsing [sent. 8143 len. 7]: Good to eat , Harry ? '
Parsing [sent. 8144 len. 13]: asked a grinning countryman , pointing to some composition-cakes in one corner .
Parsing [sent. 8145 len. 68]: ` This , ' said the fellow , producing one , ` this is the infallible and invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain , rust , dirt , mildew , spick , speck , spot , or spatter , from silk , satin , linen , cambrick , cloth , crape , stuff , carpet , merino , muslin , bombazeen , or woollen stuff .
Parsing [sent. 8146 len. 28]: Wine-stains , fruit-stains , beer-stains , water-stains , paint-stains , pitch-stains , any stains , all come out at one rub with the infallible and invaluable composition .
Parsing [sent. 8147 len. 27]: If a lady stains her honour , she has only need to swallow one cake and she 's cured at once -- for it 's poison .
Parsing [sent. 8148 len. 53]: If a gentleman wants to prove this , he has only need to bolt one little square , and he has put it beyond question -- for it 's quite as satisfactory as a pistol-bullet , and a great deal nastier in the flavour , consequently the more credit in taking it .
Parsing [sent. 8149 len. 5]: One penny a square .
Parsing [sent. 8150 len. 11]: With all these virtues , one penny a square ! '
Parsing [sent. 8151 len. 14]: There were two buyers directly , and more of the listeners plainly hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 8152 len. 9]: The vendor observing this , increased in loquacity .
Parsing [sent. 8153 len. 19]: ` It 's all bought up as fast as it can be made , ' said the fellow .
Parsing [sent. 8154 len. 64]: ` There are fourteen water-mills , six steam-engines , and a galvanic battery , always a-working upon it , and they ca n't make it fast enough , though the men work so hard that they die off , and the widows is pensioned directly , with twenty pound a-year for each of the children , and a premium of fifty for twins .
Parsing [sent. 8155 len. 5]: One penny a square !
Parsing [sent. 8156 len. 15]: Two half-pence is all the same , and four farthings is received with joy .
Parsing [sent. 8157 len. 5]: One penny a square !
Parsing [sent. 8158 len. 16]: Wine-stains , fruit-stains , beer-stains , water-stains , paint-stains , pitch-stains , mud-stains , blood-stains !
Parsing [sent. 8159 len. 31]: Here is a stain upon the hat of a gentleman in company , that I 'll take clean out , before he can order me a pint of ale . '
Parsing [sent. 8160 len. 4]: ` Hah ! '
Parsing [sent. 8161 len. 5]: cried Sikes starting up .
Parsing [sent. 8162 len. 6]: ` Give that back . '
Parsing [sent. 8163 len. 32]: ` I 'll take it clean out , sir , ' replied the man , winking to the company , ` before you can come across the room to get it .
Parsing [sent. 8164 len. 25]: Gentlemen all , observe the dark stain upon this gentleman 's hat , no wider than a shilling , but thicker than a half-crown .
Parsing [sent. 8165 len. 51]: Whether it is a wine-stain , fruit-stain , beer-stain , water-stain , paint-stain , pitch-stain , mud-stain , or blood-stain -- ' The man got no further , for Sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew the table , and tearing the hat from him , burst out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 8166 len. 90]: With the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened upon him , despite himself , all day , the murderer , finding that he was not followed , and that they most probably considered him some drunken sullen fellow , turned back up the town , and getting out of the glare of the lamps of a stage-coach that was standing in the street , was walking past , when he recognised the mail from London , and saw that it was standing at the little post-office .
Parsing [sent. 8167 len. 16]: He almost knew what was to come ; but he crossed over , and listened .
Parsing [sent. 8168 len. 13]: The guard was standing at the door , waiting for the letter-bag .
Parsing [sent. 8169 len. 27]: A man , dressed like a game-keeper , came up at the moment , and he handed him a basket which lay ready on the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 8170 len. 12]: ` That 's for your people , ' said the guard .
Parsing [sent. 8171 len. 11]: ` Now , look alive in there , will you .
Parsing [sent. 8172 len. 23]: Damn that ` ere bag , it war n't ready night afore last ; this wo n't do , you know ! '
Parsing [sent. 8173 len. 10]: ` Anything new up in town , Ben ? '
Parsing [sent. 8174 len. 17]: asked the game-keeper , drawing back to the window-shutters , the better to admire the horses .
Parsing [sent. 8175 len. 19]: ` No , nothing that I knows on , ' replied the man , pulling on his gloves .
Parsing [sent. 8176 len. 7]: ` Corn 's up a little .
Parsing [sent. 8177 len. 23]: I heerd talk of a murder , too , down Spitalfields way , but I do n't reckon much upon it . '
Parsing [sent. 8178 len. 22]: ` Oh , that 's quite true , ' said a gentleman inside , who was looking out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 8179 len. 9]: ` And a dreadful murder it was . '
Parsing [sent. 8180 len. 7]: ` Was it , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8181 len. 8]: rejoined the guard , touching his hat .
Parsing [sent. 8182 len. 11]: ` Man or woman , pray , sir ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8183 len. 8]: A woman , ' replied the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 8184 len. 17]: ` It is supposed -- ' ` Now , Ben , ' replied the coachman impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 8185 len. 22]: ` Damn that ` ere bag , ' said the guard ; ` are you gone to sleep in there ? '
Parsing [sent. 8186 len. 4]: ` Coming ! '
Parsing [sent. 8187 len. 8]: cried the office keeper , running out .
Parsing [sent. 8188 len. 8]: ` Coming , ' growled the guard .
Parsing [sent. 8189 len. 29]: ` Ah , and so 's the young ` ooman of property that 's going to take a fancy to me , but I do n't know when .
Parsing [sent. 8190 len. 5]: Here , give hold .
Parsing [sent. 8191 len. 6]: All ri -- ight ! '
Parsing [sent. 8192 len. 14]: The horn sounded a few cheerful notes , and the coach was gone .
Parsing [sent. 8193 len. 29]: Sikes remained standing in the street , apparently unmoved by what he had just heard , and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go .
Parsing [sent. 8194 len. 19]: At length he went back again , and took the road which leads from Hatfield to St. Albans .
Parsing [sent. 8195 len. 41]: He went on doggedly ; but as he left the town behind him , and plunged into the solitude and darkness of the road , he felt a dread and awe creeping upon him which shook him to the core .
Parsing [sent. 8196 len. 44]: Every object before him , substance or shadow , still or moving , took the semblance of some fearful thing ; but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that haunted him of that morning 's ghastly figure following at his heels .
Parsing [sent. 8197 len. 29]: He could trace its shadow in the gloom , supply the smallest item of the outline , and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along .
Parsing [sent. 8198 len. 23]: He could hear its garments rustling in the leaves , and every breath of wind came laden with that last low cry .
Parsing [sent. 8199 len. 8]: If he stopped it did the same .
Parsing [sent. 8200 len. 43]: If he ran , it followed -- not running too : that would have been a relief : but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life , and borne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell .
Parsing [sent. 8201 len. 50]: At times , he turned , with desperate determination , resolved to beat this phantom off , though it should look him dead ; but the hair rose on his head , and his blood stood still , for it had turned with him and was behind him then .
Parsing [sent. 8202 len. 17]: He had kept it before him that morning , but it was behind now -- always .
Parsing [sent. 8203 len. 23]: He leaned his back against a bank , and felt that it stood above him , visibly out against the cold night-sky .
Parsing [sent. 8204 len. 14]: He threw himself upon the road -- on his back upon the road .
Parsing [sent. 8205 len. 23]: At his head it stood , silent , erect , and still -- a living grave-stone , with its epitaph in blood .
Parsing [sent. 8206 len. 16]: Let no man talk of murderers escaping justice , and hint that Providence must sleep .
Parsing [sent. 8207 len. 17]: There were twenty score of violent deaths in one long minute of that agony of fear .
Parsing [sent. 8208 len. 17]: There was a shed in a field he passed , that offered shelter for the night .
Parsing [sent. 8209 len. 28]: Before the door , were three tall poplar trees , which made it very dark within ; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail .
Parsing [sent. 8210 len. 26]: He COULD NOT walk on , till daylight came again ; and here he stretched himself close to the wall -- to undergo new torture .
Parsing [sent. 8211 len. 22]: For now , a vision came before him , as constant and more terrible than that from which he had escaped .
Parsing [sent. 8212 len. 42]: Those widely staring eyes , so lustreless and so glassy , that he had better borne to see them than think upon them , appeared in the midst of the darkness : light in themselves , but giving light to nothing .
Parsing [sent. 8213 len. 10]: There were but two , but they were everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 8214 len. 42]: If he shut out the sight , there came the room with every well-known object -- some , indeed , that he would have forgotten , if he had gone over its contents from memory -- each in its accustomed place .
Parsing [sent. 8215 len. 20]: The body was in ITS place , and its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away .
Parsing [sent. 8216 len. 11]: He got up , and rushed into the field without .
Parsing [sent. 8217 len. 6]: The figure was behind him .
Parsing [sent. 8218 len. 11]: He re-entered the shed , and shrunk down once more .
Parsing [sent. 8219 len. 12]: The eyes were there , before he had laid himself along .
Parsing [sent. 8220 len. 52]: And here he remained in such terror as none but he can know , trembling in every limb , and the cold sweat starting from every pore , when suddenly there arose upon the night-wind the noise of distant shouting , and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder .
Parsing [sent. 8221 len. 24]: Any sound of men in that lonely place , even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm , was something to him .
Parsing [sent. 8222 len. 25]: He regained his strength and energy at the prospect of personal danger ; and springing to his feet , rushed into the open air .
Parsing [sent. 8223 len. 7]: The broad sky seemed on fire .
Parsing [sent. 8224 len. 40]: Rising into the air with showers of sparks , and rolling one above the other , were sheets of flame , lighting the atmosphere for miles round , and driving clouds of smoke in the direction where he stood .
Parsing [sent. 8225 len. 20]: The shouts grew louder as new voices swelled the roar , and he could hear the cry of Fire !
Parsing [sent. 8226 len. 36]: mingled with the ringing of an alarm-bell , the fall of heavy bodies , and the crackling of flames as they twined round some new obstacle , and shot aloft as though refreshed by food .
Parsing [sent. 8227 len. 7]: The noise increased as he looked .
Parsing [sent. 8228 len. 13]: There were people there -- men and women -- light , bustle .
Parsing [sent. 8229 len. 8]: It was like new life to him .
Parsing [sent. 8230 len. 35]: He darted onward -- straight , headlong -- dashing through brier and brake , and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog , who careered with loud and sounding bark before him .
Parsing [sent. 8231 len. 6]: He came upon the spot .
Parsing [sent. 8232 len. 54]: There were half-dressed figures tearing to and fro , some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables , others driving the cattle from the yard and out-houses , and others coming laden from the burning pile , amidst a shower of falling sparks , and the tumbling down of red-hot beams .
Parsing [sent. 8233 len. 43]: The apertures , where doors and windows stood an hour ago , disclosed a mass of raging fire ; walls rocked and crumbled into the burning well ; the molten lead and iron poured down , white hot , upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 8234 len. 16]: Women and children shrieked , and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers .
Parsing [sent. 8235 len. 28]: The clanking of the engine-pumps , and the spirting and hissing of the water as it fell upon the blazing wood , added to the tremendous roar .
Parsing [sent. 8236 len. 25]: He shouted , too , till he was hoarse ; and flying from memory and himself , plunged into the thickest of the throng .
Parsing [sent. 8237 len. 36]: Hither and thither he dived that night : now working at the pumps , and now hurrying through the smoke and flame , but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and men were thickest .
Parsing [sent. 8238 len. 73]: Up and down the ladders , upon the roofs of buildings , over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight , under the lee of falling bricks and stones , in every part of that great fire was he ; but he bore a charmed life , and had neither scratch nor bruise , nor weariness nor thought , till morning dawned again , and only smoke and blackened ruins remained .
Parsing [sent. 8239 len. 19]: This mad excitement over , there returned , with ten-fold force , the dreadful consciousness of his crime .
Parsing [sent. 8240 len. 25]: He looked suspiciously about him , for the men were conversing in groups , and he feared to be the subject of their talk .
Parsing [sent. 8241 len. 19]: The dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger , and they drew off , stealthily , together .
Parsing [sent. 8242 len. 22]: He passed near an engine where some men were seated , and they called to him to share in their refreshment .
Parsing [sent. 8243 len. 30]: He took some bread and meat ; and as he drank a draught of beer , heard the firemen , who were from London , talking about the murder .
Parsing [sent. 8244 len. 43]: ` He has gone to Birmingham , they say , ' said one : ` but they 'll have him yet , for the scouts are out , and by to-morrow night there 'll be a cry all through the country . '
Parsing [sent. 8245 len. 32]: He hurried off , and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground ; then lay down in a lane , and had a long , but broken and uneasy sleep .
Parsing [sent. 8246 len. 19]: He wandered on again , irresolute and undecided , and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night .
Parsing [sent. 8247 len. 13]: Suddenly , he took the desperate resolution to going back to London .
Parsing [sent. 8248 len. 18]: ` There 's somebody to speak to there , at all event , ' he thought . '
Parsing [sent. 8249 len. 6]: A good hiding-place , too .
Parsing [sent. 8250 len. 14]: They 'll never expect to nab me there , after this country scent .
Parsing [sent. 8251 len. 24]: Why ca n't I lie by for a week or so , and , forcing blunt from Fagin , get abroad to France ?
Parsing [sent. 8252 len. 8]: Damme , I 'll risk it . '
Parsing [sent. 8253 len. 59]: He acted upon this impluse without delay , and choosing the least frequented roads began his journey back , resolved to lie concealed within a short distance of the metropolis , and , entering it at dusk by a circuitous route , to proceed straight to that part of it which he had fixed on for his destination .
Parsing [sent. 8254 len. 5]: The dog , though .
Parsing [sent. 8255 len. 26]: If any description of him were out , it would not be forgotten that the dog was missing , and had probably gone with him .
Parsing [sent. 8256 len. 13]: This might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets .
Parsing [sent. 8257 len. 31]: He resolved to drown him , and walked on , looking about for a pond : picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his handerkerchief as he went .
Parsing [sent. 8258 len. 57]: The animal looked up into his master 's face while these preparations were making ; whether his instinct apprehended something of their purpose , or the robber 's sidelong look at him was sterner than ordinary , he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual , and cowered as he came more slowly along .
Parsing [sent. 8259 len. 22]: When his master halted at the brink of a pool , and looked round to call him , he stopped outright .
Parsing [sent. 8260 len. 7]: ` Do you hear me call ?
Parsing [sent. 8261 len. 4]: Come here ! '
Parsing [sent. 8262 len. 3]: cried Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 8263 len. 32]: The animal came up from the very force of habit ; but as Sikes stooped to attach the handkerchief to his throat , he uttered a low growl and started back .
Parsing [sent. 8264 len. 5]: ` Come back ! '
Parsing [sent. 8265 len. 4]: said the robber .
Parsing [sent. 8266 len. 10]: The dog wagged his tail , but moved not .
Parsing [sent. 8267 len. 10]: Sikes made a running noose and called him again .
Parsing [sent. 8268 len. 18]: The dog advanced , retreated , paused an instant , and scoured away at his hardest speed .
Parsing [sent. 8269 len. 20]: The man whistled again and again , and sat down and waited in the expectation that he would return .
Parsing [sent. 8270 len. 13]: But no dog appeared , and at length he resumed his journey .
Parsing [sent. 8271 len. 10]: CHAPTER XLIX MONKS AND MR. BROWNLOW AT LENGTH MEET .
Parsing [sent. 8272 len. 33]: THEIR CONVERSATION , AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT INTERRUPTS IT The twilight was beginning to close in , when Mr. Brownlow alighted from a hackney-coach at his own door , and knocked softly .
Parsing [sent. 8273 len. 45]: The door being opened , a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one side of the steps , while another man , who had been seated on the box , dismounted too , and stood upon the other side .
Parsing [sent. 8274 len. 26]: At a sign from Mr. Brownlow , they helped out a third man , and taking him between them , hurried him into the house .
Parsing [sent. 8275 len. 5]: This man was Monks .
Parsing [sent. 8276 len. 26]: They walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking , and Mr. Brownlow , preceding them , led the way into a back-room .
Parsing [sent. 8277 len. 18]: At the door of this apartment , Monks , who had ascended with evident reluctance , stopped .
Parsing [sent. 8278 len. 13]: The two men looked at the old gentleman as if for instructions .
Parsing [sent. 8279 len. 11]: ` He knows the alternative , ' said Mr. Browlow .
Parsing [sent. 8280 len. 39]: ` If he hesitates or moves a finger but as you bid him , drag him into the street , call for the aid of the police , and impeach him as a felon in my name . '
Parsing [sent. 8281 len. 10]: ` How dare you say this of me ? '
Parsing [sent. 8282 len. 3]: asked Monks .
Parsing [sent. 8283 len. 13]: ` How dare you urge me to it , young man ? '
Parsing [sent. 8284 len. 11]: replied Mr. Brownlow , confronting him with a steady look .
Parsing [sent. 8285 len. 10]: ` Are you mad enough to leave this house ?
Parsing [sent. 8286 len. 3]: Unhand him .
Parsing [sent. 8287 len. 4]: There , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8288 len. 11]: You are free to go , and we to follow .
Parsing [sent. 8289 len. 29]: But I warn you , by all I hold most solemn and most sacred , that instant will have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery .
Parsing [sent. 8290 len. 6]: I am resolute and immoveable .
Parsing [sent. 8291 len. 18]: If you are determined to be the same , your blood be upon your own head ! '
Parsing [sent. 8292 len. 19]: ` By what authority am I kidnapped in the street , and brought here by these dogs ? '
Parsing [sent. 8293 len. 17]: asked Monks , looking from one to the other of the men who stood beside him .
Parsing [sent. 8294 len. 9]: ` By mine , ' replied Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 8295 len. 8]: ` Those persons are indemnified by me .
Parsing [sent. 8296 len. 44]: If you complain of being deprived of your liberty -- you had power and opportunity to retrieve it as you came along , but you deemed it advisable to remain quiet -- I say again , throw yourself for protection on the law .
Parsing [sent. 8297 len. 54]: I will appeal to the law too ; but when you have gone too far to recede , do not sue to me for leniency , when the power will have passed into other hands ; and do not say I plunged you down the gulf into which you rushed , yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 8298 len. 9]: Monks was plainly disconcerted , and alarmed besides .
Parsing [sent. 8299 len. 3]: He hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 8300 len. 17]: ` You will decide quickly , ' said Mr. Brownlow , with perfect firmness and composure .
Parsing [sent. 8301 len. 49]: ` If you wish me to prefer my charges publicly , and consign you to a punishment the extent of which , although I can , with a shudder , foresee , I can not control , once more , I say , for you know the way .
Parsing [sent. 8302 len. 31]: If not , and you appeal to my forbearance , and the mercy of those you have deeply injured , seat yourself , without a word , in that chair .
Parsing [sent. 8303 len. 10]: It has waited for you two whole days . '
Parsing [sent. 8304 len. 10]: Monks muttered some unintelligible words , but wavered still .
Parsing [sent. 8305 len. 12]: ` You will be prompt , ' said Mr. Brownlow . '
Parsing [sent. 8306 len. 14]: A word from me , and the alternative has gone for ever . '
Parsing [sent. 8307 len. 6]: Still the man hesitated . '
Parsing [sent. 8308 len. 32]: I have not the inclination to parley , ' said Mr. Brownlow , ` and , as I advocate the dearest interests of others , I have not the right . '
Parsing [sent. 8309 len. 22]: ` Is there -- ' demanded Monks with a faltering tongue , -- ` is there -- no middle course ? '
Parsing [sent. 8310 len. 4]: ` None . '
Parsing [sent. 8311 len. 38]: Monks looked at the old gentleman , with an anxious eye ; but , reading in his countenance nothing but severity and determination , walked into the room , and , shrugging his shoulders , sat down .
Parsing [sent. 8312 len. 24]: ` Lock the door on the outside , ' said Mr. Brownlow to the attendants , ` and come when I ring . '
Parsing [sent. 8313 len. 12]: The men obeyed , and the two were left alone together .
Parsing [sent. 8314 len. 28]: ` This is pretty treatment , sir , ' said Monks , throwing down his hat and cloak , ` from my father 's oldest friend . '
Parsing [sent. 8315 len. 190]: ` It is because I was your father 's oldest friend , young man , ' returned Mr. Brownlow ; ` it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy years were bound up with him , and that fair creature of his blood and kindred who rejoined her God in youth , and left me here a solitary , lonely man : it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters ' death-bed when he was yet a boy , on the morning that would -- but Heaven willed otherwise -- have made her my young wife ; it is because my seared heart clung to him , from that time forth , through all his trials and errors , till he died ; it is because old recollections and associations filled my heart , and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of him ; it is because of all these things that I am moved to treat you gently now -- yes , Edward Leeford , even now -- and blush for your unworthiness who bear the name . '
Parsing [sent. 8316 len. 11]: ` What has the name to do with it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8317 len. 23]: asked the other , after contemplating , half in silence , and half in dogged wonder , the agitation of his companion .
Parsing [sent. 8318 len. 9]: ` What is the name to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 8319 len. 13]: ` Nothing , ' replied Mr. Brownlow , ` nothing to you .
Parsing [sent. 8320 len. 39]: But it was HERS , and even at this distance of time brings back to me , an old man , the glow and thrill which I once felt , only to hear it repeated by a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 8321 len. 14]: I am very glad you have changed it -- very -- very . '
Parsing [sent. 8322 len. 48]: ` This is all mighty fine , ' said Monks -LRB- to retain his assumed designation -RRB- after a long silence , during which he had jerked himself in sullen defiance to and fro , and Mr. Brownlow had sat , shading his face with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 8323 len. 10]: ` But what do you want with me ? '
Parsing [sent. 8324 len. 56]: ` You have a brother , ' said Mr. Brownlow , rousing himself : ' a brother , the whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the street , was , in itself , almost enough to make you accompany me hither , in wonder and alarm . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8325 len. 9]: I have no brother , ' replied Monks .
Parsing [sent. 8326 len. 9]: ` You know I was an only child .
Parsing [sent. 8327 len. 9]: Why do you talk to me of brothers ?
Parsing [sent. 8328 len. 28]: You know that , as well as I. ' ` Attend to what I do know , and you may not , ' said Mr. Brownlow . '
Parsing [sent. 8329 len. 8]: I shall interest you by and by .
Parsing [sent. 8330 len. 43]: I know that of the wretched marriage , into which family pride , and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition , forced your unhappy father when a mere boy , you were the sole and most unnatural issue . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8331 len. 16]: I do n't care for hard names , ' interrupted Monks with a jeering laugh .
Parsing [sent. 8332 len. 14]: ` You know the fact , and that 's enough for me . '
Parsing [sent. 8333 len. 28]: ` But I also know , ' pursued the old gentleman , ` the misery , the slow torture , the protracted anguish of that ill-assorted union .
Parsing [sent. 8334 len. 26]: I know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both .
Parsing [sent. 8335 len. 74]: I know how cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts ; how indifference gave place to dislike , dislike to hate , and hate to loathing , until at last they wrenched the clanking bond asunder , and retiring a wide space apart , carried each a galling fragment , of which nothing but death could break the rivets , to hide it in new society beneath the gayest looks they could assume .
Parsing [sent. 8336 len. 9]: Your mother succeeded ; she forgot it soon .
Parsing [sent. 8337 len. 14]: But it rusted and cankered at your father 's heart for years . '
Parsing [sent. 8338 len. 18]: ` Well , they were separated , ' said Monks , ` and what of that ? '
Parsing [sent. 8339 len. 56]: ` When they had been separated for some time , ' returned Mr. Brownlow , ` and your mother , wholly given up to continental frivolities , had utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior , who , with prospects blighted , lingered on at home , he fell among new friends .
Parsing [sent. 8340 len. 11]: This circumstance , at least , you know already . '
Parsing [sent. 8341 len. 30]: ` Not I , ' said Monks , turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon the ground , as a man who is determined to deny everything .
Parsing [sent. 8342 len. 38]: ` Not I. ' ` Your manner , no less than your actions , assures me that you have never forgotten it , or ceased to think of it with bitterness , ' returned Mr. Brownlow . '
Parsing [sent. 8343 len. 41]: I speak of fifteen years ago , when you were not more than eleven years old , and your father but one-and-thirty -- for he was , I repeat , a boy , when HIS father ordered him to marry .
Parsing [sent. 8344 len. 32]: Must I go back to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent , or will you spare it , and disclose to me the truth ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8345 len. 10]: I have nothing to disclose , ' rejoined Monks .
Parsing [sent. 8346 len. 10]: ` You must talk on if you will . '
Parsing [sent. 8347 len. 54]: ` These new friends , then , ' said Mr. Brownlow , ` were a naval officer retired from active service , whose wife had died some half-a-year before , and left him with two children -- there had been more , but , of all their family , happily but two survived .
Parsing [sent. 8348 len. 26]: They were both daughters ; one a beautiful creature of nineteen , and the other a mere child of two or three years old . '
Parsing [sent. 8349 len. 8]: ` What 's this to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 8350 len. 3]: asked Monks .
Parsing [sent. 8351 len. 42]: ` They resided , ' said Mr. Brownlow , without seeming to hear the interruption , ` in a part of the country to which your father in his wandering had repaired , and where he had taken up his abode .
Parsing [sent. 8352 len. 12]: Acquaintance , intimacy , friendship , fast followed on each other .
Parsing [sent. 8353 len. 9]: Your father was gifted as few men are .
Parsing [sent. 8354 len. 9]: He had his sister 's soul and person .
Parsing [sent. 8355 len. 16]: As the old officer knew him more and more , he grew to love him .
Parsing [sent. 8356 len. 8]: I would that it had ended there .
Parsing [sent. 8357 len. 6]: His daughter did the same .
Parsing [sent. 8358 len. 61]: The old gentleman paused ; Monks was biting his lips , with his eyes fixed upon the floor ; seeing this , he immediately resumed : ` The end of a year found him contracted , solemnly contracted , to that daughter ; the object of the first , true , ardent , only passion of a guileless girl . '
Parsing [sent. 8359 len. 18]: ` Your tale is of the longest , ' observed Monks , moving restlessly in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 8360 len. 45]: ` It is a true tale of grief and trial , and sorrow , young man , ' returned Mr. Brownlow , ` and such tales usually are ; if it were one of unmixed joy and happiness , it would be very brief .
Parsing [sent. 8361 len. 54]: At length one of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been sacrificed , as others are often -- it is no uncommon case -- died , and to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning , left him his panacea for all griefs -- Money .
Parsing [sent. 8362 len. 32]: It was necessary that he should immediately repair to Rome , whither this man had sped for health , and where he had died , leaving his affairs in great confusion .
Parsing [sent. 8363 len. 56]: He went ; was seized with mortal illness there ; was followed , the moment the intelligence reached Paris , by your mother who carried you with her ; he died the day after her arrival , leaving no will -- NO WILL -- so that the whole property fell to her and you . '
Parsing [sent. 8364 len. 30]: At this part of the recital Monks held his breath , and listened with a face of intense eagerness , though his eyes were not directed towards the speaker .
Parsing [sent. 8365 len. 29]: As Mr. Brownlow paused , he changed his position with the air of one who has experienced a sudden relief , and wiped his hot face and hands .
Parsing [sent. 8366 len. 41]: ` Before he went abroad , and as he passed through London on his way , ' said Mr. Brownlow , slowly , and fixing his eyes upon the other 's face , ` he came to me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8367 len. 24]: I never heard of that , ' interrupted MOnks in a tone intended to appear incredulous , but savouring more of disagreeable surprise .
Parsing [sent. 8368 len. 51]: ` He came to me , and left with me , among some other things , a picture -- a portrait painted by himself -- a likeness of this poor girl -- which he did not wish to leave behind , and could not carry forward on his hasty journey .
Parsing [sent. 8369 len. 83]: He was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow ; talked in a wild , distracted way , of ruin and dishonour worked by himself ; confided to me his intention to convert his whole property , at any loss , into money , and , having settled on his wife and you a portion of his recent acquisition , to fly the country -- I guessed too well he would not fly alone -- and never see it more .
Parsing [sent. 8370 len. 61]: Even from me , his old and early friend , whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that covered one most dear to both -- even from me he withheld any more particular confession , promising to write and tell me all , and after that to see me once again , for the last time on earth .
Parsing [sent. 8371 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 8372 len. 6]: THAT was the last time .
Parsing [sent. 8373 len. 14]: I had no letter , and I never saw him more . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8374 len. 77]: I went , ' said Mr. Brownlow , after a short pause , ' I went , when all was over , to the scene of his -- I will use the term the world would freely use , for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him -- of his guilty love , resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child should find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her .
Parsing [sent. 8375 len. 31]: The family had left that part a week before ; they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding , discharged them , and left the place by night .
Parsing [sent. 8376 len. 10]: Why , or whithter , none can tell . '
Parsing [sent. 8377 len. 17]: Monks drew his breath yet more freely , and looked round with a smile of triumph .
Parsing [sent. 8378 len. 60]: ` When your brother , ' said Mr. Brownlow , drawing nearer to the other 's chair , ` When your brother : a feeble , ragged , neglected child : was cast in my way by a stronger hand than chance , and rescued by me from a life of vice and infamy -- ' ` What ? '
Parsing [sent. 8379 len. 3]: cried Monks .
Parsing [sent. 8380 len. 10]: ` By me , ' said Mr. Brownlow . '
Parsing [sent. 8381 len. 10]: I told you I should interest you before long .
Parsing [sent. 8382 len. 30]: I say by me -- I see that your cunning associate suppressed my name , although for ought he knew , it would be quite strange to your ears .
Parsing [sent. 8383 len. 34]: When he was rescued by me , then , and lay recovering from sickness in my house , his strong resemblance to this picture I have spoken of , struck me with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 8384 len. 40]: Even when I first saw him in all his dirt and misery , there was a lingering expression in his face that came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream .
Parsing [sent. 8385 len. 21]: I need not tell you he was snared away before I knew his history -- ' ` Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 8386 len. 4]: asked Monks hastily .
Parsing [sent. 8387 len. 8]: ` Because you know it well . '
Parsing [sent. 8388 len. 4]: ` I ! '
Parsing [sent. 8389 len. 13]: ` Denial to me is vain , ' replied Mr. Brownlow . '
Parsing [sent. 8390 len. 12]: I shall show you that I know more than that . '
Parsing [sent. 8391 len. 17]: ` You -- you -- ca n't prove anything against me , ' stammered Monks . '
Parsing [sent. 8392 len. 8]: I defy you to do it ! '
Parsing [sent. 8393 len. 16]: ` We shall see , ' returned the old gentleman with a searching glance . '
Parsing [sent. 8394 len. 14]: I lost the boy , and no efforts of mine could recover him .
Parsing [sent. 8395 len. 66]: Your mother being dead , I knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody could , and as when I had last heard of you you were on your own estate in the West Indies -- whither , as you well know , you retired upon your mother 's death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here -- I made the voyage .
Parsing [sent. 8396 len. 23]: You had left it , months before , and were supposed to be in London , but no one could tell where .
Parsing [sent. 8397 len. 3]: I returned .
Parsing [sent. 8398 len. 9]: Your agents had no clue to your residence .
Parsing [sent. 8399 len. 52]: You came and went , they said , as strangely as you had ever done : sometimes for days together and sometimes not for months : keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce ungovernable boy .
Parsing [sent. 8400 len. 7]: I wearied them with new applications .
Parsing [sent. 8401 len. 31]: I paced the streets by night and day , but until two hours ago , all my efforts were fruitless , and I never saw you for an instant . '
Parsing [sent. 8402 len. 19]: ` And now you do see me , ' said Monks , rising boldly , ` what then ?
Parsing [sent. 8403 len. 31]: Fraud and robbery are high-sounding words -- justified , you think , by a fancied resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead man 's Brother !
Parsing [sent. 8404 len. 24]: You do n't even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair ; you do n't even know that . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8405 len. 24]: I DID NOT , ' replied Mr. Brownlow , rising too ; ` but within the last fortnight I have learnt it all .
Parsing [sent. 8406 len. 12]: You have a brother ; you know it , and him .
Parsing [sent. 8407 len. 23]: There was a will , which your mother destroyed , leaving the secret and the gain to you at her own death .
Parsing [sent. 8408 len. 41]: It contained a reference to some child likely to be the result of this sad connection , which child was born , and accidentally encountered by you , when your suspicions were first awakened by his resemblance to your father .
Parsing [sent. 8409 len. 9]: You repaired to the place of his birth .
Parsing [sent. 8410 len. 14]: There existed proofs -- proofs long suppressed -- of his birth and parentage .
Parsing [sent. 8411 len. 54]: Those proofs were destroyed by you , and now , in your own words to your accomplice the Jew , `` THE ONLY PROOFS OF THE BOY 'S IDENTITY LIE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER , AND THE OLD HAG THAT RECEIVED THEM FORM THE MOTHER IS ROTTING IN HER COFFIN . ''
Parsing [sent. 8412 len. 112]: Unworthy son , coward , liar , -- you , who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at night , -- you , whose plots and wiles have brought a violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as you , -- you , who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father 's heart , and in whom all evil passions , vice , and profligacy , festered , till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to your mind -- you , Edward Leeford , do you still brave me ! '
Parsing [sent. 8413 len. 8]: ` No , no , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 8414 len. 10]: returned the coward , overwhelmed by these accumulated charges .
Parsing [sent. 8415 len. 5]: ` Every word ! '
Parsing [sent. 8416 len. 22]: cried the gentleman , ` every word that has passed between you and this detested villain , is known to me .
Parsing [sent. 8417 len. 39]: Shadows on the wall have caught your whispers , and brought them to my ear ; the sight of the persecuted child has turned vice itself , and given it the courage and almost the attributes of virtue .
Parsing [sent. 8418 len. 17]: Murder has been done , to which you were morally if not really a party . '
Parsing [sent. 8419 len. 9]: ` No , no , ' interposed Monks .
Parsing [sent. 8420 len. 24]: ` I -- I knew nothing of that ; I was going to inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me .
Parsing [sent. 8421 len. 7]: I did n't know the cause .
Parsing [sent. 8422 len. 9]: I thought it was a common quarrel . '
Parsing [sent. 8423 len. 15]: ` It was the partial disclosure of your secrets , ' replied Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 8424 len. 8]: ` Will you disclose the whole ? '
Parsing [sent. 8425 len. 7]: ` Yes , I will . '
Parsing [sent. 8426 len. 19]: ` Set your hand to a statement of truth and facts , and repeat it before witnesses ? '
Parsing [sent. 8427 len. 7]: ` That I promise too . '
Parsing [sent. 8428 len. 36]: ` Remain quietly here , until such a document is drawn up , and proceed with me to such a place as I may deem most advisable , for the purpose of attesting it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8429 len. 17]: ` If you insist upon that , I 'll do that also , ' replied Monks .
Parsing [sent. 8430 len. 13]: ` You must do more than that , ' said Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 8431 len. 26]: ` Make restitution to an innocent and unoffending child , for such he is , although the offspring of a guilty and most miserable love .
Parsing [sent. 8432 len. 10]: You have not forgotten the provisions of the will .
Parsing [sent. 8433 len. 19]: Carry them into execution so far as your brother is concerned , and then go where you please .
Parsing [sent. 8434 len. 10]: In this world you need meet no more . '
Parsing [sent. 8435 len. 59]: While Monks was pacing up and down , meditating with dark and evil looks on this proposal and the possibilities of evading it : torn by his fears on the one hand and his hatred on the other : the door was hurriedly unlocked , and a gentleman -LRB- Mr. Losberne -RRB- entered the room in violent agitation .
Parsing [sent. 8436 len. 11]: ` The man will be taken , ' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 8437 len. 8]: ` He will be taken to-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 8438 len. 5]: ` The murderer ? '
Parsing [sent. 8439 len. 4]: asked Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 8440 len. 10]: ` Yes , yes , ' replied the other .
Parsing [sent. 8441 len. 35]: ` His dog has been seen lurking about some old haunt , and there seems little doubt hat his master either is , or will be , there , under cover of the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 8442 len. 8]: Spies are hovering about in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 8443 len. 22]: I have spoken to the men who are charged with his capture , and they tell me he can not escape .
Parsing [sent. 8444 len. 14]: A reward of a hundred pounds is proclaimed by Government to-night . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8445 len. 29]: I will give fifty more , ' said Mr. Brownlow , ` and proclaim it with my own lips upon the spot , if I can reach it .
Parsing [sent. 8446 len. 6]: Where is Mr. Maylie ? '
Parsing [sent. 8447 len. 3]: ` Harry ?
Parsing [sent. 8448 len. 55]: As soon as he had seen your friend here , safe in a coach with you , he hurried off to where he heard this , ' replied the doctor , ` and mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them . '
Parsing [sent. 8449 len. 14]: ` Fagin , ' said Mr. Brownlow ; ` what of him ? '
Parsing [sent. 8450 len. 24]: ` When I last heard , he had not been taken , but he will be , or is , by this time .
Parsing [sent. 8451 len. 7]: They 're sure of him . '
Parsing [sent. 8452 len. 9]: ` Have you made up your mind ? '
Parsing [sent. 8453 len. 12]: asked Mr. Brownlow , in a low voice , of Monks .
Parsing [sent. 8454 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 8455 len. 13]: ` You -- you -- will be secret with me ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8456 len. 3]: I will .
Parsing [sent. 8457 len. 6]: Remain here till I return .
Parsing [sent. 8458 len. 8]: It is your only hope of safety .
Parsing [sent. 8459 len. 12]: They left the room , and the door was again locked .
Parsing [sent. 8460 len. 7]: ` What have you done ? '
Parsing [sent. 8461 len. 7]: asked the doctor in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 8462 len. 13]: ` All that I could hope to do , and even more .
Parsing [sent. 8463 len. 47]: Coupling the poor girl 's intelligence with my previous knowledge , and the result of our good friend 's inquiries on the spot , I left him no loophole of escape , and laid bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day .
Parsing [sent. 8464 len. 15]: Write and appoint the evening after to-morrow , at seven , for the meeting .
Parsing [sent. 8465 len. 39]: We shall be down there , a few hours before , but shall require rest : especially the young lady , who MAY have greater need of firmness than either you or I can quite foresee just now .
Parsing [sent. 8466 len. 11]: But my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered creature .
Parsing [sent. 8467 len. 7]: Which way have they taken ? '
Parsing [sent. 8468 len. 19]: ` Drive straight to the office and you will be in time , ' replied Mr. Losberne . '
Parsing [sent. 8469 len. 6]: I will remain here . '
Parsing [sent. 8470 len. 15]: The two gentlemen hastily separated ; each in a fever of excitement wholly uncontrollable .
Parsing [sent. 8471 len. 85]: CHAPTER L THE PURSUIT AND ESCAPE Near to that part of the Thames on which the church at Rotherhithe abuts , where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of close-built low-roofed houses , there exists the filthiest , the strangest , the most extraordinary of the many localities that are hidden in London , wholly unknown , even by name , to the great mass of its inhabitants .
Parsing [sent. 8472 len. 44]: To reach this place , the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of close , narrow , and muddy streets , thronged by the rougest and poorest of waterside people , and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to occasion .
Parsing [sent. 8473 len. 35]: The cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the shops ; the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at the salesman 's door , and stream from the house-parapet and windows .
Parsing [sent. 8474 len. 80]: Jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class , ballast-heavers , coal-whippers , brazen women , ragged children , and the raff and refuse of the river , he makes his way with difficulty along , assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which branch off on the right and left , and deafened by the clash of ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks of warehouses that rise from every corner .
Parsing [sent. 8475 len. 69]: Arriving , at length , in streets remoter and less-frequented than those through which he has passed , he walks beneath tottering house-fronts projecting over the pavement , dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes , chimneys half crushed half hesitating to fall , windows guarded by rusty iron bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away , every imaginable sign of desolation and neglect .
Parsing [sent. 8476 len. 57]: In such a neighborhood , beyond Dockhead in the Borough of Southwark , stands Jacob 's Island , surrounded by a muddy ditch , six or eight feet deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in , once called Mill Pond , but known in the days of this story as Folly Ditch .
Parsing [sent. 8477 len. 34]: It is a creek or inlet from the Thames , and can always be filled at high water by opening the sluices at the Lead Mills from which it took its old name .
Parsing [sent. 8478 len. 83]: At such times , a stranger , looking from one of the wooden bridges thrown across it at Mill Lane , will see the inhabitants of the houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows , buckets , pails , domestic utensils of all kinds , in which to haul the water up ; and when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses themselves , his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before him .
Parsing [sent. 8479 len. 126]: Crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses , with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath ; windows , broken and patched , with poles thrust out , on which to dry the linen that is never there ; rooms so small , so filthy , so confined , that the air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter ; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud , and threatening to fall into it -- as some have done ; dirt-besmeared walls and decaying foundations ; every repulsive lineament of poverty , every loathsome indication of filth , rot , and garbage ; all these ornament the banks of Folly Ditch .
Parsing [sent. 8480 len. 44]: In Jacob 's Island , the warehouses are roofless and empty ; the walls are crumbling down ; the windows are windows no more ; the doors are falling into the streets ; the chimneys are blackened , but they yield no smoke .
Parsing [sent. 8481 len. 30]: Thirty or forty years ago , before losses and chancery suits came upon it , it was a thriving place ; but now it is a desolate island indeed .
Parsing [sent. 8482 len. 31]: The houses have no owners ; they are broken open , and entered upon by those who have the courage ; and there they live , and there they die .
Parsing [sent. 8483 len. 28]: They must have powerful motives for a secret residence , or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed , who seek a refuge in Jacob 's Island .
Parsing [sent. 8484 len. 76]: In an upper room of one of these houses -- a detached house of fair size , ruinous in other respects , but strongly defended at door and window : of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already described -- there were assembled three men , who , regarding each other every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation , sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence .
Parsing [sent. 8485 len. 50]: One of these was Toby Crackit , another Mr. Chitling , and the third a robber of fifty years , whose nose had been almost beaten in , in some old scuffle , and whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same occasion .
Parsing [sent. 8486 len. 14]: This man was a returned transport , and his name was Kags . '
Parsing [sent. 8487 len. 40]: I wish , ' said Toby turning to Mr. Chitling , ` that you had picked out some other crig when the two old ones got too warm , and had not come here , my fine feller . '
Parsing [sent. 8488 len. 9]: ` Why did n't you , blunder-head ! '
Parsing [sent. 8489 len. 3]: said Kags .
Parsing [sent. 8490 len. 29]: ` Well , I thought you 'd have been a little more glad to see me than this , ' replied Mr. Chitling , with a melancholy air .
Parsing [sent. 8491 len. 88]: ` Why , look ` e , young gentleman , ' said Toby , ` when a man keeps himself so very ex-clusive as I have done , and by that means has a snug house over his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it , it 's rather a startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman -LRB- however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with at conweniency -RRB- circumstanced as you are . '
Parsing [sent. 8492 len. 48]: ` Especially , when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping with him , that 's arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts , and is too modest to want to be presented to the Judges on his return , ' added Mr. Kags .
Parsing [sent. 8493 len. 40]: There was a short silence , after which Toby Crackit , seeming to abandon as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil-may-care swagger , turned to Chitling and said , ` When was Fagin took then ? '
Parsing [sent. 8494 len. 10]: ` Just at dinner-time -- two o'clock this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 8495 len. 45]: Charley and I made our lucky up the wash-us chimney , and Bolter got into the empty water-butt , head downwards ; but his legs were so precious long that they stuck out at the top , and so they took him too . '
Parsing [sent. 8496 len. 5]: ` And Bet ? '
Parsing [sent. 8497 len. 4]: ` Poor Bet !
Parsing [sent. 8498 len. 63]: She went to see the Body , to speak to who it was , ' replied Chitling , his countenance falling more and more , ` and went off mad , screaming and raving , and beating her head against the boards ; so they put a strait-weskut on her and took her to the hospital -- and there she is . '
Parsing [sent. 8499 len. 9]: ` Wot 's come of young Bates ? '
Parsing [sent. 8500 len. 3]: demanded Kags .
Parsing [sent. 8501 len. 24]: ` He hung about , not to come over here afore dark , but he 'll be here soon , ' replied Chitling .
Parsing [sent. 8502 len. 46]: ` There 's nowhere else to go to now , for the people at the Cripples are all in custody , and the bar of the ken -- I went up there and see it with my own eyes -- is filled with traps . '
Parsing [sent. 8503 len. 14]: ` This is a smash , ' observed Toby , biting his lips .
Parsing [sent. 8504 len. 12]: ` There 's more than one will go with this . '
Parsing [sent. 8505 len. 71]: ` The sessions are on , ' said Kags : ` if they get the inquest over , and Bolter turns King 's evidence : as of course he will , from what he 's said already : they can prove Fagin an accessory before the fact , and get the trial on on Friday , and he 'll swing in six days from this , by G -- ! '
Parsing [sent. 8506 len. 28]: ` You should have heard the people groan , ' said Chitling ; ` the officers fought like devils , or they 'd have torn him away .
Parsing [sent. 8507 len. 19]: He was down once , but they made a ring round him , and fought their way along .
Parsing [sent. 8508 len. 27]: You should have seen how he looked about him , all muddy and bleeding , and clung to them as if they were his dearest friends .
Parsing [sent. 8509 len. 89]: I can see 'em now , not able to stand upright with the pressing of the mob , and draggin him along amongst 'em ; I can see the people jumping up , one behind another , and snarling with their teeth and making at him ; I can see the blood upon his hair and beard , and hear the cries with which the women worked themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner , and swore they 'd tear his heart out ! '
Parsing [sent. 8510 len. 31]: The horror-stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his ears , and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro , like one distracted .
Parsing [sent. 8511 len. 40]: While he was thus engaged , and the two men sat by in silence with their eyes fixed upon the floor , a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs , and Sikes 's dog bounded into the room .
Parsing [sent. 8512 len. 13]: They ran to the window , downstairs , and into the street .
Parsing [sent. 8513 len. 26]: The dog had jumped in at an open window ; he made no attempt to follow them , nor was his master to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 8514 len. 9]: ` What 's the meaning of this ? '
Parsing [sent. 8515 len. 7]: said Toby when they had returned .
Parsing [sent. 8516 len. 8]: ` He ca n't be coming here .
Parsing [sent. 8517 len. 8]: I -- I -- hope not . '
Parsing [sent. 8518 len. 33]: ` If he was coming here , he 'd have come with the dog , ' said Kags , stooping down to examine the animal , who lay panting on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 8519 len. 3]: ` Here !
Parsing [sent. 8520 len. 14]: Give us some water for him ; he has run himself faint . '
Parsing [sent. 8521 len. 23]: ` He 's drunk it all up , every drop , ' said Chitling after watching the dog some time in silence .
Parsing [sent. 8522 len. 19]: ` Covered with mud -- lame -- half blind -- he must have come a long way . '
Parsing [sent. 8523 len. 9]: ` Where can he have come from ! '
Parsing [sent. 8524 len. 3]: exclaimed Toby .
Parsing [sent. 8525 len. 31]: ` He 's been to the other kens of course , and finding them filled with strangers come on here , where he 's been many a time and often .
Parsing [sent. 8526 len. 20]: But where can he have come from first , and how comes he here alone without the other ! '
Parsing [sent. 8527 len. 27]: ` He ' -- -LRB- none of them called the murderer by his old name -RRB- -- ` He ca n't have made away with himself .
Parsing [sent. 8528 len. 6]: What do you think ? '
Parsing [sent. 8529 len. 3]: said Chitling .
Parsing [sent. 8530 len. 5]: Toby shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 8531 len. 25]: ` If he had , ' said Kags , ` the dog ` ud want to lead us away to where he did it .
Parsing [sent. 8532 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 8533 len. 16]: I think he 's got out of the country , and left the dog behind .
Parsing [sent. 8534 len. 18]: He must have given him the slip somehow , or he would n't be so easy . '
Parsing [sent. 8535 len. 35]: This solution , appearing the most probable one , was adopted as the right ; the dog , creeping under a chair , coiled himself up to sleep , without more notice from anybody .
Parsing [sent. 8536 len. 20]: It being now dark , the shutter was closed , and a candle lighted and placed upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 8537 len. 28]: The terrible events of the last two days had made a deep impression on all three , increased by the danger and uncertainty of their own position .
Parsing [sent. 8538 len. 12]: They drew their chairs closer together , starting at every sound .
Parsing [sent. 8539 len. 29]: They spoke little , and that in whispers , and were as silent and awe-stricken as if the remains of the murdered woman lay in the next room .
Parsing [sent. 8540 len. 20]: They had sat thus , some time , when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the door below .
Parsing [sent. 8541 len. 20]: ` Young Bates , ' said Kags , looking angrily round , to check the fear he felt himself .
Parsing [sent. 8542 len. 5]: The knocking came again .
Parsing [sent. 8543 len. 7]: No , it was n't he .
Parsing [sent. 8544 len. 6]: He never knocked like that .
Parsing [sent. 8545 len. 16]: Crackit went to the window , and shaking all over , drew in his head .
Parsing [sent. 8546 len. 17]: There was no need to tell them who it was ; his pale face was enough .
Parsing [sent. 8547 len. 18]: The dog too was on the alert in an instant , and ran whining to the door .
Parsing [sent. 8548 len. 16]: ` We must let him in , ' he said , taking up the candle .
Parsing [sent. 8549 len. 10]: ` Is n't there any help for it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8550 len. 9]: asked the other man in a hoarse voice .
Parsing [sent. 8551 len. 3]: ` None .
Parsing [sent. 8552 len. 6]: He MUST come in . '
Parsing [sent. 8553 len. 41]: ` Do n't leave us in the dark , ' said Kags , taking down a candle from the chimney-piece , and lighting it , with such a trembling hand that the knocking was twice repeated before he had finished .
Parsing [sent. 8554 len. 35]: Crackit went down to the door , and returned followed by a man with the lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief , and another tied over his head under his hat .
Parsing [sent. 8555 len. 6]: He drew them slowly off .
Parsing [sent. 8556 len. 31]: Blanched face , sunken eyes , hollow cheeks , beard of three days ' growth , wasted flesh , short thick breath ; it was the very ghost of Sikes .
Parsing [sent. 8557 len. 60]: He laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room , but shuddering as he was about to drop into it , and seeming to glance over his shoulder , dragged it back close to the wall -- as close as it would go -- and ground it against it -- and sat down .
Parsing [sent. 8558 len. 7]: Not a word had been exchanged .
Parsing [sent. 8559 len. 9]: He looked from one to another in silence .
Parsing [sent. 8560 len. 15]: If an eye were furtively raised and met his , it was instantly averted .
Parsing [sent. 8561 len. 12]: When his hollow voice broke silence , they all three started .
Parsing [sent. 8562 len. 10]: They seemed never to have heard its tones before .
Parsing [sent. 8563 len. 8]: ` How came that dog here ? '
Parsing [sent. 8564 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 8565 len. 3]: ` Alone .
Parsing [sent. 8566 len. 5]: Three hours ago . '
Parsing [sent. 8567 len. 10]: ` To-night 's paper says that Fagin 's took .
Parsing [sent. 8568 len. 9]: Is it true , or a lie ? '
Parsing [sent. 8569 len. 4]: ` True . '
Parsing [sent. 8570 len. 5]: They were silent again .
Parsing [sent. 8571 len. 6]: ` Damn you all ! '
Parsing [sent. 8572 len. 10]: said Sikes , passing his hand across his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 8573 len. 10]: ` Have you nothing to say to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 8574 len. 12]: There was an uneasy movement among them , but nobody spoke .
Parsing [sent. 8575 len. 38]: ` You that keep this house , ' said Sikes , turning his face to Crackit , ` do you mean to sell me , or to let me lie here till this hunt is over ? '
Parsing [sent. 8576 len. 22]: ` You may stop here , if you think it safe , ' returned the person addressed , after some hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 8577 len. 38]: Sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him : rather trying to turn his head than actually doing it : and said , ` Is -- it -- the body -- is it buried ? '
Parsing [sent. 8578 len. 5]: They shook their heads .
Parsing [sent. 8579 len. 7]: ` Why is n't it ! '
Parsing [sent. 8580 len. 9]: he retorted with the same glance behind him .
Parsing [sent. 8581 len. 13]: ` Wot do they keep such ugly things above the ground for ?
Parsing [sent. 8582 len. 7]: -- Who 's that knocking ? '
Parsing [sent. 8583 len. 32]: Crackit intimated , by a motion of his hand as he left the room , that there was nothing to fear ; and directly came back with Charley Bates behind him .
Parsing [sent. 8584 len. 20]: Sikes sat opposite the door , so that the moment the boy entered the room he encountered his figure .
Parsing [sent. 8585 len. 30]: ` Toby , ' said the boy falling back , as Sikes turned his eyes towards him , ` why did n't you tell me this , downstairs ? '
Parsing [sent. 8586 len. 26]: There had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the three , that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad .
Parsing [sent. 8587 len. 15]: Accordingly he nodded , and made as though he would shake hands with him .
Parsing [sent. 8588 len. 18]: ` Let me go into some other room , ' said the boy , retreating still farther .
Parsing [sent. 8589 len. 4]: ` Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 8590 len. 6]: said Sikes , stepping forward .
Parsing [sent. 8591 len. 12]: ` Do n't you -- do n't you know me ? '
Parsing [sent. 8592 len. 30]: ` Do n't come nearer me , ' answered the boy , still retreating , and looking , with horror in his eyes , upon the murderer 's face .
Parsing [sent. 8593 len. 5]: ` You monster ! '
Parsing [sent. 8594 len. 22]: The man stopped half-way , and they looked at each other ; but Sikes 's eyes sunk gradually to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 8595 len. 24]: ` Witness you three , ' cried the boy shaking his clenched fist , and becoming more and more excited as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 8596 len. 28]: ` Witness you three -- I 'm not afraid of him -- if they come here after him , I 'll give him up ; I will .
Parsing [sent. 8597 len. 7]: I tell you out at once .
Parsing [sent. 8598 len. 26]: He may kill me for it if he likes , or if he dares , but if I am here I 'll give him up .
Parsing [sent. 8599 len. 13]: I 'd give him up if he was to be boiled alive .
Parsing [sent. 8600 len. 2]: Murder !
Parsing [sent. 8601 len. 2]: Help !
Parsing [sent. 8602 len. 17]: If there 's the pluck of a man among you three , you 'll help me .
Parsing [sent. 8603 len. 2]: Murder !
Parsing [sent. 8604 len. 2]: Help !
Parsing [sent. 8605 len. 5]: Down with him ! '
Parsing [sent. 8606 len. 46]: Pouring out these cries , and accompanying them with violent gesticulation , the boy actually threw himself , single-handed , upon the strong man , and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of his surprise , brought him heavily to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 8607 len. 7]: The three spectators seemed quite stupefied .
Parsing [sent. 8608 len. 55]: They offered no interference , and the boy and man rolled on the ground together ; the former , heedless of the blows that showered upon him , wrenching his hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderer 's breast , and never ceasing to call for help with all his might .
Parsing [sent. 8609 len. 12]: The contest , however , was too unequal to last long .
Parsing [sent. 8610 len. 30]: Sikes had him down , and his knee was on his throat , when Crackit pulled him back with a look of alarm , and pointed to the window .
Parsing [sent. 8611 len. 31]: There were lights gleaming below , voices in loud and earnest conversation , the tramp of hurried footsteps -- endless they seemed in number -- crossing the nearest wooden bridge .
Parsing [sent. 8612 len. 24]: One man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd ; for there was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement .
Parsing [sent. 8613 len. 15]: The gleam of lights increased ; the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on .
Parsing [sent. 8614 len. 30]: Then , came a loud knocking at the door , and then a hoarse murmur from such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail .
Parsing [sent. 8615 len. 4]: ` Help ! '
Parsing [sent. 8616 len. 11]: shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air .
Parsing [sent. 8617 len. 5]: ` He 's here !
Parsing [sent. 8618 len. 6]: Break down the door ! '
Parsing [sent. 8619 len. 23]: ` In the King 's name , ' cried the voices without ; and the hoarse cry arose again , but louder .
Parsing [sent. 8620 len. 7]: ` Break down the door ! '
Parsing [sent. 8621 len. 5]: screamed the boy . '
Parsing [sent. 8622 len. 9]: I tell you they 'll never open it .
Parsing [sent. 8623 len. 10]: Run straight to the room where the light is .
Parsing [sent. 8624 len. 6]: Break down the door ! '
Parsing [sent. 8625 len. 45]: Strokes , thick and heavy , rattled upon the door and lower window-shutters as he ceased to speak , and a loud huzzah burst from the crowd ; giving the listener , for the first time , some adequate idea of its immense extent .
Parsing [sent. 8626 len. 42]: ` Open the door of some place where I can lock this screeching Hell-babe , ' cried Sikes fiercely ; running to and fro , and dragging the boy , now , as easily as if he were an empty sack .
Parsing [sent. 8627 len. 4]: ` That door .
Parsing [sent. 8628 len. 3]: Quick ! '
Parsing [sent. 8629 len. 13]: He flung him in , bolted it , and turned the key .
Parsing [sent. 8630 len. 8]: ` Is the downstairs door fast ? '
Parsing [sent. 8631 len. 24]: ` Double-locked and chained , ' replied Crackit , who , with the other two men , still remained quite helpless and bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 8632 len. 9]: ` The panels -- are they strong ? '
Parsing [sent. 8633 len. 6]: ` Lined with sheet-iron . '
Parsing [sent. 8634 len. 7]: ` And the windows too ? '
Parsing [sent. 8635 len. 8]: ` Yes , and the windows . '
Parsing [sent. 8636 len. 5]: ` Damn you ! '
Parsing [sent. 8637 len. 14]: cried the desperate ruffian , throwing up the sash and menacing the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 8638 len. 5]: ` Do your worst !
Parsing [sent. 8639 len. 7]: I 'll cheat you yet ! '
Parsing [sent. 8640 len. 22]: Of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears , none could exceed the cry of the infuriated throng .
Parsing [sent. 8641 len. 24]: Some shouted to those who were nearest to set the house on fire ; others roared to the officers to shoot him dead .
Parsing [sent. 8642 len. 62]: Among them all , none showed such fury as the man on horseback , who , throwing himself out of the saddle , and bursting through the crowd as if he were parting water , cried , beneath the window , in a voice that rose above all others , ` Twenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder ! '
Parsing [sent. 8643 len. 13]: The nearest voices took up the cry , and hundreds echoed it .
Parsing [sent. 8644 len. 110]: Some called for ladders , some for sledge-hammers ; some ran with torches to and fro as if to seek them , and still came back and roared again ; some spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations ; some pressed forward with the ecstasy of madmen , and thus impeded the progress of those below ; some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the water-spout and crevices in the wall ; and all waved to and fro , in the darkness beneath , like a field of corn moved by an angry wind : and joined from time to time in one loud furious roar .
Parsing [sent. 8645 len. 33]: ` The tide , ' cried the murderer , as he staggered back into the room , and shut the faces out , ` the tide was in as I came up .
Parsing [sent. 8646 len. 9]: Give me a rope , a long rope .
Parsing [sent. 8647 len. 6]: They 're all in front .
Parsing [sent. 8648 len. 14]: I may drop into the Folly Ditch , and clear off that way .
Parsing [sent. 8649 len. 16]: Give me a rope , or I shall do three more murders and kill myself .
Parsing [sent. 8650 len. 28]: The panic-stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept ; the murderer , hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord , hurried up to the house-top .
Parsing [sent. 8651 len. 42]: All the window in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up , except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked , and that was too small even for the passage of his body .
Parsing [sent. 8652 len. 67]: But , from this aperture , he had never ceased to call on those without , to guard the back ; and thus , when the murderer emerged at last on the house-top by the door in the roof , a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front , who immediately began to pour round , pressing upon each other in an unbroken stream .
Parsing [sent. 8653 len. 48]: He planted a board , which he had carried up with him for the purpose , so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty to open it from the inside ; and creeping over the tiles , looked over the low parapet .
Parsing [sent. 8654 len. 13]: The water was out , and the ditch a bed of mud .
Parsing [sent. 8655 len. 48]: The crowd had been hushed during these few moments , watching his motions and doubtful of his purpose , but the instant they perceived it and knew it was defeated , they raised a cry of triumphant execration to which all their previous shouting had been whispers .
Parsing [sent. 8656 len. 6]: Again and again it rose .
Parsing [sent. 8657 len. 39]: Those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning , took up the sound ; it echoed and re-echoed ; it seemed as though the whole city had poured its population out to curse him .
Parsing [sent. 8658 len. 46]: On pressed the people from the front -- on , on , on , in a strong struggling current of angry faces , with here and there a glaring torch to lighten them up , and show them out in all their wrath and passion .
Parsing [sent. 8659 len. 47]: The houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the mob ; sashes were thrown up , or torn bodily out ; there were tiers and tiers of faces in every window ; cluster upon cluster of people clinging to every house-top .
Parsing [sent. 8660 len. 21]: Each little bridge -LRB- and there were three in sight -RRB- bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it .
Parsing [sent. 8661 len. 27]: Still the current poured on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts , and only for an instant see the wretch .
Parsing [sent. 8662 len. 15]: ` They have him now , ' cried a man on the nearest bridge .
Parsing [sent. 8663 len. 4]: ` Hurrah ! '
Parsing [sent. 8664 len. 15]: The crowd grew light with uncovered heads ; and again the shout uprose . '
Parsing [sent. 8665 len. 25]: I will give fifty pounds , ' cried an old gentleman from the same quarter , ` to the man who takes him alive .
Parsing [sent. 8666 len. 15]: I will remain here , till he come to ask me for it . '
Parsing [sent. 8667 len. 5]: There was another roar .
Parsing [sent. 8668 len. 34]: At this moment the word was passed among the crowd that the door was forced at last , and that he who had first called for the ladder had mounted into the room .
Parsing [sent. 8669 len. 85]: The stream abruptly turned , as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth ; and the people at the windows , seeing those upon the bridges pouring back , quitted their stations , and running into the street , joined the concourse that now thronged pell-mell to the spot they had left : each man crushing and striving with his neighbor , and all panting with impatience to get near the door , and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out .
Parsing [sent. 8670 len. 91]: The cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation , or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion , were dreadful ; the narrow ways were completely blocked up ; and at this time , between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house , and the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the mass , the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer , although the universal eagerness for his capture was , if possible , increased .
Parsing [sent. 8671 len. 75]: The man had shrunk down , thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the crowd , and the impossibility of escape ; but seeing this sudden change with no less rapidity than it had occurred , he sprang upon his feet , determined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the ditch , and , at the risk of being stifled , endeavouring to creep away in the darkness and confusion .
Parsing [sent. 8672 len. 69]: Roused into new strength and energy , and stimulated by the noise within the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected , he set his foot against the stack of chimneys , fastened one end of the rope tightly and firmly round it , and with the other made a strong running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second .
Parsing [sent. 8673 len. 36]: He could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the ground than his own height , and had his knife ready in his hand to cut it then and drop .
Parsing [sent. 8674 len. 95]: At the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to slipping it beneath his arm-pits , and when the old gentleman before-mentioned -LRB- who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge as to resist the force of the crowd , and retain his position -RRB- earnestly warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself down -- at that very instant the murderer , looking behind him on the roof , threw his arms above his head , and uttered a yell of terror .
Parsing [sent. 8675 len. 6]: ` The eyes again ! '
Parsing [sent. 8676 len. 7]: he cried in an unearthly screech .
Parsing [sent. 8677 len. 17]: Staggering as if struck by lightning , he lost his balance and tumbled over the parapet .
Parsing [sent. 8678 len. 7]: The noose was on his neck .
Parsing [sent. 8679 len. 20]: It ran up with his weight , tight as a bow-string , and swift as the arrow it speeds .
Parsing [sent. 8680 len. 6]: He fell for five-and-thirty feet .
Parsing [sent. 8681 len. 28]: There was a sudden jerk , a terrific convulsion of the limbs ; and there he hung , with the open knife clenched in his stiffening hand .
Parsing [sent. 8682 len. 13]: The old chimney quivered with the shock , but stood it bravely .
Parsing [sent. 8683 len. 38]: The murderer swung lifeless against the wall ; and the boy , thrusting aside the dangling body which obscured his view , called to the people to come and take him out , for God 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 8684 len. 37]: A dog , which had lain concealed till now , ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl , and collecting himself for a spring , jumped for the dead man 's shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 8685 len. 30]: Missing his aim , he fell into the ditch , turning completely over as he went ; and striking his head against a stone , dashed out his brains .
Parsing [sent. 8686 len. 62]: CHAPTER LI AFFORDING AN EXPLANATION OF MORE MYSTERIES THAN ONE , AND COMPREHENDING A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE WITH NO WORD OF SETTLEMENT OR PIN -- MONEY The events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old , when Oliver found himself , at three o'clock in the afternoon , in a travelling-carriage rolling fast towards his native town .
Parsing [sent. 8687 len. 38]: Mrs. Maylie , and Rose , and Mrs. Bedwin , and the good doctor were with him : and Mr. Brownlow followed in a post-chaise , accompanied by one other person whose name had not been mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 8688 len. 57]: They had not talked much upon the way ; for Oliver was in a flutter of agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting his thoughts , and almost of speech , and appeared to have scarcely less effect on his companions , who shared it , in at least an equal degree .
Parsing [sent. 8689 len. 73]: He and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by Mr. Brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from Monks ; and although they knew that the object of their present journey was to complete the work which had been so well begun , still the whole matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in endurance of the most intense suspense .
Parsing [sent. 8690 len. 34]: The same kind friend had , with Mr. Losberne 's assistance , cautiously stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place .
Parsing [sent. 8691 len. 41]: ` It was quite true , ' he said , ` that they must know them before long , but it might be at a better time than the present , and it could not be at a worse . '
Parsing [sent. 8692 len. 36]: So , they travelled on in silence : each busied with reflections on the object which had brought them together : and no one disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all .
Parsing [sent. 8693 len. 85]: But if Oliver , under these influences , had remained silent while they journeyed towards his birth-place by a road he had never seen , how the whole current of his recollections ran back to old times , and what a crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast , when they turned into that which he had traversed on foot : a poor houseless , wandering boy , without a friend to help him , or a roof to shelter his head .
Parsing [sent. 8694 len. 7]: ` See there , there ! '
Parsing [sent. 8695 len. 47]: cried Oliver , eagerly clasping the hand of Rose , and pointing out at the carriage window ; ` that 's the stile I came over ; there are the hedges I crept behind , for fear any one should overtake me and force me back !
Parsing [sent. 8696 len. 20]: Yonder is the path across the fields , leading to the old house where I was a little child !
Parsing [sent. 8697 len. 19]: Oh Dick , Dick , my dear old friend , if I could only see you now ! '
Parsing [sent. 8698 len. 20]: ` You will see him soon , ' replied Rose , gently taking his folded hands between her own .
Parsing [sent. 8699 len. 39]: ` You shall tell him how happy you are , and how rich you have grown , and that in all your happiness you have none so great as the coming back to make him happy too . '
Parsing [sent. 8700 len. 50]: ` Yes , yes , ' said Oliver , ` and we 'll -- we 'll take him away from here , and have him clothed and taught , and send him to some quiet country place where he may grow strong and well , -- shall we ? '
Parsing [sent. 8701 len. 21]: Rose nodded ` yes , ' for the boy was smiling through such happy tears that she could not speak .
Parsing [sent. 8702 len. 21]: ` You will be kind and good to him , for you are to every one , ' said Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 8703 len. 55]: ` It will make you cry , I know , to hear what he can tell ; but never mind , never mind , it will be all over , and you will smile again -- I know that too -- to think how changed he is ; you did the same with me .
Parsing [sent. 8704 len. 48]: He said `` God bless you '' to me when I ran away , ' cried the boy with a burst of affectionate emotion ; ` and I will say `` God bless you '' now , and show him how I love him for it ! '
Parsing [sent. 8705 len. 30]: As they approached the town , and at length drove through its narrow streets , it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy within reasonable bounds .
Parsing [sent. 8706 len. 169]: There was Sowerberry 's the undertaker 's just as it used to be , only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he remembered it -- there were all the well-known shops and houses , with almost every one of which he had some slight incident connected -- there was Gamfield 's cart , the very cart he used to have , standing at the old public-house door -- there was the workhouse , the dreary prison of his youthful days , with its dismal windows frowning on the street -- there was the same lean porter standing at the gate , at sight of whom Oliver involuntarily shrunk back , and then laughed at himself for being so foolish , then cried , then laughed again -- there were scores of faces at the doors and windows that he knew quite well -- there was nearly everything as if he had left it but yesterday , and all his recent life had been but a happy dream .
Parsing [sent. 8707 len. 10]: But it was pure , earnest , joyful reality .
Parsing [sent. 8708 len. 137]: They drove straight to the door of the chief hotel -LRB- which Oliver used to stare up at , with awe , and think a mighty palace , but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur and size -RRB- ; and here was Mr. Grimwig all ready to receive them , kissing the young lady , and the old one too , when they got out of the coach , as if he were the grandfather of the whole party , all smiles and kindness , and not offering to eat his head -- no , not once ; not even when he contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to London , and maintained he knew it best , though he had only come that way once , and that time fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 8709 len. 20]: There was dinner prepared , and there were bedrooms ready , and everything was arranged as if by magic .
Parsing [sent. 8710 len. 27]: Notwithstanding all this , when the hurry of the first half-hour was over , the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their journey down .
Parsing [sent. 8711 len. 16]: Mr. Brownlow did not join them at dinner , but remained in a separate room .
Parsing [sent. 8712 len. 26]: The two other gentlemen hurried in and out with anxious faces , and , during the short intervals when they were present , conversed apart .
Parsing [sent. 8713 len. 24]: Once , Mrs. Maylie was called away , and after being absent for nearly an hour , returned with eyes swollen with weeping .
Parsing [sent. 8714 len. 20]: All these things made Rose and Oliver , who were not in any new secrets , nervous and uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 8715 len. 34]: They sat wondering , in silence ; or , if they exchanged a few words , spoke in whispers , as if they were afraid to hear the sound of their own voices .
Parsing [sent. 8716 len. 84]: At length , when nine o'clock had come , and they began to think they were to hear no more that night , Mr. Losberne and Mr. Grimwig entered the room , followed by Mr. Brownlow and a man whom Oliver almost shrieked with surprise to see ; for they told him it was his brother , and it was the same man he had met at the market-town , and seen looking in with Fagin at the window of his little room .
Parsing [sent. 8717 len. 29]: Monks cast a look of hate , which , even then , he could not dissemble , at the astonished boy , and sat down near the door .
Parsing [sent. 8718 len. 22]: Mr. Brownlow , who had papers in his hand , walked to a table near which Rose and Oliver were seated .
Parsing [sent. 8719 len. 32]: ` This is a painful task , ' said he , ` but these declarations , which have been signed in London before many gentlemen , must be substance repeated here .
Parsing [sent. 8720 len. 27]: I would have spared you the degradation , but we must hear them from your own lips before we part , and you know why . '
Parsing [sent. 8721 len. 15]: ` Go on , ' said the person addressed , turning away his face .
Parsing [sent. 8722 len. 3]: ` Quick .
Parsing [sent. 8723 len. 9]: I have almost done enough , I think .
Parsing [sent. 8724 len. 7]: Do n't keep me here . '
Parsing [sent. 8725 len. 54]: ` This child , ' said Mr. Brownlow , drawing Oliver to him , and laying his hand upon his head , ` is your half-brother ; the illegitimate son of your father , my dear friend Edwin Leeford , by poor young Agnes Fleming , who died in giving him birth . '
Parsing [sent. 8726 len. 23]: ` Yes , ' said Monks , scowling at the trembling boy : the beating of whose heart he might have heard .
Parsing [sent. 8727 len. 8]: ` That is the bastard child . '
Parsing [sent. 8728 len. 30]: ` The term you use , ' said Mr. Brownlow , sternly , ` is a reproach to those long since passed beyong the feeble censure of the world .
Parsing [sent. 8729 len. 14]: It reflects disgrace on no one living , except you who use it .
Parsing [sent. 8730 len. 4]: Let that pass .
Parsing [sent. 8731 len. 8]: He was born in this town . '
Parsing [sent. 8732 len. 14]: ` In the workhouse of this town , ' was the sullen reply .
Parsing [sent. 8733 len. 8]: ` You have the story there . '
Parsing [sent. 8734 len. 11]: He pointed impatiently to the papers as he spoke . '
Parsing [sent. 8735 len. 19]: I must have it here , too , ' said Mr. Brownlow , looking round upon the listeners .
Parsing [sent. 8736 len. 4]: ` Listen then !
Parsing [sent. 8737 len. 3]: You ! '
Parsing [sent. 8738 len. 3]: returned Monks .
Parsing [sent. 8739 len. 61]: ` His father being taken ill at Rome , was joined by his wife , my mother , from whom he had been long separated , who went from Paris and took me with her -- to look after his property , for what I know , for she had no great affection for him , nor he for her .
Parsing [sent. 8740 len. 24]: He knew nothing of us , for his senses were gone , and he slumbered on till next day , when he died .
Parsing [sent. 8741 len. 65]: Among the papers in his desk , were two , dated on the night his illness first came on , directed to yourself ' ; he addressed himself to Mr. Brownlow ; ` and enclosed in a few short lines to you , with an intimation on the cover of the package that it was not to be forwarded till after he was dead .
Parsing [sent. 8742 len. 18]: One of these papers was a letter to this girl Agnes ; the other a will . '
Parsing [sent. 8743 len. 7]: ` What of the letter ? '
Parsing [sent. 8744 len. 4]: asked Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 8745 len. 4]: ` The letter ?
Parsing [sent. 8746 len. 23]: -- A sheet of paper crossed and crossed again , with a penitent confession , and prayers to God to help her .
Parsing [sent. 8747 len. 54]: He had palmed a tale on the girl that some secret mystery -- to be explained one day -- prevented his marrying her just then ; and so she had gone on , trusting patiently to him , until she trusted too far , and lost what none could ever give her back .
Parsing [sent. 8748 len. 15]: She was , at that time , within a few months of her confinement .
Parsing [sent. 8749 len. 58]: He told her all he had meant to do , to hide her shame , if he had lived , and prayed her , if he died , not to curse him memory , or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on her or their young child ; for all the guilt was his .
Parsing [sent. 8750 len. 85]: He reminded her of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her christian name engraved upon it , and a blank left for that which he hoped one day to have bestowed upon her -- prayed her yet to keep it , and wear it next her heart , as she had done before -- and then ran on , wildly , in the same words , over and over again , as if he had gone distracted .
Parsing [sent. 8751 len. 6]: I believe he had . '
Parsing [sent. 8752 len. 16]: ` The will , ' said Mr. Brownlow , as Oliver 's tears fell fast .
Parsing [sent. 8753 len. 4]: Monks was silent .
Parsing [sent. 8754 len. 23]: ` The will , ' said Mr. Brownlow , speaking for him , ` was in the same spirit as the letter .
Parsing [sent. 8755 len. 55]: He talked of miseries which his wife had brought upon him ; of the rebellious disposition , vice , malice , and premature bad passions of you his only son , who had been trained to hate him ; and left you , and your mother , each an annuity of eight hundred pounds .
Parsing [sent. 8756 len. 37]: The bulk of his property he divided into two equal portions -- one for Agnes Fleming , and the other for their child , it it should be born alive , and ever come of age .
Parsing [sent. 8757 len. 48]: If it were a girl , it was to inherit the money unconditionally ; but if a boy , only on the stipulation that in his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act of dishonour , meanness , cowardice , or wrong .
Parsing [sent. 8758 len. 38]: He did this , he said , to mark his confidence in the other , and his conviction -- only strengthened by approaching death -- that the child would share her gentle heart , and noble nature .
Parsing [sent. 8759 len. 63]: If he were disappointed in this expectation , then the money was to come to you : for then , and not till then , when both children were equal , would he recognise your prior claim upon his purse , who had none upon his heart , but had , from an infant , repulsed him with coldness and aversion . '
Parsing [sent. 8760 len. 22]: ` My mother , ' said Monks , in a louder tone , ` did what a woman should have done .
Parsing [sent. 8761 len. 5]: She burnt this will .
Parsing [sent. 8762 len. 28]: The letter never reached its destination ; but that , and other proofs , she kept , in case they ever tried to lie away the blot .
Parsing [sent. 8763 len. 27]: The girl 's father had the truth from her with every aggravation that her violent hate -- I love her for it now -- could add .
Parsing [sent. 8764 len. 47]: Goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his children into a remote corner of Wales , changing his very name that his friends might never know of his retreat ; and here , no great while afterwards , he was found dead in his bed .
Parsing [sent. 8765 len. 61]: The girl had left her home , in secret , some weeks before ; he had searched for her , on foot , in every town and village near ; it was on the night when he returned home , assured that she had destroyed herself , to hide her shame and his , that his old heart broke . '
Parsing [sent. 8766 len. 18]: There was a short silence here , until Mr. Brownlow took up the thread of the narrative .
Parsing [sent. 8767 len. 23]: ` Years after this , ' he said , ` this man 's -- Edward Leeford 's -- mother came to me .
Parsing [sent. 8768 len. 39]: He had left her , when only eighteen ; robbed her of jewels and money ; gambled , squandered , forged , and fled to London : where for two years he had associated with the lowest outcasts .
Parsing [sent. 8769 len. 19]: She was sinking under a painful and incurable disease , and wished to recover him before she died .
Parsing [sent. 8770 len. 11]: Inquiries were set on foot , and strict searches made .
Parsing [sent. 8771 len. 21]: They were unavailing for a long time , but ultimately successful ; and he went back with her to France .
Parsing [sent. 8772 len. 58]: ` There she died , ' said Monks , ` after a lingering illness ; and , on her death-bed , she bequeathed these secrets to me , together with her unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved -- though she need not have left me that , for I had inherited it long before .
Parsing [sent. 8773 len. 34]: She would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself , and the child too , but was filled with the impression that a male child had been born , and was alive .
Parsing [sent. 8774 len. 69]: I swore to her , if ever it crossed my path , to hunt it down ; never to let it rest ; to pursue it with the bitterest and most unrelenting animosity ; to vent upon it the hatred that I deeply felt , and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by draggin it , if I could , to the very gallows-foot .
Parsing [sent. 8775 len. 4]: She was right .
Parsing [sent. 8776 len. 8]: He came in my way at last .
Parsing [sent. 8777 len. 20]: I began well ; and , but for babbling drabs , I would have finished as I began ! '
Parsing [sent. 8778 len. 96]: As the villain folded his arms tight together , and muttered curses on himself in the impotence of baffled malice , Mr. Brownlow turned to the terrified group beside him , and explained that the Jew , who had been his old accomplice and confidant , had a large reward for keeping Oliver ensnared : of which some part was to be given up , in the event of his being rescued : and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit to the country house for the purpose of identifying him .
Parsing [sent. 8779 len. 7]: ` The locket and ring ? '
Parsing [sent. 8780 len. 9]: said Mr. Brownlow , turning to Monks . '
Parsing [sent. 8781 len. 35]: I bought them from the man and woman I told you of , who stole them from the nurse , who stole them from the corpse , ' answered Monks without raising his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8782 len. 9]: ` You know what became of them . '
Parsing [sent. 8783 len. 30]: Mr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig , who disappearing with great alacrity , shortly returned , pushing in Mrs. Bumble , and dragging her unwilling consort after him .
Parsing [sent. 8784 len. 9]: ` Do my hi 's deceive me ! '
Parsing [sent. 8785 len. 15]: cried Mr. Bumble , with ill-feigned enthusiasm , ` or is that little Oliver ?
Parsing [sent. 8786 len. 28]: Oh O-li-ver , if you know 'd how I 've been a-grieving for you -- ' ` Hold your tongue , fool , ' murmured Mrs. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 8787 len. 11]: ` Is n't natur , natur , Mrs. Bumble ? '
Parsing [sent. 8788 len. 5]: remonstrated the workhouse master .
Parsing [sent. 8789 len. 32]: ` Ca n't I be supposed to feel -- I as brought him up porochially -- when I see him a-setting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affablest description !
Parsing [sent. 8790 len. 29]: I always loved that boy as if he 'd been my -- my -- my own grandfather , ' said Mr. Bumble , halting for an appropriate comparison .
Parsing [sent. 8791 len. 17]: ` Master Oliver , my dear , you remember the blessed gentleman in the white waistcoat ?
Parsing [sent. 8792 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 8793 len. 18]: he went to heaven last week , in a oak coffin with plated handles , Oliver . '
Parsing [sent. 8794 len. 19]: ` Come , sir , ' said Mr. Grimwig , tartly ; ` suppress your feelings . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8795 len. 13]: I will do my endeavours , sir , ' replied Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 8796 len. 8]: ` How do you do , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 8797 len. 8]: I hope you are very well . '
Parsing [sent. 8798 len. 22]: This salutation was addressed to Mr. Brownlow , who had stepped up to within a short distance of the respectable couple .
Parsing [sent. 8799 len. 17]: He inquired , as he pointed to Monks , ` Do you know that person ? '
Parsing [sent. 8800 len. 9]: ` No , ' replied Mrs. Bumble flatly .
Parsing [sent. 8801 len. 7]: ` Perhaps YOU do n't ? '
Parsing [sent. 8802 len. 9]: said Mr. Brownlow , addressing her spouse . '
Parsing [sent. 8803 len. 14]: I never saw him in all my life , ' said Mr. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 8804 len. 9]: ` Nor sold him anything , perhaps ? '
Parsing [sent. 8805 len. 8]: ` No , ' replied Mrs. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 8806 len. 15]: ` You never had , perhaps , a certain gold locket and ring ? '
Parsing [sent. 8807 len. 4]: said Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 8808 len. 9]: ` Certainly not , ' replied the matron .
Parsing [sent. 8809 len. 15]: ` Why are we brought here to answer to such nonsense as this ? '
Parsing [sent. 8810 len. 18]: Again Mr. Brownlow nodded to Mr. Grimwig ; and again that gentleman limped away with extraordinary readiness .
Parsing [sent. 8811 len. 32]: But not again did he return with a stout man and wife ; for this time , he led in two palsied women , who shook and tottered as they walked .
Parsing [sent. 8812 len. 38]: ` You shut the door the night old Sally died , ' said the foremost one , raising her shrivelled hand , ` but you could n't shut out the sound , nor stop the chinks . '
Parsing [sent. 8813 len. 19]: ` No , no , ' said the other , looking round her and wagging her toothless jaws .
Parsing [sent. 8814 len. 8]: ` No , no , no . '
Parsing [sent. 8815 len. 42]: ` We heard her try to tell you what she 'd done , and saw you take a paper from her hand , and watched you too , next day , to the pawnbroker 's shop , ' said the first .
Parsing [sent. 8816 len. 20]: ` Yes , ' added the second , ` and it was a `` locket and gold ring . ''
Parsing [sent. 8817 len. 11]: We found out that , and saw it given you .
Parsing [sent. 8818 len. 4]: We were by .
Parsing [sent. 8819 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8820 len. 5]: we were by . '
Parsing [sent. 8821 len. 68]: ` And we know more than that , ' resumed the first , ` for she told us often , long ago , that the young mother had told her that , feeling she should never get over it , she was on her way , at the time that she was taken ill , to die near the grave of the father of the child . '
Parsing [sent. 8822 len. 11]: ` Would you like to see the pawnbroker himself ? '
Parsing [sent. 8823 len. 10]: asked Mr. Grimwig with a motion towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 8824 len. 53]: ` No , ' replied the woman ; ` if he -- she pointed to Monks -- ` has been coward enough to confess , as I see he had , and you have sounded all these hags till you have found the right ones , I have nothing more to say .
Parsing [sent. 8825 len. 15]: I DID sell them , and they 're where you 'll never get them .
Parsing [sent. 8826 len. 4]: What then ? '
Parsing [sent. 8827 len. 31]: ` Nothing , ' replied Mr. Brownlow , ` except that it remains for us to take care that neither of you is employed in a situation of trust again .
Parsing [sent. 8828 len. 8]: You may leave the room . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8829 len. 43]: I hope , ' said Mr. Bumble , looking about him with great ruefulness , as Mr. Grimwig disappeared with the two old women : ' I hope that this unfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial office ? '
Parsing [sent. 8830 len. 10]: ` Indeed it will , ' replied Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 8831 len. 18]: ` You may make up your mind to that , and think yourself well off besides . '
Parsing [sent. 8832 len. 7]: ` It was all Mrs. Bumble .
Parsing [sent. 8833 len. 23]: She WOULD do it , ' urged Mr. Bumble ; first looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room .
Parsing [sent. 8834 len. 11]: ` That is no excuse , ' replied Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 8835 len. 44]: ` You were present on the occasion of the destruction of these trinkets , and indeed are the more guilty of the two , in the eye of the law ; for the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction . '
Parsing [sent. 8836 len. 30]: ` If the law supposes that , ' said Mr. Bumble , squeezing his hat emphatically in both hands , ` the law is a ass -- a idiot .
Parsing [sent. 8837 len. 37]: If that 's the eye of the law , the law is a bachelor ; and the worst I wish the law is , that his eye may be opened by experience -- by experience . '
Parsing [sent. 8838 len. 33]: Laying great stress on the repetition of these two words , Mr. Bumble fixed his hat on very tight , and putting his hands in his pockets , followed his helpmate downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 8839 len. 19]: ` Young lady , ' said Mr. Brownlow , turning to Rose , ` give me your hand .
Parsing [sent. 8840 len. 4]: Do not tremble .
Parsing [sent. 8841 len. 16]: You need not fear to hear the few remaining words we have to say . '
Parsing [sent. 8842 len. 38]: ` If they have -- I do not know how they can , but if they have -- any reference to me , ' said Rose , ` pray let me hear them at some other time .
Parsing [sent. 8843 len. 9]: I have not strength or spirits now . '
Parsing [sent. 8844 len. 27]: ` Nay , ' returned the old gentlman , drawing her arm through his ; ` you have more fortitude than this , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 8845 len. 10]: Do you know this young lady , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8846 len. 8]: ` Yes , ' replied Monks . '
Parsing [sent. 8847 len. 12]: I never saw you before , ' said Rose faintly . '
Parsing [sent. 8848 len. 10]: I have seen you often , ' returned Monks .
Parsing [sent. 8849 len. 16]: ` The father of the unhappy Agnes had TWO daughters , ' said Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 8850 len. 13]: ` What was the fate of the other -- the child ? '
Parsing [sent. 8851 len. 65]: ` The child , ' replied Monks , ` when her father died in a strange place , in a strange name , without a letter , book , or scrap of paper that yielded the faintest clue by which his friends or relatives could be traced -- the child was taken by some wretched cottagers , who reared it as their own . '
Parsing [sent. 8852 len. 16]: ` Go on , ' said Mr. Brownlow , signing to Mrs. Maylie to approach .
Parsing [sent. 8853 len. 5]: ` Go on ! '
Parsing [sent. 8854 len. 31]: ` You could n't find the spot to which these people had repaired , ' said Monks , ` but where friendship fails , hatred will often force a way .
Parsing [sent. 8855 len. 20]: My mother found it , after a year of cunning search -- ay , and found the child . '
Parsing [sent. 8856 len. 9]: ` She took it , did she ? '
Parsing [sent. 8857 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 8858 len. 51]: The people were poor and began to sicken -- at least the man did -- of their fine humanity ; so she left it with them , giving them a small present of money which would not last long , and promised more , which she never meant to send .
Parsing [sent. 8859 len. 71]: She did n't quite rely , however , on their discontent and poverty for the child 's unhappiness , but told the history of the sister 's shame , with such alterations as suited her ; bade them take good heed of the child , for she came of bad blood ; ; and told them she was illegitimate , and sure to go wrong at one time or other .
Parsing [sent. 8860 len. 53]: The circumstances countenanced all this ; the people believed it ; and there the child dragged on an existence , miserable enough even to satisfy us , until a widow lady , residing , then , at Chester , saw the girl by chance , pitied her , and took her home .
Parsing [sent. 8861 len. 26]: There was some cursed spell , I think , against us ; for in spite of all our efforts she remained there and was happy .
Parsing [sent. 8862 len. 24]: I lost sight of her , two or three years ago , and saw her no more until a few months back . '
Parsing [sent. 8863 len. 8]: ` Do you see her now ? '
Parsing [sent. 8864 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8865 len. 6]: Leaning on your arm . '
Parsing [sent. 8866 len. 29]: ` But not the less my niece , ' cried Mrs. Maylie , folding the fainting girl in her arms ; ` not the less my dearest child .
Parsing [sent. 8867 len. 15]: I would not lose her now , for all the treasures of the world .
Parsing [sent. 8868 len. 10]: My sweet companion , my own dear girl ! '
Parsing [sent. 8869 len. 16]: ` The only friend I ever had , ' cried Rose , clinging to her .
Parsing [sent. 8870 len. 8]: ` The kindest , best of friends .
Parsing [sent. 8871 len. 5]: My heart will burst .
Parsing [sent. 8872 len. 8]: I can not bear all this . '
Parsing [sent. 8873 len. 37]: ` You have borne more , and have been , through all , the best and gentlest creature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew , ' said Mrs. Maylie , embracing her tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 8874 len. 24]: ` Come , come , my love , remember who this is who waits to clasp you in his arms , poor child !
Parsing [sent. 8875 len. 11]: See here -- look , look , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 8876 len. 43]: ` Not aunt , ' cried Oliver , throwing his arms about her neck ; ` I 'll never call her aunt -- sister , my own dear sister , that something taught my heart to love so dearly from the first !
Parsing [sent. 8877 len. 8]: Rose , dear , darling Rose ! '
Parsing [sent. 8878 len. 25]: Let the tears which fell , and the broken words which were exchanged in the long close embrace between the orphans , be sacred .
Parsing [sent. 8879 len. 19]: A father , sister , and mother , were gained , and lost , in that one moment .
Parsing [sent. 8880 len. 47]: Joy and grief were mingled in the cup ; but there were no bitter tears : for even grief itself arose so softened , and clothed in such sweet and tender recollections , that it became a solemn pleasure , and lost all character of pain .
Parsing [sent. 8881 len. 9]: They were a long , long time alone .
Parsing [sent. 8882 len. 16]: A soft tap at the door , at length announced that some one was without .
Parsing [sent. 8883 len. 15]: Oliver opened it , glided away , and gave place to Harry Maylie . '
Parsing [sent. 8884 len. 17]: I know it all , ' he said , taking a seat beside the lovely girl .
Parsing [sent. 8885 len. 11]: ` Dear Rose , I know it all . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8886 len. 33]: I am not here by accident , ' he added after a lengthened silence ; ` nor have I heard all this to-night , for I knew it yesterday -- only yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 8887 len. 15]: Do you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise ? '
Parsing [sent. 8888 len. 7]: ` Stay , ' said Rose .
Parsing [sent. 8889 len. 7]: ` You DO know all . '
Parsing [sent. 8890 len. 3]: ` All .
Parsing [sent. 8891 len. 23]: You gave me leave , at any time within a year , to renew the subject of our last discourse . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8892 len. 4]: I did . '
Parsing [sent. 8893 len. 28]: ` Not to press you to alter your determination , ' pursued the young man , ` but to hear you repeat it , if you would .
Parsing [sent. 8894 len. 43]: I was to lay whatever of station or fortune I might possess at your feet , and if you still adhered to your former determination , I pledged myself , by no word or act , to seek to change it . '
Parsing [sent. 8895 len. 19]: ` The same reasons which influenced me then , will influence me know , ' said Rose firmly .
Parsing [sent. 8896 len. 37]: ` If I ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her , whose goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering , when should I ever feel it , as I should to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 8897 len. 31]: It is a struggle , ' said Rose , ` but one I am proud to make ; it is a pang , but one my heart shall bear . '
Parsing [sent. 8898 len. 11]: ` The disclosure of to-night , ' -- Harry began .
Parsing [sent. 8899 len. 33]: ` The disclosure of to-night , ' replied Rose softly , ` leaves me in the same position , with reference to you , as that in which I stood before . '
Parsing [sent. 8900 len. 15]: ` You harden your heart against me , Rose , ' urged her lover .
Parsing [sent. 8901 len. 29]: ` Oh Harry , Harry , ' said the young lady , bursting into tears ; ' I wish I could , and spare myself this pain . '
Parsing [sent. 8902 len. 9]: ` Then why inflict it on yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 8903 len. 7]: said Harry , taking her hand .
Parsing [sent. 8904 len. 14]: ` Think , dear Rose , think what you have heard to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 8905 len. 7]: ` And what have I heard !
Parsing [sent. 8906 len. 6]: What have I heard ! '
Parsing [sent. 8907 len. 3]: cried Rose .
Parsing [sent. 8908 len. 34]: ` That a sense of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned all -- there , we have said enough , Harry , we have said enough . '
Parsing [sent. 8909 len. 19]: ` Not yet , not yet , ' said the young man , detaining her as she rose .
Parsing [sent. 8910 len. 26]: ` My hopes , my wishes , prospects , feeling : every thought in life except my love for you : have undergone a change .
Parsing [sent. 8911 len. 68]: I offer you , now , no distinction among a bustling crowd ; no mingling with a world of malice and detraction , where the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught but real disgrace and shame ; but a home -- a heart and home -- yes , dearest Rose , and those , and those alone , are all I have to offer . '
Parsing [sent. 8912 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ! '
Parsing [sent. 8913 len. 4]: she faltered . '
Parsing [sent. 8914 len. 64]: I mean but this -- that when I left you last , I left you with a firm determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me ; resolved that if my world could not be yours , I would make yours mine ; that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you , for I would turn from it .
Parsing [sent. 8915 len. 5]: This I have done .
Parsing [sent. 8916 len. 22]: Those who have shrunk from me because of this , have shrunk from you , and proved you so far right .
Parsing [sent. 8917 len. 49]: Such power and patronage : such relatives of influence and rank : as smiled upon me then , look coldly now ; but there are smiling fields and waving trees in England 's richest county ; and by one village church -- mine , Rose , my own !
Parsing [sent. 8918 len. 26]: -- there stands a rustic dwelling which you can make me prouder of , than all the hopes I have renounced , measured a thousandfold .
Parsing [sent. 8919 len. 16]: This is my rank and station now , and here I lay it down ! '
Parsing [sent. 8920 len. 35]: * * * * * * * ` It 's a trying thing waiting supper for lovers , ' said Mr. Grimwig , waking up , and pulling his pocket-handkerchief from over his head .
Parsing [sent. 8921 len. 14]: Truth to tell , the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable time .
Parsing [sent. 8922 len. 25]: Neither Mrs. Maylie , nor Harry , nor Rose -LRB- who all came in together -RRB- , could offer a word in extenuation . '
Parsing [sent. 8923 len. 27]: I had serious thoughts of eating my head to-night , ' said Mr. Grimwig , ` for I began to think I should get nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 8924 len. 22]: I 'll take the liberty , if you 'll allow me , of saluting the bride that is to be . '
Parsing [sent. 8925 len. 70]: Mr. Grimwig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon the blushing girl ; and the example , being contagious , was followed both by the doctor and Mr. Brownlow : some people affirm that Harry Maylie had been observed to set it , orginally , in a dark room adjoining ; but the best authorities consider this downright scandal : he being young and a clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 8926 len. 25]: ` Oliver , my child , ' said Mrs. Maylie , ` where have you been , and why do you look so sad ?
Parsing [sent. 8927 len. 11]: There are tears stealing down your face at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 8928 len. 6]: What is the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 8929 len. 25]: It is a world of disappointment : often to the hopes we most cherish , and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour .
Parsing [sent. 8930 len. 5]: Poor Dick was dead !
Parsing [sent. 8931 len. 21]: CHAPTER LII FAGIN 'S LAST NIGHT ALIVE The court was paved , from floor to roof , with human faces .
Parsing [sent. 8932 len. 11]: Inquisitive and eager eyes peered from every inch of space .
Parsing [sent. 8933 len. 30]: From the rail before the dock , away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the galleries , all looks were fixed upon one man -- Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 8934 len. 32]: Before him and behind : above , below , on the right and on the left : he seemed to stand surrounded by a firmament , all bright with gleaming eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8935 len. 61]: He stood there , in all this glare of living light , with one hand resting on the wooden slab before him , the other held to his ear , and his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge , who was delivering his charge to the jury .
Parsing [sent. 8936 len. 55]: At times , he turned his eyes sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight in his favour ; and when the points against him were stated with terrible distinctness , looked towards his counsel , in mute appeal that he would , even then , urge something in his behalf .
Parsing [sent. 8937 len. 13]: Beyond these manifestations of anxiety , he stirred not hand or foot .
Parsing [sent. 8938 len. 43]: He had scarcely moved since the trial began ; and now that the judge ceased to speak , he still remained in the same strained attitude of close attention , with his gaze ben on him , as though he listened still .
Parsing [sent. 8939 len. 12]: A slight bustle in the court , recalled him to himself .
Parsing [sent. 8940 len. 17]: Looking round , he saw that the juryman had turned together , to consider their verdict .
Parsing [sent. 8941 len. 42]: As his eyes wandered to the gallery , he could see the people rising above each other to see his face : some hastily applying their glasses to their eyes : and others whispering their neighbours with looks expressive of abhorrence .
Parsing [sent. 8942 len. 26]: A few there were , who seemed unmindful of him , and looked only to the jury , in impatient wonder how they could delay .
Parsing [sent. 8943 len. 42]: But in no one face -- not even among the women , of whom there were many there -- could he read the faintest sympathy with himself , or any feeling but one of all-absorbing interest that he should be condemned .
Parsing [sent. 8944 len. 30]: As he saw all this in one bewildered glance , the deathlike stillness came again , and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards the judge .
Parsing [sent. 8945 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 8946 len. 7]: They only sought permission to retire .
Parsing [sent. 8947 len. 33]: He looked , wistfully , into their faces , one by one when they passed out , as though to see which way the greater number leant ; but that was fruitless .
Parsing [sent. 8948 len. 8]: The jailed touched him on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 8949 len. 17]: He followed mechanically to the end of the dock , and sat down on a chair .
Parsing [sent. 8950 len. 14]: The man pointed it out , or he would not have seen it .
Parsing [sent. 8951 len. 8]: He looked up into the gallery again .
Parsing [sent. 8952 len. 22]: Some of the people were eating , and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs ; for the crowded place was very hot .
Parsing [sent. 8953 len. 13]: There was one young man sketching his face in a little note-book .
Parsing [sent. 8954 len. 32]: He wondered whether it was like , and looked on when the artist broke his pencil-point , and made another with his knife , as any idle spectator might have done .
Parsing [sent. 8955 len. 39]: In the same way , when he turned his eyes towards the judge , his mind began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress , and what it cost , and how he put it on .
Parsing [sent. 8956 len. 28]: There was an old fat gentleman on the bench , too , who had gone out , some half an hour before , and now come back .
Parsing [sent. 8957 len. 44]: He wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner , what he had had , and where he had had it ; and pursued this train of careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused another .
Parsing [sent. 8958 len. 55]: Not that , all this time , his mind was , for an instant , free from one oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet ; it was ever present to him , but in a vague and general way , and he could not fix his thoughts upon it .
Parsing [sent. 8959 len. 54]: Thus , even while he trembled , and turned burning hot at the idea of speedy death , he fell to counting the iron spikes before him , and wondering how the head of one had been broken off , and whether they would mend it , or leave it as it was .
Parsing [sent. 8960 len. 36]: Then , he thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold -- and stopped to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool it -- and then went on to think again .
Parsing [sent. 8961 len. 19]: At length there was a cry of silence , and a breathless look from all towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 8962 len. 9]: The jury returned , and passed him close .
Parsing [sent. 8963 len. 17]: He could glean nothing from their faces ; they might as well have been of stone .
Parsing [sent. 8964 len. 14]: Perfect stillness ensued -- not a rustle -- not a breath -- Guilty .
Parsing [sent. 8965 len. 33]: The building rang with a tremendous shout , and another , and another , and then it echoed loud groans , that gathered strength as they swelled out , like angry thunder .
Parsing [sent. 8966 len. 21]: It was a peal of joy from the populace outside , greeting the news that he would die on Monday .
Parsing [sent. 8967 len. 25]: The noise subsided , and he was asked if he had anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon him .
Parsing [sent. 8968 len. 59]: He had resumed his listening attitude , and looked intently at his questioner while the demand was made ; but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it , and then he only muttered that he was an old man -- an old man -- and so , dropping into a whisper , was silent again .
Parsing [sent. 8969 len. 19]: The judge assumed the black cap , and the prisoner still stood with the same air and gesture .
Parsing [sent. 8970 len. 35]: A woman in the gallery , uttered some exclamation , called forth by this dread solemnity ; he looked hastily up as if angry at the interruption , and bent forward yet more attentively .
Parsing [sent. 8971 len. 13]: The address was solemn and impressive ; the sentence fearful to hear .
Parsing [sent. 8972 len. 16]: But he stood , like a marble figure , without the motion of a nerve .
Parsing [sent. 8973 len. 36]: His haggard face was still thrust forward , his under-jaw hanging down , and his eyes staring out before him , when the jailer put his hand upon his arm , and beckoned him away .
Parsing [sent. 8974 len. 12]: He gazed stupidly about him for an instant , and obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 8975 len. 41]: They led him through a paved room under the court , where some prisoners were waiting till their turns came , and others were talking to their friends , who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard .
Parsing [sent. 8976 len. 47]: There was nobody there to speak to HIM ; but , as he passed , the prisoners fell back to render him more visible to the people who were clinging to the bars : and they assailed him with opprobrious names , and screeched and hissed .
Parsing [sent. 8977 len. 37]: He shook his fist , and would have spat upon them ; but his conductors hurried him on , through a gloomy passage lighted by a few dim lamps , into the interior of the prison .
Parsing [sent. 8978 len. 41]: Here , he was searched , that he might not have about him the means of anticipating the law ; this ceremony performed , they led him to one of the condemned cells , and left him there -- alone .
Parsing [sent. 8979 len. 33]: He sat down on a stone bench opposite the door , which served for seat and bedstead ; and casting his blood-shot eyes upon the ground , tried to collect his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 8980 len. 37]: After awhile , he began to remember a few disjointed fragments of what the judge had said : though it had seemed to him , at the time , that he could not hear a word .
Parsing [sent. 8981 len. 31]: These gradually fell into their proper places , and by degrees suggested more : so that in a little time he had the whole , almost as it was delivered .
Parsing [sent. 8982 len. 17]: To be hanged by the neck , till he was dead -- that was the end .
Parsing [sent. 8983 len. 11]: To be hanged by the neck till he was dead .
Parsing [sent. 8984 len. 32]: As it came on very dark , he began to think of all the men he had known who had died upon the scaffold ; some of them through his means .
Parsing [sent. 8985 len. 16]: They rose up , in such quick succession , that he could hardly count them .
Parsing [sent. 8986 len. 23]: He had seen some of them die , -- and had joked too , because they died with prayers upon their lips .
Parsing [sent. 8987 len. 27]: With what a rattling noise the drop went down ; and how suddenly they changed , from strong and vigorous men to dangling heaps of clothes !
Parsing [sent. 8988 len. 16]: Some of them might have inhabited that very cell -- sat upon that very spot .
Parsing [sent. 8989 len. 13]: It was very dark ; why did n't they bring a light ?
Parsing [sent. 8990 len. 9]: The cell had been built for many years .
Parsing [sent. 8991 len. 11]: Scores of men must have passed their last hours there .
Parsing [sent. 8992 len. 34]: It was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodies -- the cap , the noose , the pinioned arms , the faces that he knew , even beneath that hideous veil .
Parsing [sent. 8993 len. 5]: -- Light , light !
Parsing [sent. 8994 len. 62]: At length , when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door and walls , two men appeared : one bearing a candle , which he thrust into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall : the other dragging in a mattress on which to pass the night ; for the prisoner was to be left alone no more .
Parsing [sent. 8995 len. 12]: Then came the night -- dark , dismal , silent night .
Parsing [sent. 8996 len. 19]: Other watchers are glad to hear this church-clock strike , for they tell of life and coming day .
Parsing [sent. 8997 len. 6]: To him they brought despair .
Parsing [sent. 8998 len. 19]: The boom of every iron bell came laden with the one , deep , hollow sound -- Death .
Parsing [sent. 8999 len. 18]: What availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning , which penetrated even there , to him ?
Parsing [sent. 9000 len. 14]: It was another form of knell , with mockery added to the warning .
Parsing [sent. 9001 len. 5]: The day passed off .
Parsing [sent. 9002 len. 2]: Day ?
Parsing [sent. 9003 len. 41]: There was no day ; it was gone as soon as come -- and night came on again ; night so long , and yet so short ; long in its dreadful silence , and short in its fleeting hours .
Parsing [sent. 9004 len. 17]: At one time he raved and blasphemed ; and at another howled and tore his hair .
Parsing [sent. 9005 len. 22]: Venerable men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him , but he had driven them away with curses .
Parsing [sent. 9006 len. 12]: They renewed their charitable efforts , and he beat them off .
Parsing [sent. 9007 len. 3]: Saturday night .
Parsing [sent. 9008 len. 9]: He had only one night more to live .
Parsing [sent. 9009 len. 13]: And as he thought of this , the day broke -- Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 9010 len. 65]: It was not until the night of this last awful day , that a withering sense of his helpless , desperate state came in its full intensity upon his blighted soul ; not that he had ever held any defined or positive hope of mercy , but that he had never been able to consider more than the dim probability of dying so soon .
Parsing [sent. 9011 len. 36]: He had spoken little to either of the two men , who relieved each other in their attendance upon him ; and they , for their parts , made no effort to rouse his attention .
Parsing [sent. 9012 len. 10]: He had sat there , awake , but dreaming .
Parsing [sent. 9013 len. 45]: Now , he started up , every minute , and with gasping mouth and burning skin , hurried to and fro , in such a paroxysm of fear and wrath that even they -- used to such sights -- recoiled from him with horror .
Parsing [sent. 9014 len. 39]: He grew so terrible , at last , in all the tortures of his evil conscience , that one man could not bear to sit there , eyeing him alone ; and so the two kept watch together .
Parsing [sent. 9015 len. 14]: He cowered down upon his stone bed , and thought of the past .
Parsing [sent. 9016 len. 27]: He had been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his capture , and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth .
Parsing [sent. 9017 len. 40]: His red hair hung down upon his bloodless face ; his beard was torn , and twisted into knots ; his eyes shone with a terrible light ; his unwashed flesh crackled with the fever that burnt him up .
Parsing [sent. 9018 len. 6]: Eight -- nine -- then .
Parsing [sent. 9019 len. 34]: If it was not a trick to frighten him , and those were the real hours treading on each other 's heels , where would he be , when they came round again !
Parsing [sent. 9020 len. 2]: Eleven !
Parsing [sent. 9021 len. 15]: Another struck , before the voice of the previous hour had ceased to vibrate .
Parsing [sent. 9022 len. 66]: At eight , he would be the only mourner in his own funeral train ; at eleven -- Those dreadful walls of Newgate , which have hidden so much misery and such unspeakable anguish , not only from the eyes , but , too often , and too long , from the thoughts , of men , never held so dread a spectacle as that .
Parsing [sent. 9023 len. 37]: The few who lingered as they passed , and wondered what the man was doing who was to be hanged to-morrow , would have slept but ill that night , if they could have seen him .
Parsing [sent. 9024 len. 35]: From early in the evening until nearly midnight , little groups of two and three presented themselves at the lodge-gate , and inquired , with anxious faces , whether any reprieve had been received .
Parsing [sent. 9025 len. 57]: These being answered in the negative , communicated the welcome intelligence to clusters in the street , who pointed out to one another the door from which he must come out , and showed where the scaffold would be built , and , walking with unwilling steps away , turned back to conjure up the scene .
Parsing [sent. 9026 len. 31]: By degrees they fell off , one by one ; and , for an hour , in the dead of night , the street was left to solitude and darkness .
Parsing [sent. 9027 len. 60]: The space before the prison was cleared , and a few strong barriers , painted black , had been already thrown across the road to break the pressure of the expected crowd , when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver appeared at the wicket , and presented an order of admission to the prisoner , signed by one of the sheriffs .
Parsing [sent. 9028 len. 8]: They were immediately admitted into the lodge .
Parsing [sent. 9029 len. 12]: ` Is the young gentleman to come too , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 9030 len. 11]: said the man whose duty it was to conduct them .
Parsing [sent. 9031 len. 12]: ` It 's not a sight for children , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 9032 len. 68]: ` It is not indeed , my friend , ' rejoined Mr. Brownlow ; ` but my business with this man is intimately connected with him ; and as this child has seen him in the full career of his success and villainy , I think it as well -- even at the cost of some pain and fear -- that he should see him now . '
Parsing [sent. 9033 len. 16]: These few words had been said apart , so as to be inaudible to Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 9034 len. 42]: The man touched his hat ; and glancing at Oliver with some curiousity , opened another gate , opposite to that by which they had entered , and led them on , through dark and winding ways , towards the cells .
Parsing [sent. 9035 len. 35]: ` This , ' said the man , stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of workmen were making some preparations in profound silence -- ` this is the place he passes through .
Parsing [sent. 9036 len. 17]: If you step this way , you can see the door he goes out at . '
Parsing [sent. 9037 len. 23]: He led them into a stone kitchen , fitted with coppers for dressing the prison food , and pointed to a door .
Parsing [sent. 9038 len. 32]: There was an open grating above it , throught which came the sound of men 's voices , mingled with the noise of hammering , and the throwing down of boards .
Parsing [sent. 9039 len. 7]: There were putting up the scaffold .
Parsing [sent. 9040 len. 51]: From this place , they passed through several strong gates , opened by other turnkeys from the inner side ; and , having entered an open yard , ascended a flight of narrow steps , and came into a passage with a row of strong doors on the left hand .
Parsing [sent. 9041 len. 21]: Motioning them to remain where they were , the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys .
Parsing [sent. 9042 len. 37]: The two attendants , after a little whispering , came out into the passage , stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief , and motioned the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell .
Parsing [sent. 9043 len. 4]: They did so .
Parsing [sent. 9044 len. 33]: The condemned criminal was seated on his bed , rocking himself from side to side , with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the face of a man .
Parsing [sent. 9045 len. 31]: His mind was evidently wandering to his old life , for he continued to mutter , without appearing conscious of their presence otherwise than as a part of his vision .
Parsing [sent. 9046 len. 13]: ` Good boy , Charley -- well done -- ' he mumbled .
Parsing [sent. 9047 len. 7]: ` Oliver , too , ha !
Parsing [sent. 9048 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 9049 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 9050 len. 19]: Oliver too -- quite the gentleman now -- quite the -- take that boy away to bed ! '
Parsing [sent. 9051 len. 23]: The jailer took the disengaged hand of Oliver ; and , whispering him not to be alarmed , looked on without speaking .
Parsing [sent. 9052 len. 8]: ` Take him away to bed ! '
Parsing [sent. 9053 len. 3]: cried Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 9054 len. 10]: ` Do you hear me , some of you ?
Parsing [sent. 9055 len. 14]: He has been the -- the -- somehow the cause of all this .
Parsing [sent. 9056 len. 33]: It 's worth the money to bring him up to it -- Bolter 's throat , Bill ; never mind the girl -- Bolter 's throat as deep as you can cut .
Parsing [sent. 9057 len. 6]: Saw his head off ! '
Parsing [sent. 9058 len. 8]: ` Fagin , ' said the jailer .
Parsing [sent. 9059 len. 6]: ` That 's me ! '
Parsing [sent. 9060 len. 19]: cried the Jew , falling instantly , into the attitude of listening he had assumed upon his trial .
Parsing [sent. 9061 len. 16]: ` An old man , my Lord ; a very old , old man ! '
Parsing [sent. 9062 len. 19]: ` Here , ' said the turnkey , laying his hand upon his breast to keep him down .
Parsing [sent. 9063 len. 18]: ` Here 's somebody wants to see you , to ask you some questions , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 9064 len. 4]: Fagin , Fagin !
Parsing [sent. 9065 len. 7]: Are you a man ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9066 len. 25]: I sha n't be one long , ' he replied , looking up with a face retaining no human expression but rage and terror .
Parsing [sent. 9067 len. 6]: ` Strike them all dead !
Parsing [sent. 9068 len. 9]: What right have they to butcher me ? '
Parsing [sent. 9069 len. 12]: As he spoke he caught sight of Oliver and Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 9070 len. 18]: Shrinking to the furthest corner of the seat , he demanded to know what they wanted there .
Parsing [sent. 9071 len. 13]: ` Steady , ' said the turnkey , still holding him down .
Parsing [sent. 9072 len. 11]: ` Now , sir , tell him what you want .
Parsing [sent. 9073 len. 17]: Quick , if you please , for he grows worse as the time gets on . '
Parsing [sent. 9074 len. 31]: ` You have some papers , ' said Mr. Brownlow advancing , ` which were placed in your hands , for better security , by a man called Monks . '
Parsing [sent. 9075 len. 13]: ` It 's all a lie together , ' replied Fagin . '
Parsing [sent. 9076 len. 9]: I have n't one -- not one . '
Parsing [sent. 9077 len. 34]: ` For the love of God , ' said Mr. Brownlow solemnly , ` do not say that now , upon the very verge of death ; but tell me where they are .
Parsing [sent. 9078 len. 22]: You know that Sikes is dead ; that Monks has confessed ; that there is no hope of any further gain .
Parsing [sent. 9079 len. 6]: Where are those papers ? '
Parsing [sent. 9080 len. 11]: ` Oliver , ' cried Fagin , beckoning to him .
Parsing [sent. 9081 len. 5]: ` Here , here !
Parsing [sent. 9082 len. 8]: Let me whisper to you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9083 len. 21]: I am not afraid , ' said Oliver in a low voice , as he relinquished Mr. Brownlow 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 9084 len. 34]: ` The papers , ' said Fagin , drawing Oliver towards him , ` are in a canvas bag , in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top front-room .
Parsing [sent. 9085 len. 10]: I want to talk to you , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 9086 len. 8]: I want to talk to you . '
Parsing [sent. 9087 len. 9]: ` Yes , yes , ' returned Oliver .
Parsing [sent. 9088 len. 7]: ` Let me say a prayer .
Parsing [sent. 9089 len. 2]: Do !
Parsing [sent. 9090 len. 6]: Let me say one prayer .
Parsing [sent. 9091 len. 19]: Say only one , upon your knees , with me , and we will talk till morning . '
Parsing [sent. 9092 len. 25]: ` Outside , outside , ' replied Fagin , pushing the boy before him towards the door , and looking vacantly over his head .
Parsing [sent. 9093 len. 13]: ` Say I 've gone to sleep -- they 'll believe you .
Parsing [sent. 9094 len. 12]: You can get me out , if you take me so .
Parsing [sent. 9095 len. 7]: Now then , now then ! '
Parsing [sent. 9096 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9097 len. 7]: God forgive this wretched man ! '
Parsing [sent. 9098 len. 9]: cried the boy with a burst of tears .
Parsing [sent. 9099 len. 13]: ` That 's right , that 's right , ' said Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 9100 len. 7]: ` That 'll help us on .
Parsing [sent. 9101 len. 4]: This door first .
Parsing [sent. 9102 len. 21]: If I shake and tremble , as we pass the gallows , do n't you mind , but hurry on .
Parsing [sent. 9103 len. 7]: Now , now , now ! '
Parsing [sent. 9104 len. 12]: ` Have you nothing else to ask him , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 9105 len. 4]: inquired the turnkey .
Parsing [sent. 9106 len. 10]: ` No other question , ' replied Mr. Brownlow .
Parsing [sent. 9107 len. 33]: ` If I hoped we could recall him to a sense of his position -- ' ` Nothing will do that , sir , ' replied the man , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 9108 len. 8]: ` You had better leave him . '
Parsing [sent. 9109 len. 12]: The door of the cell opened , and the attendants returned .
Parsing [sent. 9110 len. 11]: ` Press on , press on , ' cried Fagin .
Parsing [sent. 9111 len. 8]: ` Softly , but not so slow .
Parsing [sent. 9112 len. 5]: Faster , faster ! '
Parsing [sent. 9113 len. 18]: The men laid hands upon him , and disengaging Oliver from his grasp , held him back .
Parsing [sent. 9114 len. 38]: He struggled with the power of desperation , for an instant ; and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those massive walls , and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard .
Parsing [sent. 9115 len. 10]: It was some time before they left the prison .
Parsing [sent. 9116 len. 27]: Oliver nearly swooned after this frightful scene , and was so weak that for an hour or more , he had not the strength to walk .
Parsing [sent. 9117 len. 8]: Day was dawning when they again emerged .
Parsing [sent. 9118 len. 32]: A great multitude had already assembled ; the windows were filled with people , smoking and playing cards to beguile the time ; the crowd were pushing , quarrelling , joking .
Parsing [sent. 9119 len. 37]: Everything told of life and animation , but one dark cluster of objects in the centre of all -- the black stage , the cross-beam , the rope , and all the hideous apparatus of death .
Parsing [sent. 9120 len. 18]: CHAPTER LIII AND LAST The fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed .
Parsing [sent. 9121 len. 18]: The little that remains to their historian to relate , is told in few and simple words .
Parsing [sent. 9122 len. 46]: Before three months had passed , Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie were married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of the young clergyman 's labours ; on the same day they entered into possession of their new and happy home .
Parsing [sent. 9123 len. 58]: Mrs. Maylie took up her abode with her son and daughter-in-law , to enjoy , during the tranquil remainder of her days , the greatest felicity that age and worth can know -- the contemplation of the happiness of those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a well-spent life , have been unceasingly bestowed .
Parsing [sent. 9124 len. 59]: It appeared , on full and careful investigation , that if the wreck of property remaining in the custody of Monks -LRB- which had never prospered either in his hands or in those of his mother -RRB- were equally divided between himself and Oliver , it would yield , to each , little more than three thousand pounds .
Parsing [sent. 9125 len. 56]: By the provisions of his father 's will , Oliver would have been entitled to the whole ; but Mr. Brownlow , unwilling to deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices and pursuing an honest career , proposed this mode of distribution , to which his young charge joyfully acceded .
Parsing [sent. 9126 len. 69]: Monks , still bearing that assumed name , retired with his portion to a distant part of the New World ; where , having quickly squandered it , he once more fell into his old courses , and , after undergoing a long confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery , at length sunk under an attack of his old disorder , and died in prison .
Parsing [sent. 9127 len. 17]: As far from home , died the chief remaining members of his friend Fagin 's gang .
Parsing [sent. 9128 len. 8]: Mr. Brownlow adopted Oliver as his son .
Parsing [sent. 9129 len. 63]: Removing with him and the old housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage-house , where his dear friends resided , he gratified the only remaining wish of Oliver 's warm and earnest heart , and thus linked together a little society , whose condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever be known in this changing world .
Parsing [sent. 9130 len. 54]: Soon after the marriage of the young people , the worthy doctor returned to Chertsey , where , bereft of the presence of his old friends , he would have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a feeling ; and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how .
Parsing [sent. 9131 len. 69]: For two or three months , he contented himself with hinting that he feared the air began to disagree with him ; then , finding that the place really no longer was , to him , what it had been , he settled his business on his assistant , took a bachelor 's cottage outside the village of which his young friend was pastor , and instantaneously recovered .
Parsing [sent. 9132 len. 28]: Here he took to gardening , planting , fishing , carpentering , and various other pursuits of a similar kind : all undertaken with his characteristic impetuosity .
Parsing [sent. 9133 len. 19]: In each and all he has since become famous throughout the neighborhood , as a most profound authority .
Parsing [sent. 9134 len. 23]: Before his removal , he had managed to contract a strong friendship for Mr. Grimwig , which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated .
Parsing [sent. 9135 len. 18]: He is accordingly visited by Mr. Grimwig a great many times in the course of the year .
Parsing [sent. 9136 len. 44]: On all such occasions , Mr. Grimwig plants , fishes , and carpenters , with great ardour ; doing everything in a very singular and unprecedented manner , but always maintaining with his favourite asseveration , that his mode is the right one .
Parsing [sent. 9137 len. 45]: On Sundays , he never fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergyman 's face : always informing Mr. Losberne , in strict confidence afterwards , that he considers it an excellent performance , but deems it as well not to say so .
Parsing [sent. 9138 len. 87]: It is a standing and very favourite joke , for Mr. Brownlow to rally him on his old prophecy concerning Oliver , and to remind him of the night on which they sat with the watch between them , waiting his return ; but Mr. Grimwig contends that he was right in the main , and , in proof thereof , remarks that Oliver did not come back after all ; which always calls forth a laugh on his side , and increases his good humour .
Parsing [sent. 9139 len. 59]: Mr. Noah Claypole : receiving a free pardon from the Crown in consequence of being admitted approver against Fagin : and considering his profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish : was , for some little time , at a loss for the means of a livelihood , not burdened with too much work .
Parsing [sent. 9140 len. 21]: After some consideration , he went into business as an Informer , in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence .
Parsing [sent. 9141 len. 20]: His plan is , to walk out once a week during church time attended by Charlotte in respectable attire .
Parsing [sent. 9142 len. 37]: The lady faints away at the doors of charitable publicans , and the gentleman being accommodated with three-penny worth of brandy to restore her , lays an information next day , and pockets half the penalty .
Parsing [sent. 9143 len. 13]: Sometimes Mr. Claypole faints himself , but the result is the same .
Parsing [sent. 9144 len. 38]: Mr. and Mrs. Bumble , deprived of their situations , were gradually reduced to great indigence and misery , and finally became paupers in that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others .
Parsing [sent. 9145 len. 30]: Mr. Bumble has been heard to say , that in this reverse and degradation , he has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his wife .
Parsing [sent. 9146 len. 28]: As to Mr. Giles and Brittles , they still remain in their old posts , although the former is bald , and the last-named boy quite grey .
Parsing [sent. 9147 len. 45]: They sleep at the parsonage , but divide their attentions so equally among its inmates , and Oliver and Mr. Brownlow , and Mr. Losberne , that to this day the villagers have never been able to discover to which establishment they properly belong .
Parsing [sent. 9148 len. 29]: Master Charles Bates , appalled by Sikes 's crime , fell into a train of reflection whether an honest life was not , after all , the best .
