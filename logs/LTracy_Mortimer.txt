Parsing [sent. 1 len. 30]: THE STRANGE CASE OF MORTIMER FENLEY BY LOUIS TRACY THE STRANGE CASE OF MORTIMER FENLEY CHAPTER I THE WATER NYMPHS Does an evil deed cast a shadow in advance ?
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 38]: Does premeditated crime spread a baleful aura which affects certain highly-strung temperaments just as the sensation of a wave of cold air rising from the spine to the head may be a forewarning of epilepsy or hysteria ?
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 73]: John Trenholme had cause to think so one bright June morning in 1912 , and he has never ceased to believe it , though the events which made him an outstanding figure in the `` Strange Case of Mortimer Fenley , '' as the murder of a prominent man in the City of London came to be known , have long since been swept into oblivion by nearly five years of war .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 13]: Even the sun became a prime agent of the occult that morning .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 37]: It found a chink in a blind and threw a bar of vivid light across the face of a young man lying asleep in the front bedroom of the `` White Horse Inn '' at Roxton .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 40]: It crept onward from a firm , well-molded chin to lips now tight set , though not lacking signs that they would open readily in a smile and perhaps reveal two rows of strong , white , even teeth .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 25]: Indeed , when that strip of sunshine touched and warmed them , the smile came ; so the sleeper was dreaming , and pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 14]: But the earth stays not for men , no matter what their dreams .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 17]: In a few minutes the radiant line reached the sleeper 's eyes , and he awoke .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 33]: Naturally , he stared straight at the disturber of his slumbers ; and being a mere man , who emulated not the ways of eagles , was routed at the first glance .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 34]: More than that , he was thoroughly aroused , and sprang out of bed with a celerity that would have given many another young man a headache during the remainder of the day .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 61]: But John Trenholme , artist by profession , was somewhat of a light-hearted vagabond by instinct ; if the artist was ready to be annoyed because of an imaginary loss of precious daylight , the vagabond laughed cheerily when he blinked at a clock and learned that the hour still lacked some minutes of half past five in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 19]: `` By gad , '' he grinned , pulling up the blind , `` I was scared stiff .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 34]: I thought the blessed alarm had missed fire , and that I had been lying here like a hog during the best part of the finest day England has seen this year . ''
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 62]: Evidently he was still young enough to deal in superlatives , for there had been other fine days that Summer ; moreover , in likening himself to a pig , he was ridiculously unfair to six feet of athletic symmetry in which it would be difficult to detect any marked resemblance to the animal whose name is a synonym for laziness .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 31]: On the way to the bathroom he stopped to listen for sounds of an aroused household , but the inmates of the White Horse Inn were still taking life easily .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 16]: `` Eliza vows she can hear that alarm in her room , '' he communed .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 30]: `` Well , suppose we assist nature , always a laudable thing in itself , and peculiarly excellent when breakfast is thereby advanced a quarter of an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 20]: Eliza was the inn 's stout and voluble cook-housekeeper , and her attic lay directly above Trenholme 's room .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 30]: He went back for the clock , crept swiftly upstairs , opened a door a few inches , and put the infernal machine inside , close to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 31]: He was splashing in the bath when a harsh and penetrating din jarred through the house , and a slight scream showed that Eliza had been duly `` alarmed . ''
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 13]: A few minutes later came a heavy thump on the bathroom door .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 8]: `` All right , Mr. Trenholme ! ''
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 6]: cried an irate female voice .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 12]: `` You 've been up to your tricks , have you ?
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 20]: It 'll be my turn when I make your coffee ; I 'll pepper an ' salt it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 11]: `` Why , what 's the matter , Eliza ? ''
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 3]: `` Matter !
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 7]: Frightenin ' a body like that !
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 17]: I thought a lot o ' suffrigettes were smashin ' the windows of the snug . ''
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 13]: Eliza was still touchy when Trenholme ventured to peep into the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 17]: `` I do n't know how you dare show your face , '' she cried wrathfully .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 7]: `` The impidence of men nowadays !
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 13]: Just fancy you comin ' an ' openin ' my door ! ''
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 13]: `` But , _ ch√©rie _ , what have I done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 10]: he inquired , his brown eyes wide with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 13]: `` I 'm not your cherry , nor your peach , neither .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 9]: Who put that clock in my room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 10]: `` What clock , _ ma belle _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 25]: Eliza picked up an egg , and bent so fiery a glance on the intruder that he dodged out of sight for a second .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 20]: `` Listen , _ carissima _ , '' he pleaded , peering round the jamb of the door again .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 17]: `` If the alarm found its way upstairs I must have been walking in my sleep .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 15]: While you were dreaming of suffragettes I may have been dreaming of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 30]: `` Stop there a bit longer , chatterin ' and callin ' me names , an ' your bacon will be frizzled to a cinder , '' she retorted .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 18]: `` But I really hoped to save you some trouble by carrying in the breakfast tray myself .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 20]: I hate to see a jolly , good-tempered woman of your splendid physique working yourself to a shadow . ''
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 21]: * * * * * Eliza squared her elbows as a preliminary to another outburst , when the stairs creaked .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 15]: Mary , the `` help , '' was arriving hurriedly , in curl papers .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 16]: `` Oh , _ you _ 've condescended to get up , have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 6]: was the greeting Mary received .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 14]: `` Why , it 's on ' y ten minutes to six ! ''
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 17]: cried the astonished girl , gazing at a grandfather 's clock as if it were bewitched .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 20]: `` You 've never had such a shock since you were born , '' went on the sarcastic Eliza .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 12]: `` But do n't thank _ me _ , my girl .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 16]: Thank Mr. Trenholme , the gentleman stannin ' there grinnin ' like a Cheshire cat .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 32]: Talk to him nicely , an ' p ` raps he 'll paint your picter , an ' then your special butcher boy will see how beautiful you reelly are . ''
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 29]: `` Jim do n't need tellin ' anything about that , '' said the girl , smiling , for Eliza 's bark was notoriously worse than her bite .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 4]: `` Jim ! ''
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 5]: came the snorting comment .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 57]: `` The first man who ever axed me to marry him was called Jim , an ' when , like a wise woman , I said ` No , ' he went away an ' ` listed in the Royal Artillery an ' lost his leg in a war -- that 's what Jim did . ''
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 13]: `` What a piece of luck you did n't accept him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 4]: put on Trenholme .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 12]: `` An ' why , I 'd like to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 11]: `` Because he began by losing his head over you .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 20]: If a leg was missing , too , there was n't much of Jim left , was there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 17]: Mary giggled , and Eliza seized the egg again ; so Trenholme ran to his sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 39]: Within half an hour he was passing through the High Street , bidding an affable `` Good morning '' to such early risers as he met , and evidently well content with himself and the world in general .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 35]: His artist 's kit revealed his profession even to the uncritical eye , but no student of men could have failed to guess his bent were he habited in the garb of a costermonger .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 25]: The painter and the poet are the last of the Bohemians , and John Trenholme was a Bohemian to the tips of his fingers .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 18]: He carried himself like a cavalier , but the divine flame of art kindled in his eye .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 22]: He had learned how to paint in Julien 's studio , and that same school had taught him to despise convention .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 28]: He looked on nature as a series of exquisite pictures , and regarded men and women in the mass as creatures that occasionally fitted into the landscape .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 8]: He was heart whole and fancy free .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 49]: At twenty-five he had already exhibited three times in the Salon , and was spoken of by the critics as a painter of much promise , which is the critical method of waiting to see how the cat jumps when an artist of genius and originality arrests attention .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 24]: He had peculiarly luminous brown eyes set well apart in a face which won the prompt confidence of women , children and dogs .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 44]: He was splendidly built for an out-door life , and moved with a long , supple stride , a gait which people mistook for lounging until they walked with him , and found that the pace was something over four miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 46]: Add to these personal traits the fact that he had dwelt in Roxton exactly two days and a half , and was already on speaking terms with most of the inhabitants , and you have a fair notion of John Trenholme 's appearance and ways .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 47]: There remains but to add that he was commissioned by a magazine to visit this old-world Hertfordshire village and depict some of its beauties before a projected railway introduced the jerry-builder and a sewerage scheme , and his presence in the White Horse Inn is explained .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 79]: He had sketched the straggling High Street , the green , the inn itself , boasting a license six hundred years old , the undulating common , the church with its lych gate , the ivy-clad ruin known as `` The Castle , '' with its square Norman keep still frowning at an English countryside , and there was left only an Elizabethan mansion , curiously misnamed `` The Towers , '' to be transferred to his portfolio .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 10]: Here , oddly enough , he had been rebuffed .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 32]: A note to the owner , Mortimer Fenley , banker and super City man , asking permission to enter the park of an afternoon , had met with a curt refusal .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 104]: Trenholme , of course , was surprised , since he was paying the man a rare compliment ; he had expressed in the inn his full and free opinion concerning all money grubbers , and the Fenley species thereof in particular ; whereupon the stout Eliza , who classed the Fenley family as `` rubbish , '' informed him that there was a right of way through the park , and that from a certain point near a lake he could sketch the grand old manor house to his heart 's content , let the Fenleys and their keepers scowl as they chose .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 12]: The village barber , too , bore out Eliza 's statement .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 32]: `` A rare old row there was in Roxton twenty year ago , when Fenley fust kem here , an ' tried to close the path , '' said the barber .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 16]: `` But we beat him , we did , an ' well he knows it .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 83]: Not many folk use it nowadays , ` coss the artful ole dodger opened a new road to the station ; but some of us makes a point of strollin ' that way on a Sunday afternoon , just to look at the pheasants an ' rabbits , an ' it 's a treat to see the head keeper 's face when we go through the lodge gates at the Easton end , for that is the line the path takes . ''
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 50]: Here followed a detailed description , for the Roxton barber , like every other barber , could chatter like a magpie ; it was in this wise that Trenholme was able to defy the laws forbidding trespass , and score off the seemingly uncivil owner of a historical dwelling .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 20]: He little imagined , that glorious June morning , that he was entering on a road of strange adventure .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 8]: He had chosen an early hour purposely .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 30]: Not only were the lights and shadows perfect for water color , but it was highly probable that he would be able to come and go without attracting attention .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 16]: He had no wish to annoy Fenley , or quarrel with the man 's myrmidons .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 27]: Indeed , he would not have visited the estate at all if the magazine editor had not specially stipulated for a full-page drawing of the house .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 23]: Now , all would have been well had the barber 's directions proved as bald in spirit as they were in letter .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 29]: `` After passin ' ` The Waggoner 's Rest , ' you 'll come to a pair of iron gates on the right , '' he had said .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 10]: `` On one side there 's a swing gate .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 19]: Go through , an ' make straight for a clump of cedars on top of a little hill .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 14]: There may n't be much of a path , but that 's it .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 16]: It 's reelly a short cut to the Easton gate on the London road . ''
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 18]: Yet who could guess what a snare for an artist 's feet lay in those few words ?
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 32]: How could Trenholme realize that `` a pair of iron gates '' would prove to be an almost perfect example of Christopher Wren 's genius as a designer of wrought iron ?
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 26]: Trenholme 's eyes sparkled when he beheld this prize , with its acanthus leaves and roses beaten out with wonderful freedom and beauty of curve .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 7]: A careful drawing was the result .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 23]: Another result , uncounted by him , but of singular importance in its outcome was the delay of forty minutes thus entailed .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 27]: He crossed an undulating park , and had no difficulty in tracing an almost disused path in certain grass-grown furrows leading past the group of cedars .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 39]: On reaching this point he obtained a fair view of the mansion ; but the sun was directly behind him , as the house faced southeast , and he decided to encroach some few yards on private property .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 25]: A brier-laden slope fell from the other side of the trees to a delightful-looking lake fed by a tiny cascade on the east side .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 7]: An ideal spot , he thought .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 39]: This , then , was the stage setting : Trenholme , screened by black cedars and luxuriant brushwood , was seated about fifty feet above the level of the lake and some forty yards from its nearest sedges .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 27]: The lake itself , largely artificial , lay at the foot of the waterfall , which gurgled and splashed down a miniature precipice of moss-covered bowlders .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 30]: Here and there a rock , a copper beech , a silver larch , or a few flowering shrubs cast strong shadows on the dark , pellucid mirror beneath .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 35]: On a cunningly contrived promontory of brown rock stood a white marble statue of Venus Aphrodite , and the ripples from the cascade seemed to endow with life the shimmering reflection of the goddess .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 33]: Beyond the lake a smooth lawn , dotted with fine old oaks and chestnuts , rose gently for a quarter of a mile to the Italian gardens in front of the house .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 11]: To the left , the park was bounded by woods .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 17]: To the right was another wood , partly concealing a series of ravines and disused quarries .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 48]: Altogether a charming setting for an Elizabethan manor , pastoral , peaceful , quite English , and seeming on that placid June morning so remote from the crowded mart that it was hard to believe the nearest milestone , with its `` London , 30 miles . ''
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 29]: Had Trenholme glanced at his watch he would have discovered that the hour was now half past seven , or nearly an hour later than he had planned .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 16]: But Art , which is long-lived , recks little of Time , an evanescent thing .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 7]: He was enthusiastic over his subject .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 10]: He would make not one sketch , but two .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 12]: That lake , like the gates , was worthy of immortality .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 9]: Of course , the house must come first .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 11]: He unpacked a canvas hold-all , and soon was busy .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 12]: He worked with the speed and assured confidence of a master .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 19]: By years of patient industry he had wrested from Nature the secrets of her tints and tone values .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 25]: Quickly there grew into being an exquisitely bright and well balanced drawing , impressionist , but true ; a harmony of color and atmosphere .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 16]: Leaving subtleties to the quiet thought of the studio , he turned to the lake .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 8]: Here the lights and shadows were bolder .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 11]: They demanded the accurate appraisement of the half closed eye .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 57]: He was so absorbed in his task that he was blithely unconscious of the approach of a girl from the house , and his first glimpse of her was forthcoming when she crossed the last spread of velvet sward which separated a cluster of rhododendrons in the middle distance from the farther edge of the lake .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 13]: It was not altogether surprising that he had not seen her earlier .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 27]: She wore a green coat and skirt and a most curiously shaped hat of the same hue , so that her colors blended with the landscape .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 22]: Moreover , she was walking rapidly , and had covered the intervening quarter of a mile in four minutes or less .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 28]: He thought at first that she was heading straight for his lofty perch , and was perhaps bent on questioning his right to be there at all .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 6]: But he was promptly undeceived .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 17]: Her mind was set on one object , and her eyes did not travel beyond it .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 34]: She no more suspected that an artist was lurking in the shade of the cedars than she did that the man in the moon was gazing blandly at her above their close-packed foliage .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 55]: She came on with rapid , graceful strides , stood for a moment by the side of the Venus , and then , while Trenholme literally gasped for breath , shed coat , skirt and shoes , revealing a slim form clad in a dark blue bathing costume , and dived into the lake .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 7]: Trenholme had never felt more surprised .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 36]: The change of costume was so unexpected , the girl 's complete ignorance of his presence so obvious , that he regarded himself as a confessed intruder , somewhat akin to Peeping Tom of Coventry .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 10]: He was utterly at a loss how to act .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 22]: If he stood up and essayed a hurried retreat , the girl might be frightened , and would unquestionably be annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 8]: It was impossible to creep away unseen .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 38]: He was well below the crest of the slope crowned by the trees , and the nymph now disporting in the lake could hardly fail to discover him , no matter how deftly he crouched and twisted .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 9]: At this crisis , the artistic instinct triumphed .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 38]: He became aware that the one element lacking hitherto , the element that lent magic to the beauty of the lake and its vivid environment of color , was the touch of life brought by the swimmer .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 41]: He caught the flash of her limbs as they moved rhythmically through the dark , clear water , and it seemed almost as if the gods had striven to be kind in sending this naiad to complete a perfect setting .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 10]: With stealthy hands he drew forth a small canvas .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 16]: Oil , not mild water color , was the fitting medium to portray this Eden .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 31]: Shrinking back under cover of a leafy brier , he began a third sketch in which the dominant note was the contrast between the living woman and the marble Venus .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 11]: For fifteen minutes the girl disported herself like a dolphin .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 19]: Evidently she was a practiced swimmer , and had at her command all the resources of the art .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 17]: At last she climbed out , and stood dripping on the sun-laved rock beside the statue .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 20]: Trenholme had foreseen this attitude -- had , in fact , painted with feverish energy in anticipation of it .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 12]: The comparison was too striking to be missed by an artist .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 33]: Were it not for the tightly clinging garments , the pair would have provided a charming representation of Galatea in stone and Galatea after Pygmalion 's frenzy had warmed her into life .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 14]: Trenholme was absolutely deaf now to any consideration save that of artistic endeavor .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 22]: With a swift accuracy that was nearly marvelous he put on the canvas the sheen of faultless limbs and slender neck .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 76]: He even secured the spun-gold glint of hair tightly coifed under a bathing cap -- a species of head-dress which had puzzled him at the first glance -- and there was more than a suggestion of a veritable portrait of the regular , lively and delicately beautiful features which belonged to a type differing in every essential from the cold , classic loveliness of the statue , yet vastly more appealing in its sheer femininity .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 6]: Then the spell was broken .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 30]: The girl slipped on her shoes , dressed herself in a few seconds , and was hurrying back to the house , almost before Trenholme dared to breathe normally .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 29]: `` Well , '' he muttered , watching the swaying of the green skirt as its owner traversed the park , `` this is something like an adventure !
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 10]: By Jove , I 've been lucky this morning !
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 12]: I 've got my picture for next year 's Salon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 30]: He had got far more , if only he were gifted to peer into the future ; but that is a privilege denied to men , even to artists .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 27]: Soon , when he was calmer , and the embryo sketch had assumed its requisite color notes for subsequent elaboration , he smiled a trifle dubiously .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 29]: `` If that girl 's temperament is as attractive as her looks I 'd throw over the Salon for the sake of meeting her , '' he mused .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 10]: `` But that 's frankly impossible , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 21]: At the best , she would not forgive me if she knew I had watched her in this thievish way .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 8]: I could never explain it , never !
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 6]: She would n't even listen .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 19]: Well , it 's better to have dreamed and lost than never to have dreamed at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 5]: And yet he dreamed .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 36]: His eyes followed the fair unknown while she entered the garden through a gateway of dense yews , and sped lightly up the steps of a terrace adorned with other statues in marble and bronze .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 27]: No doorway broke the pleasing uniformity of the south front , but she disappeared through an open window , swinging herself lightly over the low sill .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 7]: He went with her in imagination .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 70]: Now she was crossing a pretty drawing-room , now running upstairs to her room , now dressing , possibly in white muslin , which , if Trenholme had the choosing of it , would be powdered with tiny _ fleurs de lys _ , now arranging her hair with keen eye for effect , and now tripping down again in obedience to a gong summoning the household to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 3]: He sighed .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 27]: `` If I had the luck of a decent French poodle , this plutocrat Fenley would eke have invited me to lunch , '' he grumbled .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 16]: Then his eyes sought the sketch , and he forgot the girl in her counterfeit .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 11]: By Jove , this _ would _ be a picture !
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 6]: `` The Water Nymphs . ''
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 31]: But he must change the composition a little -- losing none of its character ; only altering its accessories to such an extent that none would recognize the exact setting .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 4]: `` Luck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 9]: he chortled , with mercurial rise of spirits .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 10]: `` I 'm the luckiest dog in England today .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 11]: Happy chance has beaten all the tricks of the studio .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 13]: O ye goddesses , inspire me to heights worthy of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 22]: His visions were rudely dispelled by a gunshot , sharp , insistent , a tocsin of death in that sylvan solitude .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 48]: A host of rooks arose from some tall elms near the house ; a couple of cock pheasants flew with startled chuckling out of the wood on the right ; the white tails of rabbits previously unseen revealed their owners ' whereabouts as they scampered to cover .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 39]: But Trenholme was sportsman enough to realize that the weapon fired was a rifle ; no toy , but of high velocity , and he wondered how any one dared risk its dangerous use in such a locality .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 50]: He fixed the sound definitely as coming from the wood to the right -- the cover quitted so hurriedly by the pheasants -- and instinctively his glance turned to the house , in the half formed thought that some one there might hear the shot , and look out .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 33]: The ground floor window by which the girl had entered still remained open , but now another window , the most easterly one on the first floor , had been raised slightly .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 33]: The light was peculiarly strong and the air so clear that even at the distance he fancied he could distinguish some one gesticulating , or so it seemed , behind the glass .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 9]: This went on for a minute or more .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 6]: Then the window was closed .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 24]: At the same time he noticed a sparkling of glass and brasswork behind the clipped yew hedge which extended beyond the east wing .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 15]: After some puzzling , he made out that a motor car was waiting there .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 4]: That was all .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 8]: The clamor of the rooks soon subsided .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 18]: A couple of rabbits skipped from the bushes to resume an interrupted meal on tender grass shoots .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 10]: A robin trilled a roundelay from some neighboring branch .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 6]: Trenholme looked at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 4]: Half past nine !
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 13]: Why , he must have been mooning there a good half hour !
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 37]: He gathered his traps , and as the result of seeing the automobile , which had not moved yet , determined to forego his earlier project of walking out of the park by the Easton gate .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 14]: He had just emerged from the trees when a gruff voice hailed him .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 4]: `` Hi ! ''
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 3]: it cried .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 15]: `` Who 're you , an ' what are you doin ' here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 18]: A man , carrying a shotgun and accompanied by a dog , strode up with determined air .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 13]: Trenholme explained civilly , since the keeper was clearly within his rights .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 17]: Moreover , the stranger was so patently a gentleman that Velveteens adopted a less imperative tone .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 10]: `` Did you hear a shot fired somewhere ? ''
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 5]: Among those trees . ''
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 4]: And Trenholme pointed .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 19]: `` It was a rifle , too , '' he added , with an eye at the twelve-bore .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 12]: `` So _ I _ thought , '' agreed the keeper .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 17]: `` Rather risky , is n't it , firing bullets in a place like this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 15]: `` I just want to find out who the ijiot is that did it .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 11]: Excuse me , sir , I must be off . ''
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 7]: And man and dog hurried away .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 50]: And Trenholme , not knowing that death had answered the shot , took his own departure , singing as he walked , his thoughts altogether on life , and more especially on life as revealed by the limbs of a girl gleaming in the dark waters of a pool .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 10]: CHAPTER II `` WHO HATH DONE THIS THING ? ''
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 37]: Trenholme 's baritone was strong and tuneful -- for the Muses , if kind , are often lavish of their gifts -- so the final refrain of an impassioned love song traveled far that placid morning .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 19]: Thus , when he reached the iron gates , he found the Roxton policeman standing there , grinning .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 4]: `` Hello ! ''
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 5]: said the artist cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 7]: Of course he knew the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 17]: In a week he would have known every man and dog in the village by name .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 27]: `` Good mornin ' , sir , '' said the Law , which was nibbling its chin strap and had both thumbs stuck in its belt .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 11]: `` That 's a fine thing you was singin ' .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 7]: May I arsk wot it was ?
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 10]: I do a bit in that line meself . ''
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 20]: `` It 's the _ cantabile _ from Saint-Sa√´ns ' _ Samson et Dalila _ , '' replied Trenholme .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 11]: `` Mon coeur s ` ouvre √† ta voix ! ''
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 5]: `` Is it now ?
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 10]: An ' wot may that be , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 7]: The policeman 's humor was infectious .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 5]: Trenholme laughed , too .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 38]: Realizing that the words and accent of Paris had no great vogue in Hertfordshire , he explained , and added that he possessed a copy of the song , which was at the service of the force .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 17]: The man thanked him warmly , and promised to call at the inn during the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 34]: `` By the way , sir , '' he added , when Trenholme had passed through the wicket , `` did you hear a shot fired while you was in the park ? ''
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 6]: `` Jer see anybody ? ''
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 12]: `` A keeper , who seemed rather annoyed about the shooting .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 8]: Some one had fired a rifle . ''
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 24]: `` It sounded like that to me , sir , and it 's an unusual thing at this time of the year . ''
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 24]: `` A heavy-caliber rifle must sound unusual at any time of the year in an enclosed estate near London , '' commented Trenholme .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 10]: `` My idee exactly , '' said the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 9]: `` I think I 'll go that way .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 6]: I may meet Bates . ''
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 47]: `` If Bates is a bandy-legged person with suspicious eyes , a red tie , many pockets , brown leggings , and a yellow dog , you 'll find him searching the wood beyond the lake , which is the direction the shot came from . ''
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 4]: The policeman laughed .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 13]: `` That 's Bates , to a tick , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 20]: `` If he was ` wanted , ' your description would do for the _ Police Gazette _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 3]: They parted .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 57]: Since Trenholme 's subsequent history is bound up more closely with the policeman 's movements during the next hour than with his own unhindered return to the White Horse Inn , it is well to trace the exact course of events as they presented themselves to the ken of a music-loving member of the Hertfordshire constabulary .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 7]: Police Constable Farrow did not hurry .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 4]: Why should he ?
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 40]: A gunshot in a gentleman 's park at half past nine on a June morning might be , as he had put it , `` unusual , '' but it was obviously a matter capable of the simplest explanation .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 35]: Such a sound heard at midnight would be sinister , ominous , replete with those elements of mystery and dread which cause even a policeman 's heart to beat faster than the regulation pace .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 48]: Under the conditions , when he met Bates , he would probably be told that Jenkins , underkeeper and Territorial lance corporal , had resolved to end the vicious career of a hoodie crow , and had not scrupled to reach the wily robber with a bullet .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 21]: So Police Constable Farrow took fifteen minutes to cover the ground which Trenholme 's longer stride had traversed in ten .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 66]: Allow another fifteen for the artist 's packing of his sketching materials , his conversation with gamekeeper and policeman , and the leisurely progress of the latter through the wood , and it will be found that Farrow reached the long straight avenue leading from the lodge at Easton to the main entrance of the house about forty minutes after the firing of the shot .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 21]: He halted on the grass by the side of the well-kept drive , and looked at the waiting motor car .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 6]: The chauffeur was not visible .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 8]: He had seen neither Bates nor Jenkins .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 20]: His passing among the trees had not disturbed even a pheasant , though the estate was alive with game .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 16]: The door of The Towers was open , but no stately manservant was stationed there .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 8]: A yellow dog sat in the sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 27]: Farrow and the dog exchanged long-range glances : the policeman consulted his watch , bit his chin strap , and dug his thumbs into his belt .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 13]: `` Mr. Fenley is late today , '' he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 7]: `` He catches the nine forty-five .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 11]: As a rule , he 's as reliable as Greenwich .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 19]: I 'll wait here till he passes , an ' then call round an ' see Smith . ''
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 38]: Now , Smith was the head gardener ; evidently Police Constable Farrow was not only well acquainted with the various inmates of the mansion , but could have prepared a list of the out-door employees as well .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 57]: He stood there , calm and impassive as Fate , and , without knowing it , represented Fate in her most inexorable mood ; for had he betaken himself elsewhere , the shrewdest brains of Scotland Yard might have been defeated by the enigma they were asked to solve before Mortimer Fenley 's murderer was discovered .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 39]: Indeed , it is reasonable to suppose that if chance had not brought the village constable to that identical spot , and at that very hour , the precise method of the crime might never have been revealed .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 35]: Moreover , Farrow himself may climb slowly to an inspectorship , and pass into the dignified ease of a pension , without being aware of the part he played in a tragedy that morning .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 58]: Of course , in his own estimation , he filled a highly important r√¥le as soon as the hue and cry began , but a great deal of water would flow under London Bridge before the true effect of his walk through the wood and emergence into sight in the avenue began to dawn on other minds .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 8]: His appearance there was a vital fact .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 21]: It changed the trend of circumstances much as the path of a comet is deflected by encountering a heavy planet .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 12]: Presumably , neither comet nor planet is aware of the disturbance .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 11]: That deduction is left to the brooding eye of science .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 37]: Be that as it may , Police Constable Farrow 's serenity was not disturbed until a doctor 's motor car panted along the avenue from Easton and pulled up with a jerk in front of him .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 15]: The doctor , frowning with anxiety , looked out , and recognition was mutual .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 8]: `` Have you got the man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 13]: he asked , and the words were jerked out rather than spoken .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 7]: `` What man , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 5]: inquired Farrows , saluting .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 9]: `` The man who shot Mr. Fenley . ''
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 9]: `` The man who shot Mr. Fenley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 12]: Farrow could only repeat each word in a crescendo of amazement .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 19]: Being a singer , he understood the use of a crescendo , and gave full scope to it .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 5]: `` Good Heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 4]: cried the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 7]: `` Have n't you been told ?
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 5]: Why are you here ?
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 14]: Mr. Fenley was shot dead on his own doorstep nearly an hour ago .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 11]: At least that is the message telephoned by his son .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 5]: Unfortunately I was out .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 6]: Right ahead , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 14]: The chauffeur threw in the clutch , and the car darted on again .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 11]: Farrow followed , a quite alert and horrified policeman now .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 12]: But it was not ordained that he should enter the house .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 19]: He was distant yet a hundred yards , or more , when three men came through the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 26]: They were Bates , the keeper , Tomlinson , the butler , and Mr. Hilton Fenley , elder son of the man now reported dead .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 4]: All were bareheaded .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 23]: The arrival of the doctor , at the instant alighting from his car , prevented them from noticing Farrow 's rapid approach .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 24]: When Hilton Fenley saw the doctor he threw up his hands with the gesture of one who has plumbed the depths of misery .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 14]: Farrow could , and did , fit in the accompanying words quite accurately .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 8]: `` Nothing can be done , Stern !
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 6]: My father is dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 14]: The two clasped each other 's hand , and Hilton Fenley staggered slightly .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 6]: He was overcome with emotion .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 15]: The shock of a terrible crime had taxed his self-control to its uttermost bounds .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 23]: He placed a hand over his eyes and said brokenly to the butler : `` You take Dr. Stern inside , Tomlinson .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 9]: I 'll join you in a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 14]: I must have a breath of air , or I 'll choke ! ''
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 31]: Doctor and butler hurried into the house ; then , but not until then , Hilton Fenley and the keeper became aware of Farrow , now within a few yards .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 33]: At sight of him , Fenley seemed to recover his faculties ; the mere possibility of taking some definite action brought a tinge of color to a pallid and somewhat sallow face .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 9]: Here is the constable , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 15]: `` Go with him , Bates , and have that artist fellow arrested ! ''
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 8]: `` Meaning Mr. Trenholme , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 20]: inquired the policeman , startled anew by this unexpected reference to the man he had parted from so recently .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 32]: `` I do n't know his name ; but Bates met him in the park , near the lake , just after the shot was fired that killed my father . ''
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 10]: `` But I met him , too , sir .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 7]: He did n't fire any shot .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 6]: He had n't a gun .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 17]: In fact , he spoke about the shootin ' , and was surprised at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 21]: `` Look here , Farrow , I am incapable of thinking clearly ; so you must act for the best .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 6]: Some one fired that bullet .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 8]: It nearly tore my father to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 7]: I never saw anything like it .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 8]: It was ghastly -- oh , ghastly !
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 6]: The murderer must be found .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 6]: Why are you losing time ?
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 16]: Jump into the car , and Brodie will take you anywhere you want to go .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 13]: The roads , the railway stations , must be scoured , searched .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 12]: Oh , do something , or I shall go mad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 14]: Hilton Fenley did , indeed , wear the semblance of a man distraught .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 15]: Horror stared from his deep-set eyes and lurked in the corners of his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 47]: His father had been struck dead within a few seconds after they had separated in the entrance hall , both having quitted the breakfast room together , and the awful discovery which followed the cry of an alarmed servant had almost shaken the son 's reason .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 31]: Farrow was hardly fitted to deal with a crisis of such magnitude , but he acted promptly and with fixed purpose -- qualities which form the greater part of generalship .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 26]: `` Bates , '' he said , turning a determined eye on the keeper , `` where was you when you heard the shot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 16]: `` In the kennels , back of the lodge , '' came the instant answer .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 10]: `` And you kem this way at once ? ''
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 3]: `` Straight .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 9]: Did n't lose ` arf a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 16]: `` So no one could have left by the Easton gate without meeting you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 6]: `` That 's right . ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 10]: `` And you found Mr. Trenholme -- where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 13]: `` Comin ' away from the cedars , above the lake . ''
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 7]: `` What did he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 22]: `` Tole me about the shot , an ' pointed out the Quarry Wood as the place it kem from . ''
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 11]: `` Was he upset at all in his manner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 5]: `` Not a bit .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 5]: Spoke quite nateral-like . ''
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 34]: `` Well , between the three of us , you an ' me an ' Mr. Trenholme , we account for both gates an ' the best part of two miles of park .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 5]: Where is Jenkins ? ''
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 9]: `` I left him at the kennels . ''
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 6]: The policeman was momentarily nonplussed .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 23]: He had formed a theory in which Jenkins , that young Territorial spark , figured either as a fool or a criminal .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 16]: `` What 's the use of holding a sort of inquiry on the doorstep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 6]: broke in Hilton Fenley shrilly .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 6]: His utterance was nearly hysterical .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 11]: Farrow 's judicial calm appeared to stir him to frenzy .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 20]: He clamored for action , for zealous scouting , and this orderly investigation by mere words was absolutely maddening .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 15]: `` I 'm not wastin ' time , sir , '' said Farrow respectfully .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 30]: `` It 's as certain as anything can be that the murderer , if murder has been done , has not got away by either of the gates . ''
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 8]: `` If murder has been done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 3]: cried Fenley .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 6]: `` What do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 44]: Go and look at my poor father 's corpse -- '' `` Of course , Mr. Fenley is dead , sir , an ' sorry I am to hear of it ; but the affair may turn out to be an accident . ''
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 3]: `` Accident !
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 9]: Farrow , you 're talking like an idiot .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 33]: A man is shot dead at his own front door , in a house standing in the midst of a big estate , and you tell me it 's an accident ! ''
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 11]: I on ' y mentioned that on the off chance .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 21]: Queer things do happen , an ' one should n't lose sight of that fact just because it 's unusual .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 32]: Now , sir , with your permission , I want Brodie , an ' Smith , an ' all the men servants you can spare for the next half hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 28]: `` Brodie can motor to the Inspector 's office , an ' tell him wot he knows , stoppin ' on the way to send Jenkins here .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 27]: Some of us must search the woods thoroughly , while others watch the open park , to make sure no one escapes without bein ' seen .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 20]: It 's my firm belief that the man who fired that rifle is still hidin ' among those trees .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 24]: He may be sneakin ' off now , but we 'd see him if we 're quick in reachin ' the other side .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 10]: Will you do as I ask , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 18]: Farrow was already in motion when Fenley 's dazed mind recalled something the policeman ought to know .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 16]: `` I 've telephoned to Scotland Yard half an hour ago , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 8]: `` That 's all right , sir .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 13]: The main thing now is to search every inch of the woods .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 10]: If nothing else , we may find footprints . ''
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 9]: `` And make plenty of new ones . ''
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 14]: `` Not if the helpers do as I tell 'em , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 6]: `` I ca n't argue .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 7]: I 'm not fit for it .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 14]: Still , some instinct warns me you are not adopting the best course .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 18]: I think you ought to go in the car and put the police into combined action . ''
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 9]: `` What are they to do , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 17]: The murderer wo n't carry a rifle through the village , or along the open road .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 13]: I fancy we 'll come across the weapon itself in the wood .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 15]: Besides , the Inspector will do all that is necessary when Brodie sees him .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 13]: Reelly , sir , I _ know _ I 'm right . ''
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 9]: `` But should that artist be questioned ? ''
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 8]: `` Of course he will , sir .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 6]: He wo n't run away .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 10]: If he does , we 'll soon nab him .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 24]: He 's been stayin ' at the White Horse Inn the last two days , an ' is quite a nice-spoken young gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 12]: Why should _ he _ want to shoot Mr. Fenley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 13]: `` He is annoyed with my father , for one thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 3]: `` Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 5]: Wot , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 22]: Farrow , hitherto eager to be off on the hunt , stopped as if he heard a statement of real importance .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 9]: Hilton Fenley pressed a hand to his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 12]: `` It was nothing to speak of , '' he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 47]: `` He wrote asking permission to sketch the house , and my father refused -- just why I do n't know ; some business matter had vexed him that day , I fancy , and he dashed off the refusal on the spur of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 25]: But a man does not commit a terrible crime for so slight a cause ... Oh , if only my head would cease throbbing !
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 6]: ... Do as you like .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 10]: Bates , see that every assistance is given . ''
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 7]: Fenley walked a few paces unsteadily .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 19]: Obviously he was incapable of lucid thought , and the mere effort at sustained conversation was a torture .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 19]: He turned through a yew arch into the Italian garden , and threw himself wearily into a seat .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 5]: `` Poor young fellow !
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 11]: He 's fair off his nut , '' whispered Bates .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 7]: `` What can one expect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 3]: said Farrow .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 7]: `` But we must get busy .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 4]: Where 's Brodie ?
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 8]: Do go an ' find him . ''
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 8]: Bates jerked a thumb toward the house .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 10]: `` He 's in there , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 11]: `` He helped to carry in the Gov ` nor .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 7]: Has n't left him since . ''
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 7]: `` He must come at once .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 21]: He ca n't do any good now , an ' we 've lost nearly an hour as it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 8]: The chauffeur appeared , red-eyed and white-faced .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 17]: But he understood the urgency of his mission , and soon had the car in movement .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 26]: Others came -- the butler , some gardeners , and men engaged in stables and garage , for the dead banker maintained a large establishment .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 5]: Farrow explained his plan .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 56]: They would beat the woods methodically , and the searcher who noted anything `` unusual '' -- the word was often on the policeman 's lips -- was not to touch or disturb the object or sign in any way , but its whereabouts should be marked by a broken branch stuck in the ground .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 16]: Of course , if a stranger was seen , an alarm should be raised instantly .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 17]: The little party was making for the Quarry Wood , when Jenkins arrived on a bicycle .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 15]: The first intimation he had received of the murder was the chauffeur 's message .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 18]: There was a telephone between house and lodge , but no one had thought of using it .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 31]: `` Now , Bates , '' said Farrow , when the squad of men had spread out in line , `` you an ' me will take the likeliest line .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 31]: You ought to know every spot in the covert where it 's possible to aim a gun at any one stannin ' on top of the steps at The Towers .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 8]: There ca n't be many such places .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 5]: Is there even one ?
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 16]: I do n't suppose the barefaced scoundrel would dare come out into the open drive .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 37]: Brodie said Mr. Fenley was shot through the right side while facin ' the car , so he bears out both your notion an ' Mr. Trenholme 's that the bullet kem from the Quarry Wood .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 9]: What 's _ your _ idea about it ?
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 20]: Have you one , or are you just as much in the dark as the rest of us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 6]: Bates was sour-faced with perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 48]: The killing of his employer was already crystallizing in his thoughts into an irrevocable thing , for the butler had lifted aside the dead man 's coat and waistcoat , and this had shown him the ghastly evidences of a wound which must have been instantly fatal .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 23]: Now , a shrewd if narrow intelligence was concentrated on the one tremendous question , `` Who hath done this thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 49]: He looked so worried that the yellow dog , watching him , and quick to interpret his moods , slouched warily at heel ; and Farrow , though agog with excitement , saw that his crony was ill at ease because of some twinge of fear or suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 26]: `` Speak out , Jim , '' he urged , dropping his voice to a confidential pitch , lest one of the others might overhear .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 11]: `` Gim me the straight tip , if you can .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 12]: It need never be known that it kem from you . ''
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 17]: `` I 've a good berth here , '' muttered the keeper , with seeming irrelevance .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 31]: `` Tell me something fresh , '' said Farrow , quickening with grateful memories of many a pheasant and brace of rabbits reposing a brief space in his modest larder .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 25]: `` So , if I tell you things in confidence like -- '' `` I 've heard 'em from any one but you . ''
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 15]: Bates drew a deep breath , only to expel it fiercely between puffed lips .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 10]: `` It 's this way , '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 32]: `` Mr. Robert an ' the ol' man did n't hit off , an ' there was a deuce of a row between 'em the other day , Saturday it was .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 39]: My niece , Mary , was a-dustin ' the banisters when the two kem out from breakfast , an ' she heerd the Gov ` nor say : ` That 's my last word on the subjec ' .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 10]: I mean to be obeyed this time . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 35]: ` But , look here , pater , ' said Mr. Robert -- he always calls his father pater , ye know -- ' I reelly ca n't arrange matters in that offhand way .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 7]: You must give me time . '
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 10]: ` Not another minute , ' said Mr. Fenley .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 22]: ` Oh , dash it all , ' said Mr. Robert , ` you 're enough to drive a fellow crazy .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 11]: At times I almost forget that I 'm your son .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 18]: Some fellows would be tempted to blow their brains out , an ' yours , too . '
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 33]: `` At that , Tomlinson broke in , an ' grabbed Mr. Robert 's arm , an ' the Gov ` nor went off in the car in a fine ol' temper .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 22]: Mr. Robert left The Towers on his motor bike soon afterward , an ' he has n't been back since . ''
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 24]: Although the fount of information temporarily ran dry , Farrow felt that there was more to come if its secret springs were tapped .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 15]: `` Did Mary drop a hint as to what the row was about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 13]: `` She guessed it had something to do with Miss Sylvia . ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 6]: `` Why Miss Sylvia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 15]: `` She an ' Mr. Robert are pretty good friends , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 5]: `` I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 17]: The policeman saw little , but each scrap of news might fit into its place presently .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 6]: `` Is that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 4]: he went on .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 25]: They were nearing that part of the wood where care must be exercised , and he wanted Bates to talk while in the vein .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 29]: `` No , not by a long way , '' burst out the keeper , seemingly unable to contain any longer the deadly knowledge weighing on his conscience .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 44]: `` Do n't you try an ' hold me to it , Farrow , or I 'll swear black an ' blue I never said it ; but I knew the ring of the shot that killed my poor ol' guv ` nor .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 32]: It was fired from an express rifle , an ' there 's on ' y one of the sort in Roxton , so far as _ I 've _ ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 23]: An ' it is , or ought to be , in Mr. Robert 's sittin ' - room at this very minute .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 6]: Now you 've got it .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 5]: Do as you like .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 20]: Get Tomlinson to talk , or anybody else , but keep me out of it -- d'ye hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 39]: `` I hear , '' said Farrow , thrilling with the consciousness that when some dandy detective arrived from the `` Yard , '' he would receive an eye-opener from a certain humble member of the Hertfordshire constabulary .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 15]: Not that he quite brought himself to believe Robert Fenley his father 's murderer .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 6]: That was going rather far .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 13]: That would , indeed , be a monstrous assumption as matters stood .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 21]: But as clues the quarrel and the rifle were excellent , and Scotland Yard must recognize them in that light .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 13]: Certainly , this _ was _ an unusual case ; most unusual .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 27]: He was well aware of the reputation attached to Robert Fenley , the banker 's younger son , who differed from his brother in every essential .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 27]: Hilton was steady-going , business-like , his father 's secretary and right hand in affairs , both in the bank and in matters affecting the estate .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 19]: Robert , almost unmanageable as a youth , had grown into an exceedingly rapid young man about town .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 45]: But Roxton folk feared Hilton and liked Robert ; and local gossip had deplored Robert 's wildness , which might erect an insurmountable barrier against an obviously suitable match between him and Mr. Mortimer Fenley 's ward , the rich and beautiful Sylvia Manning .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 43]: These things were vivid in the policeman 's mind , and he was wondering how the puzzle would explain itself in the long run , when an exclamation from Bates brought his vagrom speculations sharply back to the problem of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 34]: The keeper , of course , as Farrow had said , was making straight for the one place in the Quarry Wood which commanded a clear view of the entrance to the mansion .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 54]: The two men were skirting the disused quarry , now a rabbit warren , which gave the locality its name ; they followed the rising edge of the excavation , treading on a broad strip of turf , purposely freed of encroaching briers lest any wandering stranger might plunge headlong into the pit .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 36]: Near the highest part of the rock wall there was a slight depression in the ground ; and here , except during the height of a phenomenally dry Summer , the surface was always moist .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 10]: Bates , who was leading , had halted suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 8]: He pointed to three well marked footprints .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 16]: `` Who 's been here , an ' not so long ago , neither ? ''
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 25]: he said , darting ferret eyes now at the telltale marks and now into the quarry beneath or through the solemn aisle of trees .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 17]: `` Stick in some twigs , an ' let 's hurry on , '' said Farrow .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 17]: `` Footprints are first rate , but they 'll keep for an hour or two . ''
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 23]: Thirty yards away , and somewhat to the right , a hump of rock formed the Mont Blanc of that tiny Alp .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 23]: From its summit , and from no other part of the wood , they could see the east front of The Towers .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 47]: In fact , while perched there , having climbed its shoulder with great care lest certain definite tokens of a recent intruder should be obliterated , they discovered a dusty motor car ranged between the doctor 's runabout and the Fenley limousine , which had returned .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 34]: The doctor and Miss Sylvia Manning were standing on the broad mosaic which adorned the landing above the steps , standing exactly where Mortimer Fenley had stood when he was stricken to death .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 41]: With them were two strangers : one tall , burly and official-looking ; the other a shrunken little man , whose straw hat , short jacket , and clean-shaven face conveyed , at the distance , a curiously juvenile aspect .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 32]: Halfway down the steps were Hilton Fenley and Brodie , and all were gazing fixedly at that part of the wood where the keeper and the policeman had popped into view .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 4]: `` Hello ! ''
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 3]: said Bates .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 8]: `` Who is that little lot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 12]: Clearly , he meant the big man and his diminutive companion .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 4]: Farrow coughed importantly .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 10]: `` That 's Scotland Yard , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 6]: `` Detectives from the Yard .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 6]: Mr. Hilton telephoned for 'em .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 14]: An ' wot 's more , they 're signalin ' to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 12]: `` They want us to go back , '' said Bates .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 4]: `` Mebbe . ''
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 11]: `` There ca n't be any doubt about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 23]: And , indeed , only a blind man could have been skeptical as to the wishes of the group near the door .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 15]: `` I 'm goin ' through this wood first , '' announced Farrow firmly .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 7]: `` Mind how you get down .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 6]: Them marks may be useful .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 13]: I 'm almost sure the scoundrel fired from this very spot . ''
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 13]: `` Looks like it , '' agreed Bates , and they descended .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 17]: Five minutes later they were in the open park , where their assistant scouts awaited them .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 29]: None of the others had found any indication of a stranger 's presence , and Farrow led them to the house in Indian file , by a path .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 12]: `` Scotland Yard is on the job , '' he announced .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 16]: `` Now we 'll be told just wot we reelly ought to have done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 32]: He did not even exchange a furtive glance with Bates , but , for the life of him he could not restrain a note of triumph from creeping into his voice .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 45]: He noticed , too , that Tomlinson , the butler , not only looked white and shaken , which was natural under the circumstances , but had the haggard aspect of a stout man who may soon become thin by stress of fearsome imaginings .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 8]: Farrow did not put it that way .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 11]: `` Bates is right , '' he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 8]: `` Tomlinson has something on his chest .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 16]: By jingo , this affair _ is _ a one-er an ' no mistake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 44]: At any rate , local talent had no intention of kowtowing too deeply before the majesty of the `` Yard , '' for the Chief of the Criminal Investigation Department himself could have achieved no more in the time than Police Constable Farrow .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 47]: CHAPTER III THE HOUNDS Superintendent James Leander Winter , Chief of the Criminal Investigation Department at Scotland Yard , had just opened the morning 's letters , and was virtuously resisting the placid charms of an open box of cigars , when the telephone bell rang .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 7]: The speaker was the Assistant Commissioner .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 18]: `` Leave everything else , and motor to Roxton , '' said the calm voice of authority .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 24]: `` Mr. Mortimer Fenley , a private banker in the City , was shot dead about nine thirty at his own front door .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 22]: His place is The Towers , which stands in a park between the villages of Roxton and Easton , in Hertfordshire .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 58]: His son , who has just telephoned here , believes that a rifle was fired from a neighboring wood , but several minutes elapsed before any one realized that the banker was shot , the first impression of the servants who ran to his assistance when he staggered and fell being that he was suffering from apoplexy .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 22]: By the time the cause of death was discovered the murderer could have escaped , so no immediate search was organized .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 27]: Mr. Hilton Fenley , a son , who spoke with difficulty , explained that he thought it best to ` phone here after summoning a doctor .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 24]: The dead man is of some importance in the City , so I want you to take personal charge of the inquiry . ''
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 4]: The voice ceased .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 12]: Mr. Winter , while listening , had glanced at a clock .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 9]: `` Nine thirty this morning , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 6]: The son lost no time .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 11]: The affair happened a quarter of an hour ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 9]: `` I 'll start in five minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 3]: `` Good .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 11]: By the way , who will go with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 5]: `` Mr. Furneaux . ''
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 3]: `` Excellent .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 9]: I leave matters in your hands , Superintendent .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 14]: Let me hear the facts if you return to town before six . ''
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 13]: Evidently the Roxton murder was one of the year 's big events .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 9]: It loomed large already in the official mind .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 54]: Winter called up various departments in quick succession , gave a series of orders , sorted his letters hastily , thrusting some into a drawer and others into a basket on the table , and was lighting a cigar when the door opened and his trusted aide , Detective Inspector Furneaux , entered .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 4]: `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 51]: cackled the newcomer ; for Winter had confided to him , only the day before , certain reasons why the habit of smoking to excess was injurious , and his -LRB- Winter 's -RRB- resolve to cut down the day 's cigars to three , one after each principal meal .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 25]: `` Circumstances alter cases , '' said the Superintendent blandly , scrutinizing the Havana to make sure that the outer leaf was burning evenly .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 25]: `` You and I are off for a jaunt in the country , Charles , and the sternest disciplinarian unbends during holiday time . ''
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 21]: `` Scotland Yard , as well as the other place , is paved with good intentions , '' said Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 22]: Winter stooped , and took a couple of automatic pistols from a drawer in the desk at which he was seated .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 13]: `` Put one of those in your pocket , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 7]: Again did his colleague smile derisively .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 13]: `` So it is only a ` bus driver 's holiday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 5]: `` One never knows .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 12]: Some prominent banker , name of Fenley , has been shot .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 7]: There may be more shooting . ''
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 3]: `` Fenley ?
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 5]: Not Mortimer Fenley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 6]: Do you know him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 22]: `` Better than I know you ; because you often puzzle me , whereas he struck me as a respectable swindler .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 36]: Do n't you remember those bonds which disappeared so mysteriously two months ago from the safe of the Mortgage and Discount Bank , and were all sold in Paris before the loss was discovered ? ''
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 4]: `` By Jove !
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 6]: Is that the Fenley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 4]: `` None other .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 35]: Of course , you were hob-nobbing with royalty at the time , so such a trifle as the theft of ten thousand pounds ' worth of negotiable securities did n't trouble you a bit .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 10]: I see you 're wearing the pin today . ''
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 20]: `` So would you wear it , if an Emperor deigned to take notice of such a shrimp . ''
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 6]: `` Shrimp you call me !
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 13]: Imagine a lobster sticking rubies and diamonds into a heliotrope tie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 4]: Winter winked solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 18]: `` I picked up some wrinkles in color blends at the Futurist Exhibition , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 14]: `` But here 's Johnston to tell us the car is ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 19]: The oddly assorted pair followed the constable in uniform , now hurrying ahead to ring for the elevator .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 76]: The big , bluff , bullet-headed Superintendent was physically well fitted for his responsible position , though he combined with the official demeanor some of the easy-going characteristics of a country squire ; but Charles Fran√ßois Furneaux was so unlike the detective of romance and the stage that he often found it difficult to persuade strangers that he was really the famous detective inspector they had heard of in connection with many a celebrated trial .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 25]: On the other hand , if one were told that he hailed from the Com√©die Fran√ßaise , the legend would be accepted without demur .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 41]: He had the clean-shaven , wrinkled face of the comedian ; his black eyes sparkled with an active intelligence ; an expressive mouth bespoke clear and fluent speech ; his quick , alert movements were those of the mimetic actor .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 25]: Winter stood six feet in height , and weighed two hundred and ten pounds ; Furneaux was six inches shorter and eighty pounds lighter .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 32]: The one was a typical John Bull , the other a Channel Islander of pure French descent , and never did more curiously assorted couple follow the trail of a criminal .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 15]: Yet , if noteworthy when acting apart , they were almost infallible in combination .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 39]: More than one eminent scoundrel had either blown out his brains or given himself up to the law when he knew that the Big ` Un and Little ` Un of the Yard were hot on his track .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 31]: Winter seldom failed to arrive at the only sound conclusion from ascertained facts , whereas Furneaux had an almost uncanny knowledge of the kinks and obliquities of the criminal mind .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 34]: In the phraseology of logic , Winter applied the deductive method and Furneaux the inductive ; when both fastened on to the same `` suspect '' the unlucky wight was in parlous state .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 31]: It may be taken for granted , therefore , that the Assistant Commissioner knew what he was about in uttering his satisfaction at the Superintendent 's choice of an assistant .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 22]: Possibly he had the earlier bond robbery in mind , and expected now that another `` mystery '' would be solved .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 12]: Scotland Yard guards many secrets which shirk the glare of publicity .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 45]: Some may never be explained ; but by far the larger proportion are cleared up unexpectedly by incidents which may occur months or years afterward , and whose connection with the original crime is indiscernible until some chance discovery lays bare the hidden clue .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 28]: One queer feature of the partnership between the two was their habit of chaffing and bickering at each other during the early stages of a joint hunt .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 28]: They were like hounds giving tongue joyously when laid on the scent ; dangerous then , they became mute and deadly when the quarry was in sight .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 40]: In private life they were firm friends ; officially , Furneaux was Winter 's subordinate , but that fact neither silenced the Jersey man 's sarcastic tongue nor stopped Winter from roasting his assistant unmercifully if an opportunity offered .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 38]: Their chauffeur took the line through the parks to the Edgware Road , and they talked of anything save `` shop '' until the speed limit was off and the car was responding gayly to the accelerator .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 32]: Then Winter threw away the last inch of a good cigar , involuntarily put his hand to a well-filled case for its successor , sighed , and dropped his hand again .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 16]: `` Force of habit , '' he said , finding Furneaux 's eye on him .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 13]: `` I did n't even think evil , '' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 14]: `` I really must n't smoke so much , '' said Winter plaintively .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 13]: `` Oh , for goodness ' sake light up and be happy .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 22]: If you sit there nursing your self-righteousness you 'll be like a bear with a sore head before we pass Stanmore .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 5]: Besides , consider me .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 19]: I like the smell of tobacco , though my finer nervous system will not endure its use . ''
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 16]: `` Finer fiddlesticks , '' said Winter , cutting the end off a fresh Havana .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 11]: `` Now tell me about Fenley and the ten thousand .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 6]: What 's his other name ?
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 9]: I forget -- Alexander , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 6]: `` No , nor Xenophon .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 3]: Just Mortimer .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 22]: He ran a private bank in Bishopsgate Street , and that , as you know , generally hides a company promoter .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 10]: Frankly , I was bothered by Fenley at first .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 30]: I believe he lost the bonds right enough , for he gave the numbers , and was horribly upset when it was found they had been sold in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 26]: But , to my idea , he either stole them himself and was relieved of them later or was victimized by one of his sons .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 51]: `` The only other person who could have taken them was the cashier , a hoary-headed old boy who resides at Epping , and has not changed his method of living since he first wore a silk hat and caught the eight-forty to the City one morning fifty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 9]: I followed him home on a Saturday afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 24]: The bookstall clerk at Liverpool Street handed him _ The Amateur Gardener _ , and the old boy read it in the train .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 19]: Five minutes after he had reached his house he was out on the lawn with a daisy fork .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 12]: No ; the cashier did n't arrange the Paris sale . ''
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 7]: `` What of the sons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 34]: `` The elder , Hilton Fenley , is a neurotic , like myself , so he would shine with equal luster as a saint , or a detective , or a dyed-in-the-wool thief .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 20]: The younger , Robert , ought to be an explorer , or a steeplechase jockey , or an airman .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 9]: In reality , he is a first-rate wastrel .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 28]: In my distress I harked back to the old man , to whom the loss of the bonds represented something considerably less than a year 's expenditure .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 22]: He is mixed up in all sorts of enterprises -- rubber , tea , picture palaces , breweries and automobile finance .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 10]: He lent fifty thousand pounds on five per cent .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 21]: first mortgage bonds to one firm at Coventry , and half that amount to a rival show in West London .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 11]: So he has the stuff , and plenty of it .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 6]: Yet -- '' Winter nodded .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 8]: `` I know the sort of man .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 15]: Dealing in millions today ; tomorrow in the dock at the Old Bailey . ''
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 22]: `` The point is that Fenley has never dealt in millions , and has kept his head high for twenty years .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 8]: Just twenty years , by the way .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 6]: Before that he was unknown .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 12]: He began by the amalgamation of some tea plantations in Assam .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 7]: Fine word , ` amalgamation . '
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 8]: It means money , all the time .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 10]: Ca n't we amalgamate something , or somebody ? ''
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 11]: `` In Fenley 's case it led to assassination . ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 3]: `` Perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 30]: I have a feeling in my bones that if I knew who touched the proceeds of those bonds I might understand why some one shot Fenley this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 24]: `` I 'll soon tell you a trivial thing like that , '' said Winter , affecting a close interest in the landscape .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 16]: `` I should n't be at all surprised if you did , '' said Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 9]: `` You have the luck of a Carnegie .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 30]: Look at the way you bungled that affair of Lady Morris 's diamonds , until you happened to see her maid meeting Gentleman George at the White City . ''
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 4]: Winter smoked complacently .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 11]: `` Smartest thing I ever did , '' he chortled .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 25]: `` Fixed on the thief within half an hour , and never lost touch till I knew how she had worked the job . ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 7]: `` The Bow Street method . ''
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 18]: `` Why did n't you try something of the sort with regard to Fenley 's bonds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 13]: `` I could n't be crude , even with a City financier .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 47]: I put it gently that the money was in the family ; he blinked at me like an owl , said that he would give thought to the suggestion , and shut down the inquiry by telephone before I reached the Yard from his office . ''
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 9]: `` Oh , he did , did he ?
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 19]: It seems to me you 've made a pretty good guess in associating the bonds and the murder .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 10]: You 've seen both sons , of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 6]: `` Yes , often . ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 10]: `` Are there other members of the family ? ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 28]: `` An invalid wife , never away from The Towers ; and a young lady , Miss Sylvia Manning -- a ward , and worth a pile .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 8]: By the way , she 's twenty .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 19]: Mortimer Fenley , had he lived , was appointed her guardian and trustee till she reached twenty-one . ''
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 4]: `` Twenty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 3]: mused Winter .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 10]: `` Yes , twice ten , '' snapped Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 15]: `` And Fenley has cut a figure in the City for twenty years . ''
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 16]: `` I was sure your gray matter would be stimulated by its favorite poison . ''
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 11]: `` Charles , this should be an easy thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 7]: `` I 'm not so sure .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 19]: Dead men tell no tales , and Fenley himself could probably supply many chapters of an exciting story .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 5]: They will be missing .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 15]: Look at the repeated failures of eminent authors to complete ` Edwin Drood . '
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 13]: How would they have fared if asked to produce the beginning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 12]: `` Still , I 'm glad you attended to those bonds .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 9]: Who had charge of the Paris end ? ''
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 5]: `` Jacques Faure . ''
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 8]: `` Ah , a good man . ''
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 9]: `` Pretty fair , for a Frenchman . ''
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 3]: Winter laughed .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 6]: `` You born frog ! ''
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 13]: he cried ... `` Hello , there 's a Roxton sign post .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 7]: Now let 's compose our features .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 7]: We are near The Towers . ''
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 18]: The estate figured on the county map , so the chauffeur pulled up at the right gate .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 28]: A woman came from the lodge to inquire their business , and admitted the car when told that its occupants had been summoned by Mr. Hilton Fenley .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 18]: `` By the way , '' said Furneaux carelessly , `` is Mr. Robert at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 6]: `` No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 7]: `` When did he leave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 12]: `` I 'm sure I do n't know , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 13]: Mrs. Bates knew quite well , and Furneaux knew that she knew .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 21]: `` The country domestic is the detective 's aversion , '' he said as the car whirred into the avenue .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 38]: `` The lady of the lodge will be a sufficiently tough proposition if we try to drag information out of her , but the real tug of war will come when we tackle the family butler . ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 13]: `` Her husband is also the head keeper , '' said Winter .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 9]: `` Name of Bates , '' added Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 12]: `` Oh , you 've been here before , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 24]: While you were taking stock of the kennels generally , I was deciphering a printed label on a box of dog biscuit . ''
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 17]: `` I hardly feel that I 've begun this inquiry yet , '' said Winter airily .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 8]: `` You 'd better pull yourself together .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 21]: The dead man 's limousine is still waiting at the door , and the local doctor is in attendance . ''
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 10]: `` Walter J. Stern , M.D. '' `` Probably .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 17]: That brass plate on the Georgian house in the center of the village positively glistened . ''
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 27]: They were received by Hilton Fenley himself , all the available men servants having been transferred to the cohort organized and directed by Police Constable Farrow .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 11]: `` Good morning , Mr. Furneaux , '' said Fenley .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 30]: `` I little thought , when last we met , that I should be compelled to seek your help so soon again , and under such dreadful circumstances . ''
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 28]: Furneaux , whose face could display at will a Japanese liveliness of expression or become a mask of Indian gravity , surveyed the speaker with inscrutable eyes .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 15]: `` This is Superintendent Winter , Chief of my Department , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 21]: `` The Assistant Commissioner told me to take charge of the inquiry without delay , sir , '' explained Winter .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 6]: He glanced at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 10]: `` We have not been long on the road .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 9]: It is only twenty minutes to eleven . ''
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 14]: Fenley led them through a spacious hall into a dining-room on the left .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 24]: On an oak settee at the back of the hall the outline of a white sheet was eloquent of the grim object beneath .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 14]: In the dining-room were an elderly man and a slim , white-faced girl .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 35]: Had Trenholme been present he would have noted with interest that her dress was of white muslin dotted with tiny blue spots -- not _ fleurs de lys _ , but rather resembling them .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 16]: `` Dr. Stern , and Miss Sylvia Manning , '' said Fenley to the newcomers .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 10]: Then he introduced the Scotland Yard men in turn .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 18]: By this time the young head of the family had schooled himself to a degree of self-control .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 37]: His sallow skin held a greenish pallor , and as if to satisfy some instinct that demanded movement he took an occasional slow stride across the parquet floor or brushed a hand wearily over his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 22]: Otherwise he had mastered his voice , and spoke without the gasping pauses which had made distressful his words to Farrow .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 31]: `` Ours is a sad errand , Mr. Fenley , '' began Winter , after a hasty glance at the table , which still bore the disordered array of breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 20]: `` But , if you feel equal to the task , you might tell us exactly what happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 3]: Fenley nodded .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 12]: `` Of course , of course , '' he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 5]: `` That is essential .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 14]: We three , my father , Miss Manning and myself , breakfasted together .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 17]: The second gong goes every morning at eight forty-five , and we were fairly punctual today .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 21]: My father and Sylvia , Miss Manning , came in together -- they had been talking in the hall previously .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 11]: I saw them entering the room as I came downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 41]: During the meal we chatted about affairs in the East ; that is , my father and I did , and Syl -- Miss Manning -- gave us some news of a church bazaar in which she is taking part .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 20]: `` My father rose first and went to his room , to collect papers brought from the City overnight .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 17]: I met him on the stairs , and he gave me some instructions about a prospectus .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 35]: -LRB- Let me interpolate that I was going to Victoria by a later train , having an appointment at eleven o'clock with Lord Ventnor , chairman of a company we are bringing out . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 27]: I stood on the stairs , saying something , while my father crossed the hall and took his hat and gloves from Harris , the footman .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 24]: As I passed along the gallery to my own room I saw him standing on the landing at the top of the steps .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 27]: `` He was cutting the end off a cigar , and Harris was just behind him and a little to the left , striking a match .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 10]: Every fine morning my father lighted a cigar there .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 13]: In rain or high wind he would light up inside the house .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 28]: By the way , my mother is an invalid , and dislikes the smell of tobacco , so unless we have guests we do n't smoke indoors .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 21]: `` Well , I had reached my room , a sitting-room adjoining my bedroom , when I heard a gunshot .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 22]: Apparently it came from the Quarry Wood , and I was surprised , because there is no shooting at this season .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 13]: A little later -- some few seconds -- I heard Sylvia scream .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 11]: I did not rush out instantly to discover the cause .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 9]: Young ladies sometimes scream at wasps and caterpillars .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 34]: Then I heard Tomlinson say , ` Fetch Mr. Hilton at once , ' and I ran into Harris , who blurted out , ` Mr. Fenley has been shot , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 15]: `` After that , I scarcely know what I said or how I acted .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 29]: I remember running downstairs , and finding my father lying outside the front door , with Sylvia supporting his head and Tomlinson and Brodie trying to lift him .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 27]: I think -- in fact , I am sure now from what Dr. Stern tells me -- that my father was dead before I reached him .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 39]: We all thought at first that he had yielded to some awfully sudden form of paralysis , but some one -- Tomlinson , I believe -- noticed a hole through the right side of his coat and waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 33]: Then Sylvia -- oh , perhaps that is matterless -- '' `` Every incident , however slight , is of importance in a case of this sort , '' Winter encouraged him .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 12]: `` Well , she said -- what was it , exactly ?
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 7]: Do you remember , Sylvia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 10]: `` Certainly , '' said the girl , unhesitatingly .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 15]: `` I said that I thought I recognized the sound of Bob 's .450 .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 7]: Why should n't I say it ?
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 9]: Poor Bob did n't shoot his father . ''
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 25]: Her voice , though singularly musical , had a tearful ring which became almost hysterical in the vehemence of the question and its disclaimer .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 23]: Fenley moved uneasily , and raised his right hand to his eyes , while the left grasped the back of a chair .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 35]: `` Bob is my brother Robert , who is away from home at this moment , '' he said , and his tone deprecated the mere allusion to the rifle owned by the absentee .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 26]: `` I only mentioned Miss Manning 's words to show how completely at a loss we all were to account for my father 's wound .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 15]: I helped Tomlinson and Brodie to carry him to the settee in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 14]: Then we -- Tomlinson , that is -- opened his waistcoat and shirt .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 14]: Tomlinson cut the shirt with a scissors , and we saw the wound .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 58]: Dr. Stern says there are indications that an expanding bullet was used , so the injuries must have been something appalling ... Sylvia , do n't you think -- '' `` I 'll not faint , or make a scene , if that is what you are afraid of , Hilton , '' said the girl bravely .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 24]: `` That is all , then , or nearly all , '' went on Fenley , in the same dreary , monotonous voice .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 25]: `` I telephoned to Dr. Stern , and to Scotland Yard , deeming it better to communicate with you than with the local police .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 31]: But it seems that Bates , our head keeper hurrying to investigate the cause of the shot , met some artist coming away from the other side of the wood .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 28]: The Roxton police constable too , met and spoke with the same man , who told both Bates and the policeman that he heard the shot fired .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 33]: The policeman , Farrow , refused to arrest the artist , and is now searching the wood with a number of our men -- '' `` Ca n't they be stopped ? ''
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 10]: broke in Furneaux , speaking for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 16]: `` Yes , of course , '' and Hilton Fenley became a trifle more animated .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 23]: `` I wanted Farrow to wait till you came , but he insisted -- said the murderer might be hiding there . ''
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 7]: `` When did Farrow arrive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 14]: `` Oh , more than half an hour after my father was shot .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 14]: I forgot to mention that my mother knows nothing of the tragedy yet .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 14]: That is why we did not carry my poor father 's body upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 14]: She might overhear the shuffling of feet , and ask the cause . ''
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 21]: `` One thing more , Mr. Fenley , '' said Winter , seeing that the other had made an end .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 32]: `` Have you the remotest reason to believe that any person harbored a grievance against your father such as might lead to the commission of a crime of this nature ? ''
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 30]: `` I 've been torturing my mind with that problem since I realized that my father was dead , and I can say candidly that he had no enemies .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 27]: Of course , in business , one interferes occasionally with other men 's projects , but people in the City do not shoot successful opponents . ''
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 5]: `` No private feud ?
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 13]: No dismissed servant , sent off because of theft or drunkenness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 8]: `` Absolutely none , to my knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 16]: The youngest man on the estate has been employed here five or six years . ''
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 12]: `` It is a very extraordinary crime , Mr. Fenley . ''
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 17]: For answer , the other sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 13]: `` How can we get those clodhoppers out of the wood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 3]: said Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 15]: His thin , high-pitched voice dispelled the tension , and Fenley dropped his hands .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 21]: `` Bates is certain to make for a rock which commands a view of the house , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 16]: `` Perhaps , if we go to the door , we may see them . ''
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 11]: He arose with obvious effort , but walked steadily enough .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 24]: Winter followed with the doctor , and inquired in an undertone -- `` Are you sure about the soft-nosed bullet , doctor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 8]: `` Quite , '' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 16]: `` I was in the Tirah campaign , and saw hundreds of such wounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 12]: Furneaux , too , had something to say to Miss Manning .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 9]: `` How were you seated during breakfast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 4]: She showed him .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 6]: It was a large room .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 21]: Two windows looked down the avenue , and three into the garden , with its background of timber and park .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 25]: Mr. Mortimer Fenley could have commanded both views ; his son sat with his back to the park ; the girl had faced it .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 21]: `` I need hardly put it to you , but you saw no one in or near the trees ? ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 3]: said Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 5]: `` Not a soul .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 33]: I bathe in a little lake below those cedars every morning , and it is an estate order that the men do not go in that direction between eight and nine o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 19]: Of course , a keeper might have passed at nine thirty , but it is most unlikely . ''
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 8]: `` Did you bathe this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 8]: `` Yes , soon after eight . ''
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 13]: `` Did you see the artist of whom Mr. Fenley spoke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 11]: This is the first I have heard of any artist .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 13]: Bates must have mentioned him while I was with Dr. Stern . ''
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 37]: When Farrow arrived at the head of his legion he was just in time to salute his Inspector , who had cycled from Easton after receiving the news left by the chauffeur at the police station .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 28]: Farrow was bursting with impatience to reveal the discoveries he had made , though resolved to keep locked in his own breast the secret confided by Bates .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 35]: He was thoroughly nonplussed , therefore , when Winter , after listening in silence to the account of the footprints and scratches on the moss-covered surface of the rock , turned to Hilton Fenley .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 17]: `` With reference to the rifle which has been mentioned -- where is it kept ? ''
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 7]: `` In my brother 's room .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 18]: He bought it nearly a year ago , when he was planning an expedition to Somaliland . ''
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 7]: `` May I see it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 17]: Fenley signed to the butler , who was standing with the others at a little distance .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 19]: `` You know the .450 Express which is in the gun rack in Mr. Robert 's den ? ''
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 8]: `` Bring it to the Superintendent . ''
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 24]: Tomlinson , shaken but dignified , and rather purple of face as the result of the tramp through the trees , went indoors .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 16]: Soon he came back , and the rich tint had faded again from his complexion .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 19]: `` Sorry , sir , '' he said huskily , `` but the rifle is not there . ''
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 5]: `` Not there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 16]: It was Sylvia Manning who spoke ; the others received this sinister fact in silence .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 6]: `` No , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 7]: `` Are you quite sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 3]: asked Fenley .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 19]: `` It is not in the gun rack , sir , nor in any of the corners . ''
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 5]: There was a pause .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 7]: Fenley clearly forced the next words .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 6]: `` That 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 9]: Bates may have it in the gun room .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 5]: We 'll ask him .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 11]: Or Mr. Robert may have taken it to the makers .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 16]: I remember now he spoke of having the sight fitted with some new appliance . ''
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 4]: He called Bates .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 12]: No , the missing rifle was not in the gun room .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 15]: Somehow the notion was forming in certain minds that it could not be there .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 21]: Indeed , the keeper 's confusion was so marked that Furneaux 's glance dwelt on him for a contemplative second .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 11]: CHAPTER IV BREAKING COVER Winter drew the local Inspector aside .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 15]: `` This inquiry rests with you in the first instance , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 11]: `` Mr. Furneaux and I are here only to assist .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 31]: Mr. Fenley telephoned to the Commissioner , mainly because Scotland Yard was called in to investigate a bond robbery which took place in the Fenley Bank some two months ago .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 7]: Probably you never heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 11]: Will you kindly explain our position to your Chief Constable ?
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 57]: Of course , we shall work with you and through you , but my colleague has reason to believe that the theft of the bonds may have some bearing on this murder , and , as the securities were disposed of in Paris , it is more than likely that the Yard may be helpful . ''
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 28]: `` I fully understand , sir , '' said the Inspector , secretly delighted at the prospect of joining in the hunt with two such renowned detectives .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 21]: The combined parishes of Easton and Roxton seldom produced a crime of greater magnitude than the theft of a duck .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 67]: The arrest of a burglar who broke into a villa , found a decanter of whisky , and got so hopelessly drunk that he woke up in a cell at the police station , was an event of such magnitude that its memory was still lively , though the leading personage was now out on ticket of leave after serving five years in various penal settlements .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 24]: `` You will prepare and give the formal evidence at the inquest , which will be opened tomorrow , '' went on Winter .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 16]: `` All that is really necessary is identification and a brief statement by the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 19]: Then the coroner will issue the burial certificate , and the inquiry should be adjourned for a fortnight .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 9]: I would recommend discretion in choosing a jury .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 6]: Avoid busybodies like the plague .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 18]: Summons only sensible men , who will do as they are told and ask no questions . ''
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 17]: `` Exactly , '' said the Inspector ; he found Machiavellian art in these simple instructions .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 13]: How it broadened the horizon to be brought in touch with London !
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 7]: Winter turned to look for Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 18]: The little man was standing where Mortimer Fenley had stood in the last moment of his life .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 8]: His eyes were fixed on the wood .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 25]: He seemed to be dreaming , but his friend well knew how much clarity and almost supernatural vision was associated with Furneaux 's dreams .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 4]: `` Charles ! ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 5]: said the Superintendent softly .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 9]: Furneaux awoke , and ran down the steps .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 36]: In his straw hat and light Summer suit he looked absurdly boyish , but the Inspector , who had formed an erroneous first impression , was positively startled when he met those blazing black eyes .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 18]: `` Mr. Fenley should warn all his servants to speak fully and candidly , '' said Winter .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 9]: `` Then we shall question the witnesses separately .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 5]: What do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 6]: Shall we start now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 15]: `` First , the boots , '' cried Furneaux , seemingly voicing a thought .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 34]: `` We want a worn pair of boots belonging to each person in the house and employed on the estate , men and women , no exceptions , including the dead man 's .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 7]: Then we 'll visit that wood .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 7]: After that , the inquiry . ''
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 3]: Winter nodded .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 18]: When Furneaux and he were in pursuit of a criminal they dropped all nice distinctions of rank .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 21]: If one made a suggestion the other adopted it without comment unless he could urge some convincing argument against it .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 13]: `` Mr. Fenley should give his orders now , '' added Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 21]: Winter explained his wishes to the nominal head of the household , and Fenley 's compliance was ready and explicit .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 27]: `` These gentlemen from Scotland Yard are acting in behalf of Mrs. Fenley , my brother and myself , '' he said to the assembled servants .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 11]: `` You must obey them as you would obey me .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 9]: I place matters unreservedly in their hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 15]: `` And our questions should be answered without reserve , '' put in Winter .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 6]: `` Yes , of course .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 4]: I implied that .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 10]: At any rate , it is clear now . ''
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 28]: `` Brodie , '' said Furneaux , seeming to pounce on the chauffeur , `` you were seated at the wheel when the shot was fired ? ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 21]: `` Ye -- yes , sir , '' stuttered Brodie , rather taken aback by the little man 's suddenness .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 9]: `` Were you looking at the wood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 11]: `` In a sort of a way , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 11]: `` Did you see any one among the trees ? ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 11]: `` No , sir , that I did n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 4]: This more confidently .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 10]: `` Place your car where it was stationed then .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 16]: Take your seat , and try to imagine that you are waiting for your master .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 17]: Start the engine , and behave exactly as though you expected him to enter the car .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 6]: Do n't watch the wood .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 31]: I mean that you are not to avoid looking at it , but just throw yourself back to the condition of mind you were in at nine twenty-five this morning .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 6]: Can you manage that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 8]: `` I think so , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 9]: `` No chatting with others , you know .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 12]: Fancy you are about to take Mr. Fenley to the station .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 12]: If you should happen to see me , wave your hand .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 10]: Then you can get down and stop the engine .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 14]: You understand you are not to keep a sharp lookout for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 24]: The butler thought it would take a quarter of an hour to collect sample pairs of boots from the house and outlying cottages .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 35]: Police Constable Farrow was instructed to bring the butler and the array of boots to the place where the footprints were found , and Bates led the detectives and the Inspector thither at once .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 25]: Soon the four men were gazing at the telltale marks , and the Inspector , of course , was ready with a shrewd comment .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 24]: `` Whoever it was that came this way , he did n't take much trouble to hide his tracks , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 16]: The Scotland Yard experts were so obviously impressed that the Inspector tried a higher flight .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 12]: `` They 're a man 's boots , '' he continued .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 15]: `` We need n't have worried Tomlinson to gather the maids ' footgear . ''
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 10]: Furneaux left two neat imprints in the damp soil .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 27]: `` Bet you a penny whistle there are at least two women in The Towers who will make bigger blobs than these , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 19]: A penny whistle , as a wager , is what Police Constable Farrow would term `` unusual . ''
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 10]: `` Quite so , '' said the Inspector thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 9]: Winter caught Furneaux 's eye , and frowned .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 16]: There was nothing to be gained by taking a rise out of the local constabulary .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 13]: Still , he gave one sharp glance at both sets of footprints .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 13]: Then he looked at Furneaux again , this time with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 12]: The party passed on to the rock on the higher ground .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 15]: Bates pointed out the old scratches , and those made by Farrow and himself .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 5]: `` Me first ! ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 9]: cried Furneaux , darting nimbly to the summit .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 16]: He was not there a second before he signaled to some one invisible from beneath .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 15]: Winter joined him , and the east front of the house burst into view .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 11]: Brodie was in the act of descending from the car .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 5]: The doctor had gone .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 23]: A small group of men were gazing at the wood , but Hilton Fenley and Sylvia Manning were not to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 6]: Neither man uttered a word .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 54]: They looked at the rock under their feet , at the surrounding trees , oak and ash , elm and larch , all of mature growth , and towering thirty to forty feet above their heads , while the rock itself rose some twelve feet from the general level of the sloping ground .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 5]: Bates was watching them .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 40]: `` The fact is , gentlemen , that if an oak an ' a couple o ' spruce first had n't been cut down you would n't see the house even from where you are , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 27]: `` Mr. Fenley had an idee of buildin ' a shelter on this rock , but he let it alone ` coss o ' the birds .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 15]: Ladies would be comin ' here , an ' a-disturbin ' of 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 5]: The detectives came down .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 24]: Furneaux , meaning to put the Inspector in the right frame of mind , said confidentially -- `` Brodie saw me instantly . ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 6]: `` Did he , now ?
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 19]: It follows that he would have seen any one who fired at Mr. Fenley from that spot . ''
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 5]: `` It almost follows .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 12]: We must guard against assuming a chance as a certainty . ''
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 6]: `` Oh , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 14]: `` And we must also try to avoid fitting facts into preconceived notions .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 22]: Now , while the butler is gathering old boots , let us spend a few profitable minutes in this locality . ''
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 15]: After that , any trace of soreness in the inspectorial breast was completely obliterated .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 21]: Both Winter and Furneaux produced strong magnifying-glasses , and scrutinized the scratches and impressions on the bare rock and moss .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 19]: Bates , skilled in wood lore , was quick to note what they had discerned at a glance .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 16]: `` Beg pardon , gentlemen both , but may I put in a word ? ''
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 4]: he muttered awkwardly .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 12]: `` As many as you like , '' Winter assured him .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 51]: `` Well , these here marks was made by Farrow an ' meself , say about ten forty , or a trifle over an hour after the murder ; an ' I have no sort o ' doubt as these other marks are a day or two days older . ''
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 14]: `` You might even put it at three days , '' agreed Winter .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 14]: `` Then it follows -- '' began the Inspector , but checked himself .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 13]: He was becoming slightly mixed as to the exact sequence of events .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 25]: `` Come , now , Bates , '' said Furneaux , `` you can tell us the day Mr. Robert Fenley left home recently ?
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 9]: There is no harm in mentioning his name .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 20]: It ca n't help being in our thoughts , since it was discovered that his gun was missing . ''
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 16]: `` He went off on a motor bicycle last Saturday mornin ' , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 8]: `` Can you fix the hour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 7]: `` About half past ten . ''
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 9]: `` You have not seen him since ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 6]: `` No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 13]: `` You would be likely to know if he had returned ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 14]: `` Certain , sir , unless he kem by the Roxton gate . ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 9]: `` Oh , is there another entrance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 17]: `` Yes , but it ca n't be used , ` cept by people on foot .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 28]: The big gates are always locked , and the road has been grassed over , an ' not so many folk know of a right of way .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 8]: Of course , Mr. Robert knows . ''
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 4]: Bates was disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 19]: He expected to be cross-examined farther , but , to his manifest relief , the ordeal was postponed .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 14]: Winter and Furneaux commenced a careful scrutiny of the ground behind the rock .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 15]: They struck off on different paths , but came together at a little distance .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 8]: `` The trees , '' murmured Winter .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 9]: `` Yes , when we are alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 11]: `` Have you noticed -- '' `` These curious pads .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 5]: They mean a lot .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 9]: It 's not so easy , James . ''
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 10]: `` I 'm growing interested , I admit . ''
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 5]: They rejoined the others .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 20]: `` Did you tell me that only you and Police Constable Farrow visited this part of the wood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 5]: said Furneaux to Bates .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 22]: `` I do n't remember tellin ' you , sir , but that 's the fact , '' said the keeper .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 20]: `` Well , warn all the estate hands to keep away from this section during the next few days .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 13]: You will give orders to Farrow to that effect , Inspector ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 28]: If they go trampling all over , you wo n't know where you are when it comes to a close search , '' was the cheerful answer .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 16]: `` Now , about that gun -- it must be hidden somewhere in the undergrowth .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 28]: The man who fired it would never dare to carry it along an open road on a fine morning like this , when everybody is astir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 10]: `` You 're undoubtedly right , '' said Winter .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 7]: `` But here come assorted boots .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 8]: They may help us a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 7]: Tomlinson was a man of method .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 17]: He and Farrow had brought two wicker baskets , such as are used in laundry work .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 5]: He was rather breathless .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 17]: `` House -- and estate , '' he wheezed , pointing to each basket in turn .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 10]: `` Go ahead , Furneaux , '' said Winter .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 12]: `` Because I ought to stoop , I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 18]: The little man choked back some gibe ; the presence of strangers enforced respect to his chief .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 26]: He took a thin folding rule of aluminum from a waistcoat pocket , and applied it to the most clearly defined of the three footprints .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 16]: Then beginning at the `` house '' basket , he ran over the contents rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 8]: One pair of boots he set aside .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 30]: After testing the `` estate '' basket without success , he seized one of the selected pair , and pressed it into the earth close to an original print .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 13]: He looked up at Tomlinson , who was in a violent perspiration .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 7]: `` Whose boot is this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 14]: `` God help us , sir , it 's Mr. Robert 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 7]: said Tomlinson in an agonized tone .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 25]: The Inspector , Farrow and Bates were visibly thrilled ; but Furneaux only sank back on his heels , and peered at the boot .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 53]: `` I do n't understand why any one should feel upset because these footprints -LRB- which , by the way , were not made by this pair of boots -RRB- happen to resemble marks which may have been made by Mr. Robert Fenley , '' he said , apparently talking to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 10]: `` These marks are three or four days old .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 8]: Mr. Robert Fenley went away on Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 4]: Today is Wednesday .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 9]: He may have been here on Saturday morning .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 8]: What does it matter if he was ?
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 15]: The man who murdered his father must have been here two hours ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 2]: Sensation !
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 29]: Tomlinson mopped his forehead with a handkerchief already a wet rag ; Farrow , not daring to interfere , nibbled his chin strap ; Bates scowled with relief .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 11]: But the Inspector , after a husky cough , spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 17]: `` Would you mind telling me , Mr. Furneaux , why you are so sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 14]: `` Now , Professor Bates , you tell him , '' cackled Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 20]: The keeper dropped on his knees by the side of the detective , and gazed critically at the marks .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 20]: `` At this time o ' year , gentlemen , things do grow wonderful , '' he said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 25]: `` In this sort o ' ground , where there 's wet an ' shade , there 's a kind o ' constant movement .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 29]: This here new print is clean , an ' the broken grass an ' crushed leaves have n't had time to straighten themselves , as one might say .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 25]: But , in this other lot , the shoots are commencin ' to perk up , an ' insec 's have stirred the mold .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 18]: It 's just the difference atween a new run for rabbits and an old ` un . ''
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 12]: `` Thank you , Bates , '' broke in Winter sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 13]: `` Now , we must not waste any more time in demonstrations .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 16]: Mr. Furneaux explained this thing purposely , to show the folly of jumping at conclusions .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 14]: Innocent men have been hanged before today on just such evidence as this .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 18]: We should deem ourselves lucky that these footprints were found so soon after the crime was committed .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 16]: Tomorrow , or next day , there might have been a doubt in our minds .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 5]: Luckily there is none .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 30]: The man who shot Mr. Fenley this morning -- '' he paused ; Furneaux alone appreciated his difficulty -- `` could not possibly have left those marks today . ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 10]: It was a lame ending , but it sufficed .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 44]: Four of his hearers took him to mean that the unknown , whose feet had left their impress in the soil could not have been the murderer ; but Furneaux growled in French -- `` You tripped badly that time , my friend .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 6]: You need another cigar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 21]: Seemingly , he was soliloquizing , and none understood except the one person for whose benefit the sarcasm was intended .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 18]: Winter felt the spur , but because he was a really great detective it only stimulated him .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 12]: Nothing more was said until the little procession reached the avenue .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 20]: During their brief disappearance in the leafy depths two cars and three motor cycles had arrived at The Towers .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 4]: A glance sufficed .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 21]: The newspapers had heard of the murder ; this was the advance guard of an army of reporters and photographers .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 5]: Winter buttonholed the Inspector .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 20]: `` I 'll tell you the most valuable service you can render at this moment , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 14]: `` Arrange that a constable shall mount guard at the rock till nightfall .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 6]: Then place two on duty .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 26]: With four men you can provide the necessary reliefs , but I want that place watched continuously , and intruders warned off till further notice .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 13]: This man who happens to be here might go on duty immediately .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 10]: Then you can make your plans at leisure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 49]: Thus , by the quaint contriving of chance , Police Constable Farrow , whose stalwart form and stubborn zeal had blocked the path to the Quarry Wood since a few minutes after ten o'clock , was deputed to continue that particular duty till a comrade took his place .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 45]: His face fell when he heard that he was condemned to solitude , shut out from all the excitement of the hour , debarred even , as he imagined , from standing on the rock and watching the comings and goings at the mansion .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 12]: But Winter was a kindly if far-seeing student of human nature .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 23]: `` It will be a bit slow for you , '' he said , when the Inspector had given Farrow his orders .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 26]: `` But you can amuse yourself by an occasional peep at the landscape , and there is no reason why you should n't smoke . ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 3]: Farrow saluted .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 14]: `` Do you mean , sir , that I can show myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 4]: `` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 13]: The mere fact that your presence is known will warn off priers .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 31]: Remember -- no one , absolutely no one except the police , is to be allowed to pass the quarry , or approach from any side within hailing distance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 10]: `` Not even from the house , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 3]: `` Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 28]: Mr. Fenley and Miss Manning may be told , if necessary , why you are there , and I am sure they will respect my wishes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 4]: Farrow turned back .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 8]: It was not so bad , then .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 22]: These Scotland Yard fellows had chosen him for an important post , and that hint about a pipe was distinctly human .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 29]: Odd thing , too , that Mr. Robert Fenley was not expected to put in an appearance , or the Superintendent would have mentioned him with the others .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 10]: On reaching the house there were evidences of disturbance .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 20]: Hilton Fenley stood in the doorway , and was haranguing the newspaper men in a voice harsh with anger .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 9]: This intrusion was unwarranted , illegal , impudent .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 8]: He would have them expelled by force .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 28]: When he caught sight of the Inspector he demanded fiercely that names and addresses should be taken , so that his solicitors might issue summonses for trespass .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 34]: All this , of course , made excellent copy , and Winter put an end to the scene by drawing the reporters aside and giving them a fairly complete account of the murder .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 26]: Incidentally , he sent off the Inspector post haste on his bicycle to station a constable at each gate , and stop the coming invasion .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 29]: The house telephone , too , closed the main gate effectually , so when the earliest scouts had rushed away to connect with Fleet Street order was restored .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 10]: Winter was puzzled by Fenley 's display of passion .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 27]: It was only to be expected that the newspapers would break out in a rash of black headlines over the murder of a prominent London financier .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 10]: By hook or by crook , journalism would triumph .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 19]: He had often been amazed at the extent and accuracy of news items concerning the most secret inquiries .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 13]: Of course the reporters sometimes missed the heart of an intricate case .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 25]: In this instance , they had never heard of the bond robbery , though the numbers of the stolen securities had been advertised widely .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 39]: Moreover , he was free to admit that if every fact known to the police were published broadcast , no one would be a penny the worse ; for thus far the crime was singularly lacking in motive .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 9]: Meanwhile Furneaux had fastened on to Brodie again .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 8]: `` You saw me at once ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 3]: he began .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 37]: `` I could n't miss you , sir , '' said the chauffeur , a solid , stolid mechanic , who understood his engine and a road map thoroughly , and left the rest to Providence .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 20]: `` I was n't payin ' particular attention , yet I twigged you the minute you popped up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 36]: `` So it is reasonable to suppose that if any one had appeared in that same place this morning and taken steady aim at Mr. Fenley , you would have twigged him , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 10]: `` It strikes me that way , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 13]: `` Did you see nothing -- not even a puff of smoke ?
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 15]: You must certainly have looked at the wood when you heard the shot . ''
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 6]: `` I did , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 5]: Not a leaf moved .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 35]: Just a couple of pheasants flew out , and the rooks around the house kicked up such a row that I did n't know the Guv ` nor was down till Harris shouted . ''
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 9]: `` Where did the pheasants fly from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 29]: `` They kem out a bit below the rock ; but they were risin ' birds , an ' may have started from the ground higher up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 12]: `` No birds were startled before the shot was fired ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 8]: `` Not to my knowledge , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 13]: But June pheasants are very tame , and they lie marvelous close .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 11]: A pheasant would just as soon run as fly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 10]: The detectives began a detailed inquiry almost at once .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 30]: It covered the ground already traversed , and the only new incident happened when Hilton Fenley , at the moment repeating his evidence , was called to the telephone .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 22]: `` If either of you cares to smoke there are cigars and Virginia cigarettes on the sideboard , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 23]: `` Or , if you prefer Turkish , here are some , '' and he laid a gold case on the table .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 9]: Furneaux grabbed it when the door had closed .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 12]: `` All neurotics use Turkish cigarettes , '' he said solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 7]: `` Ah , I guessed it !
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 9]: A strong , vile , scented brand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 15]: `` Sometimes , my dear Charles , you talk rubbish , '' sighed Winter .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 3]: `` Maybe .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 7]: I never think or smoke it .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 14]: ` Language was given us to conceal our thoughts , ' said Talleyrand .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 24]: I have always admired Talleyrand , ` that rather middling bishop but very eminent knave , ' as de Quincey called him . '
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 4]: _ Cr√© nom !
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 12]: _ I wonder what de Quincey meant by ` middling . '
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 38]: A man who could keep in the front rank under the Bourbons , during the Revolution , with Napoleon , and back again under the Bourbons , and yet die in bed , must have been superhuman .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 18]: St. Peter , in his stead , would have lost his napper at least four times . ''
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 24]: Winter stirred uneasily , and gazed out across the Italian garden and park , for the detectives were again installed in the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 9]: `` What about that artist , Trenholme ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 6]: he said after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 7]: `` We 'll look him up .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 12]: Before leaving this house I want to peep into various rooms .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 5]: And there 's Tomlinson .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 6]: Tomlinson is a rich mine .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 6]: Do leave him to me .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 21]: I 'll dig into him deep , and extract ore of high percentage -- see if I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 24]: `` Do you know , Charles , I 've a notion that we shall get closer to bed-rock in London than here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 16]: Furneaux pretended to look for an invisible halo surrounding his chief 's close-cropped bullet head .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 22]: `` Sometimes , '' he said reverently , `` you frighten me when you bring off a brilliant remark like that .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 12]: I seem to see lightning zigzagging round Jove 's dome . ''
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 3]: Fenley returned .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 13]: `` It was a call from the bank , '' he announced .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 8]: `` They have just seen the newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 13]: I told them I would run up to town this afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 11]: `` Then you did not telephone Bishopsgate Street earlier ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 9]: inquired Winter , permitting himself to be surprised .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 9]: I had other things to bother me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 16]: `` Now , Mr. Fenley , can you tell me where your brother is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 6]: `` I can not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 10]: He placed a rather unnecessary emphasis on the negative .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 7]: The question seemed to disturb him .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 19]: Evidently , if he could consult his own wishes , he would prefer not to discuss his brother .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 16]: `` I take it he has not been home since leaving here on Saturday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 3]: persisted Winter .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 6]: `` That is so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 9]: `` Had he quarreled with your father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 6]: `` There was a dispute .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 15]: Really , Mr. Winter , I must decline to go into family affairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 20]: `` But the probability is that the more we know the less our knowledge will affect your brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 5]: The door opened again .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 8]: Mr. Winter was wanted on the telephone .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 45]: Then there happened one of those strange coincidences which Furneaux 's caustic wit had christened `` Winter 's Yorkers , '' being a quaint play on the lines : Now is the Winter of our discontent Made glorious Summer by this sun of York .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 38]: For the Superintendent had scarcely squeezed his big body into the telephone box when he became aware of a mixup on the line ; a querulous voice was saying : `` I insist on being put through .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 20]: I am speaking from Mr. Fenley 's bank , and it is monstrous that I should be kept waiting .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 11]: I 've been trying for twenty minutes -- '' Buzz .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 5]: The protest was squelched .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 6]: `` Are you there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 9]: came the calm accents of the Assistant Commissioner .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 9]: `` Yes , sir , '' said Winter .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 5]: `` Any progress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 4]: `` A little .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 14]: Oddly enough , you are in the nick of time to help materially .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 19]: Will you ring off , and find out from the exchange who ` phoned here two minutes ago ?
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 16]: I do n't mean Fenley 's Bank , which is just trying to get through .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 15]: I want to know who made the preceding call , which was effective . ''
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 4]: `` I understand .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 3]: Good-by . ''
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 14]: Winter explained in the dining-room that the Assistant Commissioner was anxious for news .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 9]: He had hardly finished when the footman reappeared .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 7]: A call for Mr. Hilton Fenley .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 9]: `` Confound the telephone , '' snapped Fenley .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 16]: `` We wo n't have a moment 's peace all day , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 6]: Winter winked heavily at Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 16]: He waited until Fenley 's hurried footsteps across a creaking parquet floor had died away .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 12]: `` This is the bank 's call , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 10]: `` The other was from the Lord knows who .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 9]: I 've put the Yard on the track .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 9]: I wonder why he lied about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 15]: `` He 's a queer sort of brother , too , '' said Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 14]: `` It strikes me he wants to put Robert in the cart . ''
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 12]: CHAPTER V A FAMILY GATHERING Fenley was frowning when he reappeared .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 12]: `` Another call from the Bank , '' he said gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 17]: `` Everything there is at sixes and sevens since the news was howled through the City .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 11]: That is why I really must go to town later .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 6]: I 'm not altogether sorry .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 32]: The necessity of bringing my mind to bear on business will leaven the surfeit of horrors I 've borne this morning ... `` Now , about my brother , Mr. Winter .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 26]: While listening to Mr. Brown 's condolences -- you remember Brown , the cashier , Mr. Furneaux -- I was thinking of more vital matters .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 31]: A policy of concealment often defeats its own object , and I have come to the conclusion that you ought to know of a dispute between my father and Robert .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 11]: There 's a woman in the case , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 9]: It 's a rather unpleasant story , too .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 12]: Poor Bob got entangled with a married woman some months ago .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 23]: He was infatuated at first , but would have broken it off recently were it not for fear of divorce proceedings . ''
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 13]: `` Would you make the position a little clearer , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 10]: said Winter , who also was listening and thinking .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 30]: He was quite certain that when he met Mr. Brown he would meet the man who had been worrying a telephone exchange `` during the last twenty minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 8]: `` I -- I ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 14]: And Fenley 's hand brushed away some imaginary film from before his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 11]: `` Bob and I never hit it off very well .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 10]: We 're only half brothers , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 8]: `` Was your father married twice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 10]: `` Am I to reopen a forgotten history ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 14]: `` Some person , or persons , may not have forgotten it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 14]: `` Well , you must have the full story , if at all .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 8]: My father was not a well-born man .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 39]: Thirty years ago he was a trainer in the service of a rich East Indian merchant , Anthony Drummond , of Calcutta , who owned racehorses , and one of Drummond 's daughters fell in love with him .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 14]: They ran away and got married , but the marriage was a failure .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 11]: She divorced him -- by mutual consent , I fancy .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 11]: Anyhow , _ I _ was left on his hands .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 28]: `` He went to Assam , and fell in with a tea planter named Manning , who had a big estate , but neglected it for racing .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 13]: My father suddenly developed business instincts and Manning made him a partner .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 33]: Unfortunately -- well , that is a hard word , but it applies -- my father married again -- a girl of his own class ; rather beneath it , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 5]: Then Bob was born .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 11]: `` The old man made money , heaps of it .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 14]: Manning married , but lost his wife when Sylvia came into the world .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 22]: That broke him up ; he drank himself to death , leaving his partner as trustee and guardian for the infant .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 22]: There was a boom in tea estates ; my father sold on the crest of the wave and came to London .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 10]: He progressed , but Mrs. Fenley -- did n't .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 24]: She was just a Tommy 's daughter , and never seemed to try and rise above the level of ` married quarters ' .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 20]: `` I had to mind my p 's and q 's as a boy , I can assure you .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 9]: My mother was always thrown in my teeth .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 8]: Mrs. Fenley called her ` black . '
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 6]: It was a -- lie .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 20]: She was dark-skinned , as I am , but there are Cornish and Welsh folk of much darker complexion .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 12]: My father , too , shared something of the same prejudice .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 11]: I had to be the good boy of the family .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 13]: Otherwise , I should have been turned out , neck and crop .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 32]: `` As I behaved well , he was forced to depend on me , because Bob did as he liked , with his mother always ready to aid and abet him .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 9]: Then came this scrape I 've spoken of .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 7]: I believe Bob was being blackmailed .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 10]: That 's the long and the short of it .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 9]: Now you know the plain , ungarbled facts .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 21]: Better that they should come from me than reach you with the decorations of gossip and servants ' tittle-tattle . ''
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 8]: The somewhat strained and metallic voice ceased .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 13]: Fenley was seated at the corner of the table near the door .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 27]: Seemingly yielding to that ever-present desire for movement , he pushed with his foot an armchair out of its place at the head of the table .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 19]: Sylvia Manning had pointed out that chair to Furneaux as the one occupied by Mortimer Fenley at breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 9]: `` Is the first Mrs. Fenley dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 4]: said Furneaux suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 15]: `` I do n't think so , '' said Fenley , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 7]: `` You are not sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 10]: `` Have you ever tried to find out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 8]: `` No , I dare not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 7]: `` May I ask why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 25]: `` If it were discovered that my mother and I were in communication I would have been given short shrift in the bank . ''
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 7]: `` Did she marry again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 5]: Again there was silence .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 19]: Furneaux seemed to be satisfied that he was following a blind alley , and Winter became the inquisitor .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 17]: `` What is the name of the woman with whom your brother is mixed up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 13]: `` I can not tell you , but my father knew . ''
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 10]: `` What leads you to form that opinion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 14]: `` Some words that passed between Bob and him last Saturday morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 3]: `` Where ?
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 3]: Here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 7]: `` Yes , in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 31]: Tomlinson heard more distinctly than I. I saw there was trouble brewing , and kept out of it -- hung back , on the pretense of reading a newspaper . ''
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 14]: `` As to the missing rifle -- can you help us there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 6]: `` Not in the least .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 15]: I wish to Heaven Bob had gone to Africa , as he was planning .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 10]: Then all this misery would have been avoided . ''
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 10]: `` Do you mean your father 's death ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 3]: Fenley started .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 7]: He had not weighed his words .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 8]: `` Oh , no , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 4]: he cried hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 13]: `` Do n't try to trip me into admissions , Mr. Winter .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 12]: I ca n't stand that , damned if I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 29]: He jumped up , went to the sideboard and mixed himself a weak brandy and soda , which he swallowed as if his throat were afire with thirst .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 18]: `` I am not treating you as a hostile witness , sir , '' answered Winter calmly .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 11]: `` Mr. Furneaux and I are merely clearing the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 21]: Soon we shall know , or believe that we know , what line to avoid and what to follow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 11]: `` Is Miss Sylvia Manning engaged to be married ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 4]: put in Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 7]: Fenley gave him a fiendish look .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 18]: `` What the devil has Miss Manning 's matrimonial prospects got to do with this inquiry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 21]: he said , and the venom in his tone was hardly to be accounted for by Furneaux 's harmless-sounding query .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 19]: `` One never knows , '' said the little man , taking the unexpected attack with bland indifference .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 11]: `` You do n't appreciate our position in this matter .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 8]: We are not judges , but guessers .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 40]: We sit in the stalls of a theater , watching people on the stage of real life playing four acts of a tragedy , and it is our business to construct the fifth , which is produced in court .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 14]: Let me give you a wildly supposititious version of that fifth act now .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 23]: Suppose some neurotic fool was in love with Miss Manning , or her money , and Mr. Mortimer Fenley opposed the project .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 9]: That would supply a motive for the murder .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 7]: Do you take the point ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 10]: `` I 'm sorry I blazed out at you .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 19]: Miss Manning is not engaged to be married , nor likely to be for many a day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 19]: Now , the obvious question was , `` Why , she being such an attractive young lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 7]: But Furneaux never put obvious questions .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 16]: He turned to Winter with the air of one who had nothing more to say .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 27]: His colleague was evidently perplexed , and showed it , but extricated the others from an awkward situation with the tact for which he was noted .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 28]: `` I am much obliged to you for your candor in supplying such a clear summary of the family history , Mr. Fenley , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 26]: `` Of course , we shall be meeting you frequently during the next few days , and developments can be discussed as they arise . ''
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 24]: His manner , more than his words , conveyed an intimation that when the opportunity served he would trounce Furneaux for an indiscretion .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 4]: Fenley was mollified .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 11]: `` Command me in every way , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 18]: `` There is one more question , the last and the gravest , '' said Winter seriously .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 12]: `` Do you suspect any one of committing this murder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 9]: On my soul and honor , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 6]: `` Thank you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 12]: We 'll tackle the butler now , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 10]: `` I 'll send him , '' said Fenley .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 23]: Probably in nervous forgetfulness , he lighted a cigarette and went out , blowing two long columns of smoke through his nostrils .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 18]: He might , or might not , have been pleased had he heard the reprimanding of Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 15]: `` Good stroke , that about the stage , Charles , '' mumbled Winter .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 11]: Furneaux threw out his hands with a gesture of disgust .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 9]: `` What an actor the man is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 19]: he almost hissed , owing to the need there was of subduing his piping voice to a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 14]: `` Every word thought out , but allowed to be dragged forth reluctantly .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 11]: Putting brother Bob into the tureen , is n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 10]: ` On my soul and honor , ' too !
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 21]: Do n't you remember , some French blighter said that when an innocent man was being made a political scapegoat ?
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 16]: ... Of course , the mother is a Eurasian , and he has met her .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 7]: A nice dish he served up !
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 13]: A salad of easily ascertainable facts with a dressing of lying innuendo .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 5]: Name of a pipe !
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 19]: If Master Hilton had n't been in the house -- '' A knock , and the door opened .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 19]: `` You want me , gentlemen , I am informed by Mr. Hilton Fenley , '' said Tomlinson .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 13]: There spoke the butler , discreet , precise , incapable of error .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 9]: Tomlinson had recovered his breath and his dignity .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 7]: He was in his own domain .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 11]: The very sight of the Mid-Victorian furniture gave him confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 12]: His skilled glance traveled to the decanter and the empty glass .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 18]: He knew to a minim how much brandy had evaporated since his last survey of the sideboard .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 11]: `` Sit down , Tomlinson , '' said Winter pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 14]: `` You must have been dreadfully shocked by this morning 's occurrence . ''
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 4]: Tomlinson sat down .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 25]: He drew the chair somewhat apart from the table , knowing better than to place his elbows on that sacred spread of polished mahogany .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 10]: `` I was , sir , '' he admitted .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 18]: `` Indeed , I may say I shall always be shocked by the remembrance of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 10]: `` Mr. Mortimer Fenley was a kindly employer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 8]: `` One of the best , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 29]: He liked things done just so , and could be sharp if there was any laxity , but I have never received a cross word from him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 6]: `` Known him long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 14]: `` Ever since he come to The Towers ; nearly twenty years . ''
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 6]: `` And Mrs. Fenley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 13]: `` Mrs. Fenley leaves the household entirely under my control , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 5]: She never interferes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 7]: `` She is an invalid . ''
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 13]: `` Is she so ill that she can not be seen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 7]: `` Practically that , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 8]: `` Been so for twenty years ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 3]: Tomlinson coughed .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 36]: He was prepared with an ample statement as to the catastrophe which took place at nine thirty A. M. , but this delving into bygone decades was unexpected and decidedly distasteful , it would seem .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 29]: `` Mrs. Fenley is unhappily addicted to the drug habit , sir , '' he said severely , plainly hinting that there were bounds , even for detectives .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 11]: `` I fancied so , '' was the dry response .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 17]: `` However , I can understand and honor your reluctance to reveal Mrs. Fenley 's failings .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 24]: Now , please tell us exactly what Mr. Fenley and Mr. Robert said to each other in the hall last Saturday morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 23]: How poor Farrow , immured in his jungle , would have gloated over Tomlinson 's collapse when he heard those fatal words !
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 25]: To his credit be it said , the butler had not breathed a word to a soul concerning the scene between father and son .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 21]: He knew nothing of an inquisitive housemaid , and his tortured brain fastened on Hilton Fenley as the Paul Pry .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 13]: Unconsciously , he felt bitter against his new master from that moment .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 12]: `` Must I go into these delicate matters , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 3]: he bleated .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 4]: `` Most certainly .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 31]: The man whom you respected so greatly has been killed , not in the course of a heated dispute , but as the outcome of a brutal and well-conceived plan .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 22]: Bear that in mind , and you will see that concealment of vital facts is not only unwise but disloyal . ''
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 9]: Winter rather let himself go in his earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 18]: He flushed slightly , and dared not look at Furneaux lest he should encounter an admiring glance .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 21]: The butler , however , was far too worried to pay heed to his questioner 's florid turn of speech .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 4]: He sighed deeply .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 24]: He felt like a timid swimmer in a choppy sea , knowing he was out of his depth yet compelled to struggle blindly .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 19]: So , with broken utterance , he repeated the words which a rabbit-eared housemaid had carried to Bates .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 25]: Nevertheless , even while he labored on , he fancied that the detectives did not attach such weight to the recital as he feared .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 20]: He anticipated that Winter would write each syllable in a notebook , and show an exceeding gravity of appreciation .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 11]: To his great relief , nothing of the kind happened .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 7]: Winter 's comment was distinctly helpful .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 21]: `` It must have been rather disconcerting for you to hear father and son quarreling openly , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 9]: `` Sir , it was most unpleasant . ''
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 16]: `` Now , did you form any opinion as to the cause of this bickering ?
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 22]: For instance , did you imagine that Mr. Fenley wished his son to break off relations with an undesirable acquaintance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 7]: `` I did , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 13]: `` Is either Mr. Hilton or Mr. Robert engaged to be married ?
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 24]: Or , I had better put it , had their father expressed any views as to either of his sons marrying suitably ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 25]: `` We , in the house , sir , had a notion that Mr. Fenley would like Mr. Robert to marry Miss Sylvia . ''
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 3]: `` Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 4]: I expected that .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 13]: Were these two young people of the same way of thinking ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 14]: `` They were friendly , sir , but more like brother and sister .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 8]: You see , they were reared together .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 22]: It often happens that way when a young gentleman and young lady grow up from childhood in each other 's company .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 31]: They never think of marriage , whereas the same young gentleman would probably fall head over heels in love with the same young lady if he met her elsewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 4]: `` Good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 4]: broke in Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 9]: `` Tomlinson , do you drink port ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 19]: The butler looked his astonishment , but answered readily enough -- `` My favorite wine , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 5]: `` I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 9]: Taken in moderation , port induces sound reasoning .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 9]: I have some Alto Douro of ' 61 .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 8]: I 'll bring you a bottle . ''
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 15]: Tomlinson was mystified , a trifle scandalized perhaps ; but he bowed his acknowledgments .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 10]: `` Sir , I will appreciate it greatly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 6]: `` I know you will .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 13]: My Alto Douro goes down no gullet but a connoisseur 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 8]: Even in his agitation , Tomlinson smiled .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 21]: What a queer little man this undersized detective was , to be sure , and how oddly he expressed himself !
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 29]: `` I ask this just as a matter of form , but did Mr. Robert Fenley take his .450 Express rifle when he went away on Saturday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 3]: said Winter .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 10]: He had only a valise strapped to the carrier .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 26]: But I do happen to know that the gun was in his room on Friday , because Friday is my day for house inspection . ''
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 5]: `` Any cartridges ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 8]: `` I ca n't say , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 18]: They would be in a drawer , or , more likely , in the gun room . ''
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 8]: `` Where is this gun room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 19]: `` Next to the harness room , sir -- second door to the right in the courtyard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 17]: `` Speaking absolutely in confidence , have you formed a theory as to this murder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 18]: But if any sort of evidence is piled up against Mr. Robert I shall not credit it .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 18]: No power on earth could make me believe that he would kill his father in cold blood .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 7]: He respected his father , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 26]: He 's a bit wild , as young men with too much money are apt to be , but he was good-hearted and genuine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 18]: `` Yet he did speak of blowing his own brains out , and his father 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 11]: `` That was his silly way of talking , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 28]: He would say , ` Tomlinson , if you tell the pater what time I came home last night I 'll stab you to the heart . '
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 23]: When there was a bit of a family squabble he would threaten to mix a gallon of weed-killer and drink every drop .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 11]: Everything was rotten , or beastly , or awfully ripping .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 34]: He was not so well educated as he ought to have been -- Mrs. Fenley 's fault entirely ; and he had n't the -- the words -- '' `` The vocabulary . ''
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 7]: `` That 's it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 6]: I see you understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 30]: `` Tomlinson , '' interrupted Furneaux , `` a famous American writer , Oliver Wendell Holmes , described adjectives of that class as the blank checks of intellectual bankruptcy .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 10]: You have hit on the same great thought . ''
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 5]: The butler smiled again .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 7]: He was beginning to like Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 18]: `` You have never heard , I suppose , of Mr. Fenley receiving any threatening letters ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 3]: continued Winter .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 31]: Some stupid postcards were sent when he tried to close a right of way through the park ; but they were merely ridiculous , and that occurred years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 22]: `` So you , like the rest of us , feel utterly unable to assign a motive for this crime ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 14]: `` Sir , it 's like a thunderbolt from a clear sky . ''
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 17]: `` Were the brothers , or half brothers , on good terms with each other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 12]: Tomlinson started at those words , `` or half brothers . ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 15]: He was not prepared for the Superintendent 's close acquaintance with the Fenley records .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 24]: `` They 're as different as chalk and cheese , sir , '' he said , after a pause to collect his wits .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 23]: `` Mr. Hilton is clever and well read , and cares nothing about sport , though he has a wonderful steady nerve .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 18]: Yes , I mean that -- '' for Winter 's prominent eyes showed surprise at the statement .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 11]: `` He 's a strange mixture , is Mr. Hilton .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 9]: He 's a fair nailer with a revolver .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 33]: I 've seen him hit a penny three times straight off at twelve paces , and , when in the mind , he would bowl over running rabbits with a rook rifle .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 10]: Yet he never joined the shooting parties in October .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 14]: Said it made him ill to see graceful birds shattered by clumsy folk .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 12]: All the same , he would ill-treat a horse something shameful .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 15]: I -- '' The butler bethought himself , and pulled up with a jerk .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 5]: But Winter smiled encouragingly .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 12]: `` Say what you had in mind , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 7]: `` You are not giving evidence .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 8]: You may rely on our discretion . ''
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 43]: `` Well , sir , he 's that sort of man who must have his own way , and when things went against him at home , he 'd take it out of any servant or animal that vexed him afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 14]: `` It was not an ideally happy household , I take it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 13]: `` Things went along very smoothly , sir , all things considered .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 13]: They have been rather better since Miss Sylvia came home from Brussels .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 33]: She was worried about Mrs. Fenley at first , but gave it up as a bad job ; and Mr. Fenley and the young gentlemen used to hide their differences before her .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 16]: That was why Mr. Fenley and Mr. Robert blazed up in the hall on Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 17]: They could n't say a word in front of Miss Sylvia at the breakfast table . ''
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 11]: `` The four always met at breakfast , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 7]: `` Almost without fail , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 40]: On Monday and Tuesday mornings Mr. Hilton breakfasted early , and his father was joking about it , for if any one was late it would be him -- or should I say ` he ' , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 3]: Furneaux cackled .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 17]: `` I would n't have you alter your speech on any account , '' he grinned .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 16]: `` Why did Mr. Hilton turn over these new leaves on Monday and Tuesday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 9]: `` He said he had work to do .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 10]: What it was I do n't know , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 17]: But he managed to miss the nine forty-five , and Mr. Fenley was vexed about it .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 16]: Of course , I do n't know why I am telling you these small things .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 11]: Mr. Hilton might be angry -- '' Some one knocked .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 14]: Harris , the footman , entered , a scared look on his face .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 11]: `` Can you come a moment , Mr. Tomlinson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 10]: `` The undertaker is here for the body . ''
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 6]: `` What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 4]: cried Winter sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 4]: The butler arose .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 11]: `` Did n't Mr. Hilton mention it , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 32]: `` Dr. Stern must hold a post mortem before the inquest , and he suggested that it could be carried through more easily in the mortuary attached to the Cottage Hospital .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 9]: Is n't that all right , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes , I 'm sorry .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 5]: I did n't understand .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 6]: Go , by all means .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 6]: We 'll wait here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 15]: When they were alone , the two detectives remained silent for a long minute .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 12]: Winter arose and looked through a window at the scene outside .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 18]: A closed hearse had arrived ; some men were carrying in a rough coffin and three trestles .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 16]: There was none of the gorgeous trappings which lend dignity to such transits in public .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 21]: Polished oak and gleaming brass and rare flowers would add pageantry later ; this was the livery of the dissecting-room .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 5]: `` Queer case ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 6]: growled Winter over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 13]: `` If only Hilton had breakfasted early _ this _ morning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 3]: said Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 23]: `` If the dog had n't stopped to scratch himself he would have caught the hare , '' was the irritable answer .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 11]: `` Are n't you pleased with Tomlinson , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 12]: `` The more he opened up the more puzzled I became .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 21]: By the way , you hardly asked him a thing , though you were keen on tackling him yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 8]: `` James , I 'm an artist .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 12]: You handled him so neatly that I stood by and appreciated .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 19]: It would be mean to suggest that the prospect of a bottle of Alto Douro quickened his imagination .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 20]: I -- '' Winter 's hands were crossed behind his back , and his fingers worked in expressive pantomime .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 9]: Furneaux was by his side in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 19]: Hilton Fenley was standing on the steps , a little below and to the left of the window .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 24]: He was gazing with a curiously set stare at the bust of Police Constable Farrow perched high among the trees to the right .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 16]: The observers in the room had then an excellent opportunity to study him at leisure .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 17]: `` More of Asia than of Europe in that face and figure , '' murmured Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 28]: `` The odd thing is that he should be more interested in our sentinel than in the disposal of his father 's body , '' commented Winter .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 14]: `` A live donkey is always more valuable than a dead lion . ''
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 14]: `` We shall have to go to that wood soon , Charles . ''
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 17]: `` Your only failing is that you ca n't see the forest for the trees . ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 13]: They were bickering , an ominous sign for some one yet unknown .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 15]: Suddenly , far down the avenue , they saw a motor bicycle traveling fast .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 30]: Hilton Fenley saw it at the same moment and screened his eyes with a hand , for he was bareheaded and the sun was now blazing with noonday intensity .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 5]: `` Brother Bob ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 3]: hissed Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 13]: Winter thought the other had recognized the man crouched over the handlebar .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 4]: `` Gee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 8]: `` Your sight must be good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 10]: `` I 'm not using eyes , but brains .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 6]: Who else can it be ?
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 9]: This is the psychological moment which never fails .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 10]: Bet you a new hat I 'm right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 14]: `` I 'm not buying you any new hats , '' said Winter .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 5]: `` Look at Hilton .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 3]: He knows .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 10]: Now , I wonder if the other one telephoned .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 6]: He 'd have told us .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 14]: He 'd guess it would crop up in talk some time or other .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 9]: Yes , the motorist is waving to him .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 6]: You can see his face .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 11]: It _ is _ Robert , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 6]: `` O sapient one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 3]: snapped Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 12]: The meeting between the brothers was orthodox in its tragic friendliness .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 12]: The onlookers could supply the words they were unable to hear .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 64]: Robert Fenley , bigger , heavier , altogether more British in build and semblance than Hilton , was evidently asking breathlessly if the news he had read in London was true , and Hilton was volubly explaining what had happened , pointing to the wood , the doorway , the hearse , emphasizing with many gestures the painful story he had to tell .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 27]: Then the two young men mounted the steps , the inference being that Robert Fenley wished to see his father 's body before it was removed .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 15]: A pallor was spreading beneath the glow on the younger Fenley 's perspiring face .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 7]: He was obviously shocked beyond measure .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 13]: Grief and horror had imparted a certain strength to somewhat sullen features .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 46]: He might be a ne'er - do-well , a loose liver , a good deal of a fool , perhaps , but he was learning one of life 's sharpest lessons ; in time , it might bring out what was best in his character .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 29]: The detectives understood now why the butler , who knew the boy even better than his own father , deemed it impossible that he should be a parricide .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 10]: Some men are constitutionally incapable of committing certain crimes .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 21]: At least , the public thinks so ; Scotland Yard knows better , and studies criminology with an open mind .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 20]: The brothers had hardly crossed the threshold of the house when an eldritch scream rang through the lofty hall .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 26]: The detectives hastened from the dining-room , and forthwith witnessed a tableau which would have received the envious approval of a skilled producer of melodrama .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 21]: The hall measured some thirty-five feet square , and was nearly as lofty , its ceiling forming the second floor .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 39]: The staircase was on the right , starting from curved steps in the inner right angle and making a complete turn from a half landing to reach a gallery which ran around three sides of the first floor .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 17]: The fourth contained the doorway , with a window on each hand and four windows above .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 34]: The stairs and the well of the hall were of oak , polished as to parquet and steps , but left to age and color naturally as to wainscot , balusters and rails .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 16]: The walls of the upper floor were decorated in shades of dull gold and amber .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 26]: The general effect was superb , either in daylight or when a great Venetian luster in the center of the ceiling blazed with electric lights .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 30]: The body of the unfortunate banker had not been removed from the oaken settee at the back of the hall , and was still covered with a white sheet .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 38]: An enormously stout woman , clothed in a dressing-gown of black lace , was standing in the cross gallery and resisting the gentle efforts of Sylvia Manning , now attired in black , to take her away .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 23]: The stout woman 's face was deathly white , and her distended eyes were gazing dully at the ominous figure stretched beneath .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 37]: Two podgy hands , with rings gleaming on every finger , were clutching the carved railing , and the tenacity of their grip caused the knuckles to stand out in white spots on the ivory-tinted skin .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 36]: This , then , was Mrs. Fenley , in whom some vague stirring of the spirit had induced a consciousness that all was not well in the household with which she `` never interfered . ''
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 34]: It was she who had uttered that ringing shriek when some flustered maid blurted out that `` the master '' was dead , and her dazed brain had realized what the sheet covered .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 16]: She lifted her eyes from that terrifying object when her son entered with Hilton Fenley .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 6]: `` Oh , Bob ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 3]: she wailed .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 7]: `` They 've killed your father !
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 9]: Why did you let them do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 26]: Even in the agony of the moment the distraught young man was aware that his mother was in no fit state to appear thus openly .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 19]: `` Mother , '' he said roughly , `` you ought n't to be here , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 8]: Do go to your room with Sylvia .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 10]: I 'll come soon , and explain everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 4]: `` Explain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 3]: she wailed .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 7]: `` Explain your father 's death !
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 4]: Who killed him ?
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 13]: Tell me that , and I 'll tear them with my nails .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 5]: But is he dead ?
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 7]: Did that hussy lie to me ?
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 13]: You all tell me lies because you think I am a fool .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 6]: Let me alone , Sylvia .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 9]: I _ will _ go to my husband .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 11]: Let me alone , or I 'll strike you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 19]: By sheer weight she forced herself free from the girl 's hands , and tottered down the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 18]: At the half landing she fell to her knees , and Sylvia ran to pick her up .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 11]: Then Hilton Fenley seemed to arouse himself from a stupor .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 40]: Flinging a command at the servants , he rushed to Sylvia 's assistance , and , helped by Tomlinson and a couple of footmen , half carried the screaming and fighting woman up the stairs and along a corridor .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 19]: Thus it happened that Robert Fenley was left in the hall with the dead body of his father .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 25]: He stood stock still , and seemed to follow with disapproval the manner of the disappearance of the poor creature whom he called mother .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 37]: Her shrieks redoubled in volume as she understood that she would not be allowed to see her husband 's corpse , and her son added to the uproar by shouting loudly : `` Hi , there !
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 14]: Do n't ill-treat her , or I 'll break all your -- necks !
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 9]: Confound you , be gentle with her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 38]: He listened till a door slammed , and a sudden cessation of the tumult showed that some one , in sheer self-defense , had given her morphia , the only sedative that could have any real effect .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 15]: Then he turned , and became aware of the presence of the two detectives .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 22]: `` Well , '' he said furiously , `` who are you , and what the blazes do you want here ?
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 16]: Get out , both of you , or I 'll have you chucked out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 37]: CHAPTER VI WHEREIN FURNEAUX SEEKS INSPIRATION FROM LITERATURE AND ART The head of the Criminal Investigation Department was not the sort of man to accept meekly whatsoever coarse commands Robert Fenley chose to fling at him .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 14]: He met the newcomer 's angry stare with a cold and steady eye .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 19]: `` You should moderate your language in the presence of death , Mr. Fenley , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 10]: `` We are here because it is our duty .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 35]: You , on your part , would have acted more discreetly had you gone to your mother 's assistance instead of swearing at those who were acting for the best under trying conditions . ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 12]: `` Damn your eyes , are you speaking to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 5]: came the wrathful cry .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 15]: `` Surely you have been told that your father is lying there dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 5]: went on Winter sternly .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 28]: `` Mrs. Fenley might have yielded readily to your persuasion , but your help took the form of threatening people who adopted the only other course possible .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 22]: Calm yourself , sir , and try to remember that the father from whom you parted in anger has been murdered .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 16]: My colleague and I represent Scotland Yard ; we were brought here by your brother .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 15]: See that you meet us in the dining-room in a quarter of an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 5]: Come , Furneaux ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 43]: And , stirred for once to a feeling of deep annoyance , the big man strode out into the open air , with a sublime disregard for either the anger or the alarm struggling for mastery in Robert Fenley 's sullen face .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 4]: `` Phew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 12]: he said , drawing a deep breath before descending the steps .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 6]: `` What an unlicked cub !
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 11]: And they wanted to marry that girl to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 14]: `` It sha 'n' t be done , James , '' said Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 12]: `` I actually lost my temper , '' puffed the other .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 5]: `` Tell you what !
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 9]: Let 's put the Inspector on to him .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 20]: Tell the local sleuths half what we know , and they 'll run him in like a shot . ''
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 3]: `` Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 5]: He 's all talk .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 4]: Tomlinson is right .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 21]: The neurotic Hilton has more nerve in his little finger than that dolt in the whole of his body . ''
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 10]: `` What did you think of his boots ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 15]: `` I shall be surprised if they do n't fit those footprints exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 4]: `` They will .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 16]: The left heel is evenly worn , but the right bears on the outer edge .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 20]: Let 's cool our fevered brows under the greenwood tree till this hearse is out of the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 37]: The butler , who had asked the undertaker 's assistants to suspend operations when Robert Fenley arrived , now appeared at the door and signaled the men that they were free to proceed with their work .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 31]: The detectives strolled into the wood , and soon were bending over some curious blotchy marks which somehow suggested the passage of a pad-footed animal rather than a human being .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 36]: Bates , of course , would have noted them had he not been on the alert for footprints alone , but they had stared at Winter and Furneaux from the instant their regularity became apparent .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 31]: They represented a stride considerably shorter than the average length of a man 's pace , and were strongly marked when the surface was spongy enough to receive an impression .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 24]: Except , however , in the slight hollow already described , the ground was so dry that traces of every sort were lost .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 29]: In the vicinity of the rock , too , the only marks left were the scratches in the moss adhering to the steep sides of the bowlder itself .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 11]: `` What do you make of 'em , Charles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 15]: inquired Winter , when both had puzzled for some minutes over the uncommon signs .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 18]: `` Some one has thought out the footprint as a clue pretty thoroughly , '' said Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 51]: `` He not only took care to leave a working model of one set , but was extremely anxious not to provide any data as to his own tootsies , so he fastened a bundle of rags under each boot , and walked like a cat on walnut shells . ''
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 3]: Winter nodded .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 31]: `` When we find the gun , too -- it 's somewhere in this wood -- you 'll see that the fingerprints wo n't help , '' he replied thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 15]: `` The man who remembered to safeguard his feet would not forget his hands .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 12]: We 're up against a tough proposition , young fellow-me-lad . ''
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 25]: `` Your way of thinking reminds me of Herbert Spencer 's reason for not learning Latin grammar as a youth , '' grinned Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 21]: `` It would be a pity to spoil one of your high-class jokes ; so what was the reason ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 11]: `` He refused to accept any statement unaccompanied by proof .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 22]: The agreement of an adjective with its noun displeased him , because an arbitrary rule merely said it was so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 20]: `` An ingenious excuse for not learning a lesson , but I do n't see -- '' `` Consider .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 28]: Mortimer Fenley was shot dead at nine thirty this morning , and the bullet which killed him came from the neighborhood of the rock above our heads .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 5]: One shot was fired .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 27]: It was so certain , so true of aim , that the murderer made sure of hitting him -- at a fairly long range , too .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 18]: How many men were there in Roxton and Easton this morning -- was there even one woman ?
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 13]: -- capable of sighting a rifle with such calm confidence of success ?
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 10]: Mind you , Fenley had to be killed dead .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 3]: No bungling .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 16]: A severe wound from which he might recover would not meet the case at all .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 24]: Again , how many rifles are there in the united parishes of Roxton and Easton of the type which fires expanding bullets ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 22]: `` Of course , those vital facts narrow down the field , but Hilton Fenley was unquestionably in the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 4]: Furneaux cackled shrilly .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 22]: `` You 're in Herbert 's class , Charles , '' he cried , delighted at having trapped his big friend .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 38]: `` Pardon me , gentlemen , '' said a voice from among the leaves , `` but I thought you might like to know that Mr. Robert Fenley is starting off again on his motor bike . ''
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 30]: Even as Police Constable Farrow spoke they heard the loud snorting of an exhaust , marking the initial efforts of a motor bicycle 's engine to get under way .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 26]: In a few seconds came the rhythmic beat of the machine as it gathered speed ; the two men looked at each other and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 15]: `` Master Robert defies the majesty of the law , '' said Winter dryly .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 20]: `` Perhaps , taking one consideration with another , it 's the best thing he could have done . ''
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 18]: `` He is almost bound to enter London by the Edgware Road , '' said Furneaux instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 4]: `` Just so .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 10]: I noticed the make and number of his machine .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 15]: A plain-clothes man on an ordinary bicycle can follow him easily from Brondesbury onwards .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 15]: Time him , and get on the telephone while I keep Hilton in talk .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 12]: If we 're mistaken we 'll ring up Brondesbury again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 15]: Winter was curtly official in tone when Hilton Fenley came downstairs at his request .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 14]: `` Why did your brother rush off in such an extraordinary hurry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 8]: `` How can I tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 16]: was the reply , given offhandedly , as if the matter was of no importance .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 15]: `` He comes and goes without consulting my wishes , I assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 14]: `` But I requested him to meet me here at this very hour .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 25]: There are questions he has to answer , and it would have been best in his own interests had he not shirked them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 7]: `` I agree with you fully .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 27]: I had n't the least notion he meant going until I looked out on hearing the bicycle , and saw him racing down the avenue . ''
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 14]: `` Do you think , sir , he is making for London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 5]: `` I suppose so .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 7]: That is where he came from .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 35]: He says he heard of his father 's death through the newspapers , and it would not surprise me in the least if I did not see him again until after the funeral . ''
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 6]: `` Thank you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 19]: I 'm sorry I bothered you , but I imagined or hoped he had given you some explanation .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 7]: His conduct calls for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 10]: The Superintendent 's manner had gradually become more suave .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 9]: He realized that these Fenleys were queer folk .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 36]: Like the Pharisee , `` they were not as other men , '' but whether the difference between them and the ordinary mortal arose from pride or folly or fear it was hard to say .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 5]: Hilton Fenley smiled wanly .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 17]: `` Bob is adopting the supposed tactics of the ostrich when pursued , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 9]: `` But no one is pursuing him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 9]: `` I am speaking metaphorically , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 12]: He is in distress , and hides behind the first bush .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 9]: He has no moral force -- never had .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 21]: Physically he does n't know what fear is , but the specters of the mind loom large in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 16]: And now , Superintendent , I am just on the point of leaving for London .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 7]: I shall return about six thirty .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 5]: Do you remain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 8]: I shall return to town almost immediately .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 6]: Mr. Furneaux will stop here .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 10]: Can he have a bedroom in the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 6]: Tomlinson will look after him .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 10]: You are not going cityward , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 18]: But if you care to have a seat in my car -- '' `` No , thanks .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 12]: The train is quicker and takes me direct to London Bridge .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 4]: Much obliged . ''
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 22]: Fenley hurried to the cloakroom , which was situated under the stairs , but on a lower level than the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 19]: The telephone box was placed there , and Furneaux emerged as the other ran down a few steps .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 7]: The little man hailed him cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 32]: `` I suppose , now , '' he said , `` that hot headed brother of yours thinks he has dodged Scotland Yard till it suits his convenience to be interviewed .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 15]: Strange how people insist on regarding us as novices in our own particular line .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 11]: Now you would n't make that mistake , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 4]: `` What mistake ?
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 14]: I would n't run away , if that is what you mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 9]: `` I 'm sure of that , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 32]: But Mr. Robert has committed the additional folly , from his point of view , of letting us know why he was so desperately anxious to get back to London . ''
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 10]: `` But he did n't say a word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 8]: `` Ah , words , idle words !
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 20]: `` Words are like leaves ; and where they most abound Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 9]: `` It is actions that count , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 5]: Deeds , not words .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 31]: Now , Mr. Robert has been kind enough to give us the eloquent facts , because he will be followed from the suburbs and his whereabouts watched most carefully . ''
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 4]: `` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 13]: I had n't thought of that , '' said Hilton Fenley slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 12]: Two ideas were probably warring in his brain at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 20]: One classed Furneaux as a garrulous idiot ; the other suggested that there might be method in such folly .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 22]: `` That 's a clever simile of Pope 's about dense leaves betokening scarcity of fruit , '' went on Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 11]: `` Of course , it might be pushed too far .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 12]: Think what a poisonous Dead Sea apple the Quarry Wood contained .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 20]: Your father 's murder might not have been possible today but for the cover given by the trees . ''
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 9]: Fenley selected a dark overcoat and derby hat .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 16]: He wore a black tie , but had made no other change in his costume .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 15]: `` You are quite a literary detective , Mr. Furneaux , '' he commented .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 8]: `` More literal than literary , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 14]: I have little leisure for reading , but I own an excellent memory .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 7]: Nothing to boast of in that .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 8]: It 's indispensable in my profession . ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 3]: `` Obviously .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 8]: Well , I must hurry away now .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 5]: See you later . ''
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 4]: He hastened out .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 33]: His manner seemed to hint an annoyance ; it conveyed indefinitely but subtly a suggestion that his father 's death was far too serious a thing to be treated with such levity .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 8]: Furneaux sauntered slowly to the front door .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 13]: By that time the Fenley car was speeding rapidly down the avenue .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 36]: `` With luck , '' he said to Winter , who had joined him , `` with any sort of luck both brothers should pass their father 's body on the way to the mortuary .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 28]: Sometimes , O worthy chief , I find myself regretting the ways and means of the days of old , when men believed in the Judicium Dei .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 11]: `` Neither of those sons went near his dead father .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 15]: If one of them had dared I wonder whether the blood would have liquefied .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 27]: Do you remember , in the ` Nibelungenlied , ' that Hagen is forced to prove his innocence by touching Siegfried 's corpse -- and fails ?
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 8]: That is the point -- he fails .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 7]: Our own Shakespeare knew the dodge .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 31]: When Henry VI was being borne to Chertsey in an open coffin , the Lady Anne made Gloster squirm by her cry : `` O gentlemen , see , see !
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 14]: Dead Henry 's wounds Open their congeal 'd mouths , and bleed afresh .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 15]: `` Why then did those sons fight shy of touching their father 's body ?
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 31]: Had it been your father or mine who was beaten down by a murderer 's spite , we would surely have given him one fare-well clasp of the hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 5]: Winter recognized the symptoms .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 16]: His diminutive friend was examining the embryo of a theory already established in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 15]: It was a mere shadow , something vague and dark and uncertain in outline .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 29]: But it existed , and would assume recognizable shape when an active imagination had fitted some shreds of proof to that which was yet without form and void .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 9]: At that crisis , contradiction was a tonic .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 16]: `` I think you 're in error in one respect , '' said Winter quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 26]: `` Hilton Fenley went to his father 's assistance , and we do n't know whether or not Robert did not approach the body . ''
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 9]: `` You 're wrong , most sapient one .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 20]: Before telephoning Brondesbury I asked Harris to tell me exactly what happened after the banker dropped at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 7]: Harris shouted and knelt over him .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 8]: Miss Manning ran and lifted his head .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 11]: Tomlinson , Harris and Brodie carried him to the settee .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 7]: Hilton Fenley never touched him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 5]: `` What of Robert ?
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 10]: We cleared out , leaving him there alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 13]: `` I watched him until the undertaker 's men were called back .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 9]: Up to that time he had n't moved .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 16]: Bet you a new hat the men will tell you he never went nearer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 12]: `` You buy your own new hats , '' said Winter .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 12]: `` Do you want me to stand you two a day ?
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 7]: I 'm off to the Yard .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 9]: I 'll look up two lines in town .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 12]: ` Phone through if you want help and I 'll come .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 9]: You sleep here tonight if you care to .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 4]: Tomlinson will provide .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 6]: How about the wood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 5]: `` Leave it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 10]: `` You 'll see that artist , Trenholme ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 6]: `` And the bedrooms ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 6]: `` Going there now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 4]: `` So long !
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 17]: Sorry I must quit , but I 'm keen to clear up that telephone call . ''
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 18]: `` If you 're in the office about six I 'll tell you the whole story . ''
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 26]: `` Charles , '' said Winter earnestly , placing a hand on his colleague 's shoulder , `` we gain nothing by rushing our fences .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 30]: This is the toughest job we 've handled this year ; there 's a hard road to travel before we sit down and prepare a brief for counsel . ''
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 16]: `` Of course , I meant the story up to the six o'clock instalment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 3]: Winter smiled .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 22]: He sprang into the car , the chauffeur having already started the engine in obedience to a word from the Superintendent .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 19]: `` Stop at the Brondesbury police station , '' was the order , and Furneaux was left alone .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 33]: He re√´ntered the house and crooked a finger at the butler , who had not summoned up courage to retire to his own sanctum , though a midday meal was awaiting him .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 10]: `` Take me upstairs , '' said the detective .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 9]: `` I shall not detain you many minutes .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 33]: Then you and I will have a snack together and you 'll borrow a bicycle for me , and I sha 'n' t trouble you any more till a late hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 13]: `` No trouble at all , sir , '' Tomlinson assured him .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 19]: `` If I could advance your inquiry in the least degree I 'd fast cheerfully all day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 17]: `` What I like about you , Tomlinson , is your restraint , '' said Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 26]: `` Many a man would have offered to fast a week , not meaning to deny himself a toothful five minutes longer than was avoidable .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 17]: Now you really mean what you say -- Ah , this is Mr. Robert 's den .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 10]: And that is his bedroom , with dressing-room adjoining .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 7]: Very cozy , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 16]: Of course , the rooms have been dusted regularly since he disappeared on Saturday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 7]: `` Every day , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 11]: `` Well , I hate prying into people 's rooms .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 7]: Beastly liberty , I call it .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 7]: Now for Mr. Hilton 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 8]: `` Is that all , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 21]: inquired the butler , manifestly surprised by the cursory glance which the detective had given around the suite of apartments .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 8]: `` All at present , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 17]: Like the Danites ' messengers , I 'm only spying out the lie of the land .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 12]: Ah , each brother occupied a corner of the east wing .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 13]: Robert , north , Hilton , south -- a most equitable arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 11]: Now these rooms show signs of tenancy , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 23]: They were standing in Hilton Fenley 's sitting-room , having traversed the whole of the gallery around the hall to reach it .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 19]: The remains of a fire in the grate caught Furneaux 's eye , and the butler coughed apologetically .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 24]: `` Mr. Hilton wo n't have his rooms touched , sir , until he leaves home of a morning , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 17]: `` He likes to find his papers , et cetera , where he put them overnight .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 31]: As a rule the housemaid comes here soon after breakfast , but this morning -- naturally -- '' `` Of course , of course , '' assented the other promptly .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 8]: `` Everything is at sixes and sevens .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 8]: Would you mind sending the girl here ?
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 11]: I 'd like to have a word with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 8]: Tomlinson moved ponderously towards an electric bell .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 5]: `` Do n't ring .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 6]: Just ask her to come .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 14]: Then she can bring me to your place and we 'll nibble something .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 8]: Meanwhile I 'll enjoy this view . ''
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 5]: `` Certainly , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 7]: That will suit me admirably . ''
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 7]: Tomlinson walked out with stately tread .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 26]: His broad back was scarcely turned before the detective 's nimble feet had carried him into the bedroom , which stood in the southeast angle .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 16]: He seemed to fly around the room like one possessed of a fiend of unrest .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 16]: Picking up a glass tumbler , he sniffed it and put it in a pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 31]: He peered at the bed , the dressing-table , the carpet ; opened drawers and wardrobe doors , examined towels in the bathroom , and stuffed one beneath his waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 42]: Running back to the sitting-room , he found a torn envelope , and began picking up some specks of grit from the carpet , each of which went into a corner of the envelope , which he folded and stowed away .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 12]: Then he bent over the fireplace and rummaged among the cinders .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 13]: Three calcined lumps , not wholly consumed , appeared to interest him .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 25]: A newspaper was handy ; he wrapped the grimy treasure trove in a sheet , and that small parcel also went into a pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 43]: When a swish of skirts on the stairs announced the housemaid he retreated to the bedroom , and the girl found him standing at a south window , gazing out over the fair vista of the Italian terraces and the rolling parkland .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 11]: `` Yes , sir , '' said the girl timidly .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 12]: He turned , as if he had not heard her approach .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 24]: She was pale , and her eyes were red , for the feminine portion of the household was in a state of collapse .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 23]: `` I only wanted to ask why a fire is laid in the sitting-room in such fine weather , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 28]: `` Mr. Hilton sits up late , sir , and if the evening is at all chilly , he puts a match to the grate himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 7]: `` Ah , a silly question .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 22]: Do n't tell anybody I spoke of it or they 'll think me a funny detective , wo n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 11]: He smiled genially , and the girl 's face brightened .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 13]: `` I do n't see that , sir , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 14]: `` I do n't know why Mr. Hilton wanted a fire last night .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 5]: It was quite hot .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 9]: I slept with my window wide open . ''
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 8]: `` A very healthy habit , too .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 10]: Do you attend to Mr. Robert 's suite ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 10]: `` Does _ he _ have a fire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 9]: `` Never in the summer , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 14]: `` He 's a warmer-blooded creature than Mr. Hilton , I fancy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 8]: `` I expect so , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 10]: `` Well , now , there 's nothing here .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 9]: But we detectives have to nose around everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 13]: I 'm sure you are terribly upset by your master 's death .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 8]: Everybody gives him a good word . ''
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 9]: `` Indeed , he deserved it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 5]: We all liked him .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 8]: He was strict but very generous . ''
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 21]: Furneaux chatted with her while they descended the stairs and traversed devious passages till the butler 's room was gained .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 18]: By that time the housemaid was convinced that Mr. Furneaux was `` a very nice man . ''
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 22]: When she `` did '' Hilton Fenley 's rooms she missed the glass , but gave no heed to its absence .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 15]: Who would bother about a glass in a house where murder had been done ?
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 11]: She simply replaced it by another of the same pattern .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 44]: `` May I inquire , sir , '' said Tomlinson , when Furneaux had washed face and hands and was seated at a table laid for two , `` may I inquire if you have any preference as to a luncheon wine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 26]: `` I think , '' said Furneaux with due solemnity , `` that a still wine -- '' `` I agree with you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 52]: At this time of the day a Sauterne or a Johannisberger -- '' `` To my taste , a Ch√¢teau Yquem , with that delicate flavor which leaves the palate fresh -- Frenchmen call it the _ s√®ve _ -- '' `` Sir , I perceive that you have a taste .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 15]: Singularly enough , I have a bottle of Ch√¢teau Yquem in my sideboard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 7]: So the meal was a success .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 8]: An under gardener lent Furneaux a bicycle .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 24]: After a chat with Farrow , to whom he conveyed some sandwiches and a bottle of beer , the detective rode to Easton .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 28]: He sent a rather long telegram to his own quarters , called at a chemist 's , and reached the White Horse at Roxton about two o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 35]: * * * * * Now the imp of mischance had contrived that John Trenholme should hear no word of the murder until he came downstairs for luncheon after a morning 's steady work .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 27]: The stout Eliza , fearful lest Mary should forestall her with the news , bounced out from the kitchen when his step sounded on the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 21]: `` There was fine goin 's on in the park this morning , Mr. Trenholme , '' she began breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 11]: He reddened at once , and avoided her fiery eye .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 15]: Of course , it had been discovered that he had watched that girl bathing .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 9]: Dash it all , his action was unintentional !
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 4]: What a bore !
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 15]: `` Mr. Fenley was shot dead on his own doorstep , '' continued Eliza .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 9]: She gave proper emphasis to the concluding words .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 27]: That a man should be murdered `` on his own doorstep '' was a feature of the crime that enhanced the tragedy in the public mind .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 39]: The shooting was bad enough in itself , for rural England is happily free from such horrors ; but swift and brutal death dealt out on one 's own doorstep was a thing at once monstrous and awe-compelling .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 41]: Eliza , perhaps , wondered why Mr. Trenholme flushed , but she fully understood the sudden blanching of his face at her tidings , for all Roxton was shaken to its foundations when the facts slowly percolated in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 5]: `` Good Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 3]: cried he .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 10]: `` Could that be the shot I heard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 12]: `` He was killed at half past nine , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 5]: `` Then it was !
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 16]: A keeper heard it , too -- and a policeman -- our Roxton policeman . ''
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 10]: `` That would be Farrow , '' said Eliza .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 21]: `` What was _ he _ doin ' , the lazy-bones , that he could n't catch the villain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 5]: `` What villain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 10]: `` The man who killed poor Mr. Fenley . ''
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 10]: `` They know who did it , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 5]: `` Well , no .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 21]: There 's all sorts o ' tales flyin ' about , but you ca n't believe any of 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 8]: `` But why are you blaming Farrow ?
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 6]: He 's a good fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 3]: He sings .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 6]: No real scoundrel can sing .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 8]: Read any novel , any newspaper report .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 11]: ` The prisoner 's voice was harsh and unmusical . '
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 10]: You 've seen those words scores of times . ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 26]: In his relief at learning that his own escapade was not published broadcast , Trenholme had momentarily forgotten the dreadful nature of Eliza 's statement .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 7]: She followed him into the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 22]: `` You 'll be a witness , I suppose , '' she said , anxious to secure details of the shot-firing .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 5]: `` A witness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 4]: he repeated blankly .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 17]: There ca n't be a deal o ' folk who heard the gun go off . ''
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 22]: `` By Jove , Eliza , I believe you 're right , '' he said , gazing at her in dismay .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 27]: `` Now that I come to think of it , I am probably the only person in existence who can say where that shot came from .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 7]: It was a rifle , too .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 11]: I spoke of it to the keeper and Farrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 16]: `` I was sure something would happen when I dreamed of suffrigettes this mornin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 12]: An ' that comes of playin ' pranks , Mr. Trenholme .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 22]: If it was n't for that alarm clock -- '' `` Oh , come , Eliza , '' he broke in .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 10]: `` An alarm clock is n't a Gatling gun .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 7]: Your association of ideas is faulty .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 31]: There is much in common between the clatter of an alarm clock and the suffragist cause , but all the ladies promised not to endanger life , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 16]: `` Anyhow , Mr. Fenley is dead as a doornail , '' said Eliza firmly .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 4]: `` Too bad .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 22]: I take back all the hard things I said about him , and I 'm sure you do the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 4]: `` Me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 10]: Did n't you say all the Fenleys were rubbish ?
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 13]: One of them , at any rate , was wrongly classified . ''
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 5]: `` Which one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 6]: Trenholme bethought himself in time .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 12]: `` This unfortunate banker , of course , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 10]: `` I 'd a notion you meant Miss Sylvia .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 22]: She 's pretty as a picter -- prettier than some picters I 've seen -- and folk speak well of her .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 8]: But she 's not a Fenley . ''
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 34]: At any other time the artist would have received that thrust _ en tierce _ with a _ riposte _ ; at present , Eliza 's facts were more interesting than her wit .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 11]: `` Who is the lady you are speaking of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 4]: he asked guardedly .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 10]: `` Mr. Fenley 's ward , Miss Sylvia Manning .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 6]: They say she 's rich .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 4]: Pore young thing !
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 25]: Some schemin ' man will turn her head , I 'll go bail , an ' all for the sake of her brass . ''
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 12]: `` Most likely a one-legged gunner , name of Jim . ''
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 16]: `` Well , it wo n't be a two-legged painter , name of Jack ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 5]: And Eliza bounced out .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 34]: Now , Mary of the curl papers , having occasion to go upstairs while Trenholme was eating , peeped through the open door of the room which he had converted into a studio .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 21]: She saw a picture on the easel , and the insatiable curiosity of her class led her to examine it .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 11]: Even a country kitchen maid came under its spell instantly .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 16]: After a pause of mingled admiration and shocked prudery , she sped to the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 18]: `` Seein ' is believin ' , '' quoted Eliza , mounting the stairs in her turn .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 22]: She gazed at the drawing brazenly , with hands resting on hips and head cocked sidewise like an inquisitive hen 's .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 8]: `` Well , I never did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 4]: was her verdict .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 23]: Back in the kitchen again , she announced firmly to Mary -- '' _ I 'll _ take in the cheese . ''
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 12]: She put the Stilton on the table with a determined air .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 16]: `` You do n't know anything about Miss Sylvia Manning , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 7]: she said , with calm guile .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 16]: `` Never heard the lady 's name before you mentioned it , '' said Trenholme .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 21]: `` Mebbe not , but it strikes me you 've _ seen _ more of her than most folk . ''
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 22]: `` Eliza , '' he cried , without any pretense at smiling good humor , `` you 've been sneaking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 8]: `` Sneakin ' , you call it ?
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 17]: I ` appened to pass your room , an ' who could help lookin ' in ?
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 10]: I was never so taken aback in me life .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 12]: You could ha ' knocked me down with a feather . ''
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 18]: `` An ostrich feather with an ostrich 's leg behind it , '' was the angry retort .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 10]: Eliza 's eyes glinted with the fire of battle .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 9]: `` The shameless ways of girls nowadays ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 3]: she breathed .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 23]: `` To let any young man gaze at her in them sort of clothes , if you can call 'em clothes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 6]: `` It was an accident .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 8]: She did n't know I was there .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 28]: Anyhow , you dare utter another word about that picture , even hint at its existence , and I 'll paint you without any clothes at all .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 8]: I mean that , so beware ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 14]: `` Sorry to interrupt , '' said a high-pitched voice from the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 11]: `` You are Mr. John Trenholme , I take it ?
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 5]: May I come in ?
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 6]: My name 's Furneaux . ''
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 9]: `` Jim , of the Royal Artillery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 4]: demanded Trenholme angrily .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 8]: Charles Fran√ßois , of Scotland Yard . ''
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 6]: Eliza fled , completely cowed .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 9]: She began to weep , in noisy gulps .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 7]: `` I 've dud-dud-done it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 7]: she explained to agitated curl papers .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 6]: `` That pup-pup-pore Mr. Trenholme .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 6]: They 've cuc-cuc-come for him .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 17]: He 'll be lul-lul-locked up , an ' all along o ' my wu-wu-wicked tongue ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 21]: CHAPTER VII SOME SIDE ISSUES Trenholme , rather interested than otherwise , did not blanch at mention of Scotland Yard .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 32]: `` Walk right in , Mr. Furneaux , '' he said ; he had picked up a few tricks of speech from Transatlantic brethren of the brush met at Julien 's .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 6]: `` Have you lunched ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 8]: `` Excellently , '' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 5]: `` Not in Roxton .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 22]: I defy you to produce a cook in this village that shall compare with our Eliza of the White Horse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 11]: `` Sir , my thoughts do not dwell on viands .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 16]: True , I ate with a butler , but I drank wine with a connoisseur .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 10]: It was a Ch√¢teau Yquem of the eighties . ''
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 9]: `` Then you should be in expansive mood .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 28]: Before you demand with a scowl why I shot Mr. Fenley you might tell me why the headquarters of the London Police is named Scotland Yard . ''
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 16]: `` Because it was first housed in a street of that name near Trafalgar Square .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 25]: Scotland Yard was a palace at one time , built in a spirit of mistaken hospitality for the reception of prominent Scots visiting London .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 21]: We entertained so many and so lavishly that ` Gang Sooth ' has become a proverb beyond the Tweed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 21]: `` There is virtue , I perceive , in a bottle of Ch√¢teau Yquem -- or was it two ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 13]: `` In one there is light , but two might produce fireworks .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 27]: Now , sir , if you have finished luncheon , kindly take me to your room and show me the sketches you made this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 7]: The artist raised an inquiring eyebrow .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 29]: `` I have the highest respect for your profession in the abstract , but it is new to find it dabbling in art criticism , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 39]: `` I assure you , Mr. Trenholme , that any drawings of yours made in the neighborhood of The Towers before half past nine o'clock today will be most valuable pieces of evidence -- if nothing more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 26]: Though Furneaux 's manner was grave as an owl 's , a certain gleam in his eye gave the requisite sting to the concluding words .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 20]: Trenholme , at any other time , would have delighted in him , but dropped his bantering air forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 13]: `` I do n't mind exhibiting my work , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 9]: `` It will not be a novel experience .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 5]: Come this way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 22]: Watched by two awe-stricken women from the passage leading to the kitchen , the artist and his visitor ascended the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 37]: Trenholme walked straight to the easel , took off the drawing of Sylvia Manning and the Aphrodite , placed it on the floor face to the wall , and staged the sketch of the Elizabethan house .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 27]: Furneaux screwed his eyelids to secure a half light ; then , making a cylinder of his right hand , peered through it with one eye .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 4]: `` Admirable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 11]: `` Corot , with some of the breadth of Constable .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 7]: Forgive the comparisons , Mr. Trenholme .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 26]: Of course , the style is your own , but one uses the names of accepted masters largely as adjectives to explain one 's meaning .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 6]: You are a true impressionist .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 23]: You paint Nature as you see her , not as she is , yet your technique is superb and your observation just .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 18]: For instance , every shadow in this lovely drawing shows that the hour was about eight o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 25]: But , in painting figures , I have no doubt you sink the impressionist in the realist ... The other sketch , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 18]: `` The other sketch is a mere color note for future guidance , '' said Trenholme offhandedly .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 14]: `` It happens also to be a recognizable portrait of Miss Sylvia Manning .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 11]: I 'm sorry , but I must see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 6]: `` Suppose I refuse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 14]: `` It will be obtained by other methods than a polite request . ''
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 13]: `` I 'm afraid I shall have to run the risk . ''
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 8]: `` No , you wo n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 9]: And the detective 's tone became eminently friendly .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 12]: `` You 'll just produce it within the next half minute .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 34]: You are not the sort of man who would care to drag a lady 's name into a police-court wrangle , which can be the only outcome of present stubbornness on your part .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 19]: I know you were hidden among those cedars between , say , eight o'clock and half past nine .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 14]: I know that Miss Manning bathed in a lake well within your view .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 27]: I know , too , that you sketched her , because I saw the canvas a moment ago -- an oil , not a water color .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 42]: These things may or may not be relevant to an inquiry into a crime , but they will certainly loom large in the public mind if the police have to explain why they needed a warrant to search your apartments . ''
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 8]: Furneaux had gauged the artistic temperament accurately .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 14]: Without another word of protest Trenholme placed the disputed canvas on the easel .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 6]: `` Do you smoke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 5]: inquired the detective suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 13]: What the deuce has my smoking got to do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 22]: `` I fancied that , perhaps , you might like to have a pipe while I examine this gem at leisure .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 18]: One does not gabble the common-places of life when in the presence of the supreme in art .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 29]: I find that a really fine picture induces a feeling of reverence , an emotion akin to the influence of a mountain range , or a dim cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 4]: Pray burn incense .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 11]: I am almost tempted to regret being a non-smoker . ''
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 29]: Trenholme had heard no man talk in that strain since last he sat outside the Caf√© Margery and watched the stream of life flowing along the Grand Boulevard .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 32]: Almost unconsciously he yielded to the spell of a familiar jargon , well knowing he had been inspired in every touch while striving frenziedly to give permanence to a fleeting vision .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 14]: He filled his pipe , and surveyed the detective with a quickened interest .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 6]: Furneaux gazed long and earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 4]: `` Perfect ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 8]: he murmured , after that rapt pause .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 12]: `` Such a portrait , too , without any apparent effort !
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 17]: Just compare the cold sunlight on the statue with the same light falling on wet skin .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 14]: Of course , Mr. Trenholme , you 'll send this to the Salon .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 13]: Burlington House finds satiety in Mayors and Masters of Fox Hounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 8]: `` Good , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 3]: agreed Trenholme .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 14]: `` What a cursed spite that it must be consumed in flame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 5]: `` But why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 6]: cried Furneaux , unfeignedly horrified .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 13]: `` Dash it all , man , I can never copy it .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 20]: And you would n't have me blazon that girl 's face in a gallery after today 's tragedy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 6]: The detective snapped his fingers .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 4]: `` Poof ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 16]: `` I shall have Mr. Fenley 's murderer hanged long before your picture is hung .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 17]: London provides one front-rank tragedy a week , but not another such masterpiece in ten years .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 7]: Burn it because of a sentiment !
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 5]: Perish the thought . ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 30]: `` If I had guessed you were coming here so promptly it would have been in ashes an hour ago , '' said Trenholme , grimly insistent on sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 15]: With a disconcerting change of manner the detective promptly assumed a dryly official attitude .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 18]: `` A mighty good job for you that nothing of the sort occurred , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 10]: `` Your picture is your excuse , Mr. Trenholme .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 24]: What plea could you have urged for spying on a lady in an open-air bath if deprived of the only valid one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 5]: `` Look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 5]: came the angry retort .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 21]: `` You seem to be a pretty fair judge of a drawing , but you choose your words rather carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 25]: Just now you described me as ` hidden ' behind that clump of trees , and again you accuse me of ` spying . '
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 24]: I wo n't stand that sort of thing from Scotland Yard , nor from Buckingham Palace , if it comes to that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 8]: Furneaux instantly reverted to his French vein .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 6]: His shrug was eminently Parisian .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 5]: `` You misunderstand me .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 10]: I allege neither hiding nor spying on your part .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 8]: Name of a good little gray man !
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 23]: The President of the Royal Academy would hide and spy for a month if he could palliate his conduct by that picture .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 11]: But , given no picture , what is the answer ?
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 17]: Reflect calmly , Mr. Trenholme , and you 'll see that mine are words of wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 15]: Burn that canvas , and you cut a sorry figure in the witness box .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 23]: Moreover , suppose you treat the law with disdain , how do you propose explaining your actions to Miss Sylvia Manning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 13]: `` In all probability , I shall never meet the lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 9]: `` Oh , wo n't you , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 25]: I have the honor to request you to meet her tomorrow morning by the shore of that sylvan lake at nine fifteen , sharp .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 8]: And kindly bring both sketches with you .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 31]: Only , for goodness ' sake , keep this one covered with a water-proof wrap if the weather breaks , which it does n't look like doing at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 21]: Now , Mr. Trenholme , take the advice of a dried-up chip of experience like me , and be sensible .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 6]: One word as to actualities .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 24]: I 'm told you did n't see anything in the park which led you to believe that a crime had been committed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 5]: `` Not a thing .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 34]: I heard the gunshot , and noted where it came from , but so far as I could ascertain , the only creatures it disturbed were some rabbits , rooks and pheasants . ''
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 8]: Where did the pheasants show up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 17]: `` Out of the wood , close to the spot where the rifle was fired . ''
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 5]: `` How many ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 6]: `` How many what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 4]: `` Pheasants . ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 4]: `` A brace .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 18]: They flew right across the south front of the house to a covert on the west side .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 7]: Is that an important detail ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 16]: `` When you hear the evidence you may find it so , '' commented Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 9]: `` Why do you say ` rifle ' ?
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 8]: Why not plain ` gun ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 20]: `` Because any one who has handled both a rifle and a shotgun can recognize the difference in sound .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 17]: The explosive force of the one is many times greater than that of the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 11]: `` Are you , too , an expert marksman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 7]: `` I can shoot a bit .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 20]: Hardly an expert , perhaps , seeing that I have n't used a gun during the past five years .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 30]: If you know France , Mr. Furneaux , you 'll agree that British ideas of sport -- '' `` I do know France , '' broke in the detective .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 29]: `` There is n't a cock robin or a jenny wren left in the country ... As a mere formality , what magazine are you working for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 22]: Trenholme told him , and Furneaux hurried away , halting for an instant in the doorway to raise a warning finger .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 14]: `` Tomorrow , at the cedars , nine fifteen , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 17]: `` And , mind you , no holocausts , or you 're up a gum tree .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 12]: You were either painting a pretty girl or gloating over her .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 30]: Prove the one and people wo n't think the other , which they will be only too ready to do , this being a cynical and suspicious world . ''
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 9]: He left a bewildered artist glaring after him .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 18]: Trenholme 's acquaintance with the police , either of England or France , was of the slightest .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 46]: Sometimes , when overexcited by the discovery of some new and entrancing upland in the domain of art , he had bought or borrowed a volume of light fiction in order to read himself to sleep , and a detective figured occasionally in such pages .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 29]: Usually , the official was a pig-headed idiot , whose blunders and narrow-mindedness served as admirable whetstones for the preternaturally sharp intelligence of an amateur investigator of crime .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 61]: Trenholme , like the average reader , did not know that such self-appointed sleuths are snubbed and despised by Scotland Yard , that they seldom or never base their fantastic theories on facts , or that , in fiction , they act in a way which would entail their own speedy appearance in the dock if practiced in real life .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 7]: Furneaux came as a positive revelation .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 65]: A small , wiry individual who looked like a comedian and spouted the truisms of the studio , a wizened little whippersnapper who put hardly one direct question to a prospective witness , but whose caustic comments had placed a new and vastly disagreeable aspect on the morning 's adventure -- such a man to be the representative of staid and heavy-footed Scotland Yard !
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 7]: Well , wonders would never cease .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 19]: It was not for a bewildered artist yet to know that Furneaux 's genius alone excused his eccentricities .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 11]: And he , Trenholme , was to meet the girl !
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 11]: He turned to the easel and looked at the picture .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 16]: A few hours ago he had reviled the fate that seemed to forbid their meeting .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 38]: Now he was to be brought to her , though somewhat after the fashion of a felon with gyves on his wrists , since Furneaux 's request for the morrow 's rendezvous rang ominously like a command .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 10]: Indeed , indeed , it was a mad world !
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 29]: At any rate , he did not , as he had intended , tear the canvas from its stretcher and apply a match to it in the grate .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 13]: Thus far , then , had Furneaux 's queer method been justified .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 16]: He had hit on the one certain means of restraint on an act of vandalism .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 11]: The picture now stood between Trenholme and the scoffing multitude .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 10]: It was his buckler against the shafts of innuendo .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 26]: Rather than lose it before his actions were vindicated he would suffer the depletion to the last penny of a not altogether meager bank account .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 24]: Of course , this open-souled youngster never dreamed that the detective had read his style and attributes in one lightning-swift glance of intuition .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 22]: Before ever Trenholme was aware of a stranger standing in the open doorway of the dining-room Furneaux had taken his measure .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 10]: `` English , a gentleman , art-trained in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 31]: Thinks the loss of La Giaconde a far more serious event than a revolution , and regards the Futurist school pretty much as the Home Secretary regards the militant suffragists .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 15]: Knows as much about the murder as I do about the rings of Saturn .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 20]: But he ought to provide a touch of humor in an affair that promises little else than heavy tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 25]: And it will do Miss Sylvia Manning some good if she is made to see that there are others than Fenleys in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 7]: So , have at him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 16]: While going downstairs , the detective became aware of some sniffing in the back passage .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 19]: Eliza red-eyed now from distress , stood there , dabbing her cheeks with a corner of her apron .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 22]: `` Pup-pup-please , sir , '' she began , but quailed under a sudden and penetrating look from those beady eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 8]: `` Well , what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 3]: inquired Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 12]: A violent nudge from curl papers stirred the cook 's wits .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 23]: `` I do hope you dud-dud-didn ' t pay any heed to anythink I was a-sayin ' of , '' she stammered .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 9]: `` Mr. Trenholme would n't hurt a fuf-fuf-fly .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 23]: I sus-sus-saw the picter , an ' was on ' y a-teasin ' of ` im , like a sus-sus-silly woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 3]: `` Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 20]: Yet he heaps coals of fire on your head by declaring that you are the best cook in Hertfordshire !
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 5]: Is that true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 10]: Furneaux 's impish grin was a tonic in itself .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 9]: Eliza dropped the apron and squared her elbows .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 39]: `` I do n't know about bein ' the best in Hertfordshire , '' she cried , `` but I can hold me own no matter where the other one comes from , provided we start fair . ''
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 56]: `` Take warning , then , that if I bring a man here tomorrow evening -- a big man , with a round head and bulging blue eyes -- a man who looks as though he can use a carving-knife with discretion -- you prepare a dinner worthy of the reputation of the White Horse !
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 16]: In that way , and in none other , can you rehabilitate your character . ''
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 9]: Furneaux was gone before Eliza recovered her breath .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 8]: Then she turned on the kitchen maid .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 11]: `` Wot was it he said about my char-ac-ter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 4]: she demanded warmly .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 12]: `` An ' wot are _ you _ grinnin ' at ?
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 26]: If it was n't for _ your _ peepin ' an ' pryin ' I 'd never ha ' set eyes on that blessed picter .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 43]: You go an ' put on a black dress , an ' do yer hair respectable , an ' mind yer do n't spend half an hour perkin ' an ' preenin ' in front of a lookin ' - glass . ''
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 10]: Mary fled , and Eliza bustled into the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 17]: `` A big man , with a round head an ' bulgin ' blue eyes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 4]: she muttered wrathfully .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 28]: `` Does he think I 'm afraid of that sort of brewer 's drayman , or of a little man with eyes like a ferret , either ?
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 10]: If he does , he 's very much mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 11]: I do n't believe he 's a real ` tec .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 14]: I would n't be a bit surprised if he was n't a reporter .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 11]: They 've cheek enough for ten , as a rule .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 17]: Talkin ' about my char-ac-ter , an ' before that hussy of a girl , too !
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 12]: Wait till I see him tomorrow , that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 30]: Meanwhile , Furneaux had not held the second glass of Ch√¢teau Yquem to the light in Tomlinson 's sanctum before Winter 's car was halting outside Brondesbury police station .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 26]: An Inspector assured the Superintendent that a constable was on the track of Robert Fenley , and had instructions to report direct to Scotland Yard .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 12]: Then Winter re√´ntered the car , and was driven to Headquarters .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 26]: He was lunching in his own room , frugally but well , on bread and cheese and beer , when the Assistant Commissioner came in .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 10]: `` Ah , Mr. Winter , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 8]: `` I was told you had returned .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 12]: That telephone call came from a call office in Shaftesbury Avenue .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 29]: A lady , name unknown , but the youth in charge knows her well by sight , and thinks she lives in a set of flats near by .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 19]: I thought the information sufficient for your purpose , so suspended inquiries till I heard from you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 12]: `` Just what I wanted , sir , '' said Winter .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 28]: `` There may be nothing in it , but I was curious to know why Hilton Fenley took the trouble to fib about such a trivial matter .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 14]: His brother , too , is behaving in a way that invites criticism .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 43]: I do n't imagine that either of the sons shot his father -- most certainly , Hilton Fenley could not have done it , and Robert , I think , was in London at the time -- '' `` Dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 25]: broke in the other , a man of quiet , self-contained manner , on whose lips that mild exclamation betokened the maximum of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 20]: `` Is there any reason whatsoever for believing that one of these young men may be a parricide ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 38]: `` So many reasons , sir , and so convincing in some respects , that the local police would be seriously considering the arrest of Robert Fenley if they had the ascertained facts in their possession . ''
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 6]: The Assistant Commissioner sat down .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 19]: `` I hear you keep a sound brand of cigars here , Mr. Winter , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 36]: `` I 've just lunched in the St. Stephen 's Club , so , if you can spare the time -- '' At the end of the Superintendent 's recital the Chief offered no comment .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 24]: He arose , went to the window , and seemed to seek inspiration from busy Westminster Bridge and a river dancing in sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 19]: After a long pause he turned , and threw the unconsumed half of a cigar into the fireplace .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 33]: `` It 's a pity to waste such a perfect Havana , '' he said mournfully , `` but I make it a rule not to smoke while passing along the corridors .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 7]: And -- you 'll be busy .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 5]: Keep me posted . ''
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 3]: Winter smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 12]: When the door had closed on his visitor he even laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 5]: `` By Jove ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 5]: he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 16]: `` A heart to heart talk with the guv ` nor is always most illuminative .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 39]: Now many another boss would have said he was puzzled , or bothered , or have given me some silly advice such as that I must be discreet , look into affairs closely , and not act precipitately .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 20]: Not so our excellent A. C. He 's clean bowled , and admits it , without speaking a word .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 10]: He 's a tonic ; he really is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 6]: He touched an electric bell .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 24]: When the policeman attendant , Johnston , appeared , he asked if Detective Sergeant Sheldon was in the building , and Sheldon came .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 69]: The Superintendent had met him in a Yorkshire town during a protracted and difficult inquiry into the death of a wealthy recluse ; although the man was merely an ordinary constable he had shown such resourcefulness , such ability of a rare order , that he was invited to join the staff of the Criminal Investigation Department , and had warranted Winter 's judgment by earning rapid promotion .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 20]: Though tall , and of athletic build , he had none of the distinctive traits of the average policeman .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 34]: He dressed quietly and in good taste , and carried himself easily ; a peculiarity of his thoughtful , somewhat lawyer-like face was that the left eye was noticeably smaller than the right .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 29]: Among other qualifications , he ranked as the best amateur photographer in the `` Yard , '' and was famous as a rock climber in the Lake District .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 10]: Winter plunged at once into the business in hand .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 22]: `` Sheldon , '' he said , `` I 'm going out , and may be absent an hour or longer .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 24]: If a telephone message comes through from Mr. Furneaux tell him I have located the doubtful call made to The Towers this morning .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 15]: Have you read the report of the Fenley murder in the evening papers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 8]: _ Is _ it a murder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 8]: `` What else could it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 6]: `` An extraordinary accident . ''
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 13]: Winter weighed the point , which had not occurred to him previously .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 7]: `` No , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 6]: `` It was no accident .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 20]: I incline to the belief that it was the best-planned crime I 've tackled during the past few years .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 10]: That is my present opinion , at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 42]: Now , a man from the Brondesbury police station is following one of the dead man 's sons , a Mr. Robert Fenley , who bolted back to London on a motor cycle as soon as I threatened to question him .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 25]: `` Robert Fenley is twenty-four , fresh-complexioned , clean-shaven , about five feet nine inches in height , stoutish , and of sporty appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 11]: He had his hair cut yesterday or the day before .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 8]: His hands and feet are rather small .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 21]: He talks aggressively , and looks what he is , a pampered youth , very much spoiled by his parents .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 15]: His clothes -- all that I have seen -- are a motorist 's overalls .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 15]: If the Brondesbury man reports here during my absence act as you think fit .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 27]: I want Robert Fenley located , followed , and watched unobtrusively , especially in such matters as the houses he visits and the people he meets .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 8]: If you need help get it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 8]: `` Till what time , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 5]: was the laconic question .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 4]: `` That depends .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 10]: Try and ` phone me here about five o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 11]: But if you are otherwise engaged let the telephone go .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 23]: Should Fenley seem to leave London by the Edgware Road , which leads to Roxton , have him checked on the way .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 21]: Here is the number of his cycle , '' and Winter jotted a memorandum on the back of an envelope .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 14]: `` What about Mr. Furneaux if I am called out almost immediately ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 8]: `` Give the message to Johnston . ''
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 37]: Then Winter hurried away , and , repressing the inclination to hail a taxi , walked up Whitehall and crossed Trafalgar Square _ en route _ to the Shaftesbury Avenue address supplied by the Assistant Commissioner .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 21]: He found a sharp-featured youth in charge of the telephone , which was lodged in an estate agent 's office .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 10]: The boy grinned when the Superintendent explained his errand .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 32]: `` Excuse _ me _ , '' he said , with the pert assurance of the born Cockney , `` but we are n't allowed to give information about customers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 15]: `` You 've broken your rules already , young man , '' said Winter .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 15]: `` You answered a similar inquiry made by Scotland Yard some hours since . ''
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 9]: `` Oh , was _ that _ it ?
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 15]: Gerrard rang me up , and I thought there was something funny going on .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 9]: Are you from Scotland Yard , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 13]: Winter proffered a card , and the boy 's eyes opened wide .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 4]: `` Crikey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 9]: `` I 've read about you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 15]: Well , I 've been doing a bit of detective work of my own .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 33]: At lunch time I strolled past the set of flats where I thought the lady lived , and had the luck to see her getting out of a cab at the door .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 18]: I followed her upstairs , pretending I had business somewhere , and saw her go into No .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 2]: Eleven .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 17]: Her name is Miss Eileen Garth -- at least , that 's the name opposite No .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 9]: Eleven in the list in the hall . ''
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 17]: `` When you 're a bit older you 'll make a detective , '' said Winter .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 20]: `` You 've learned the first trick of the job , and that is to keep your eyes open .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 13]: Now , to encourage you , I 'll tell you the second .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 5]: Keep your mouth shut .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 40]: If this lady is Miss Garth she is not the person we want , but it would annoy her if she heard the police were inquiring about her ; so here is half a crown for your trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 12]: `` Can I do anything else for you , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 5]: came the eager demand .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 18]: I 'm on the wrong scent , evidently , but you have saved me from wasting time .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 11]: This Miss Eileen Garth is English , of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 13]: `` Yes , sir ; very good-looking , but rather snappy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 3]: Winter sighed .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 15]: `` That just shows how easy it is to blunder , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 24]: `` I 'm looking for a Polish Jewess , whose chief feature is her nose , and who wears big gold earrings . ''
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 15]: `` Oh , Miss Garth is quite different , '' said the disappointed youth .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 29]: `` She 's tall and slim -- a regular dasher , big black hat , swell togs , black and white , and smart boots with white spats .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 15]: She wore pearls in her ears , too , because I noticed 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 4]: Winter sighed again .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 14]: `` Another half day lost , '' he murmured , and went out .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 51]: Knowing well that the boy would note the direction he took , he turned away from the block of flats and made for Soho , where he smoked a thin , raffish Italian cigar with an Anarchist of his acquaintance who kept a restaurant famous for its _ risotto _ .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 21]: Then , by other streets , he approached Gloucester Mansions , and soon was pressing the electric bell of No .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 2]: Eleven .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 6]: `` Miss Garth in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 13]: he said to an elderly , hatchet-faced woman who opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 9]: `` Why do you want Miss Garth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 25]: was the non-committal reply , given in the tone of one who meant the stranger to understand that he was not addressing a servant .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 16]: `` I shall explain my errand to the lady herself , '' said Winter civilly .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 23]: `` Kindly tell her that Superintendent Winter , of the Criminal Investigation Department , Scotland Yard , wishes to see her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 49]: To him it was no new thing that his name and description should bring dismay , even terror , to the cheeks of one to whom he made himself known professionally , but unless he was addressing some desperate criminal , he did not expect to be assaulted .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 49]: For once , therefore , he was thoroughly surprised when a bony hand shot out and pushed him backward ; the door was slammed in his face ; the latch clicked , and he was left staring at a small brass plate bearing the legend : `` Ring .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 5]: Do not knock . ''
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 16]: Naturally , this bold maneuver could not have succeeded had he a right of entry .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 30]: A woman 's physical strength was unequal to the task of disturbing his burly frame , and a foot thrust between door and jamb would have done the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 24]: As matters stood , however , he was obliged to abandon any present hope of an interview with the mysterious Miss Eileen Garth .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 22]: He remained stock still for some seconds , listening to the retreating footsteps of the strong-minded person who had beaten him .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 31]: It was his habit to visualize for future reference the features and demeanor of people in whom he was interested , and of whom circumstances permitted only the merest glimpse .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 11]: This woman 's face had revealed annoyance rather than fear .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 12]: `` Scotland Yard '' was not an ogre but a nuisance .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 24]: She held , or , at any rate , she had exercised , a definite power of rejecting visitors whom she considered undesirable .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 15]: Therefore , she was a relative , probably Eileen Garth 's mother or aunt .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 17]: Eileen Garth was `` tall and slim , '' `` good-looking , but rather snappy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 19]: Well , twenty years ago , the description would have applied to the woman he had just seen .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 17]: Her voice , heard under admittedly adverse conditions , was correct in accent and fairly cultured .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 15]: Before the world had hardened it its tones might have been soft and dulcet .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 30]: But above all , there was the presumable discovery that Eileen Garth was as decidedly opposed as Robert Fenley to full and free discussion of that morning 's crime .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 27]: `` Furneaux will jeer at me when he hears of this little episode , '' thought Winter , smiling as he turned to descend the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 14]: Furneaux did jeer , but it was at his colleague 's phenomenal luck .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 5]: The door of No .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 18]: Twelve , the only other flat on the same landing , opened , and a man appeared .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 8]: Recognition was prompt on Winter 's side .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 6]: `` Hello , Drake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 4]: he said genially .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 8]: `` Are _ you _ Signor Maselli ?
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 5]: Well met , anyhow !
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 9]: Can you give me a friendly word ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 6]: The occupant of flat No .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 22]: Twelve , an undersized , slightly built man of middle age , seemed to have received the shock of his life .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 20]: His sallow-complexioned face assumed a greenish-yellow tint , and his deep-set eyes glistened like those of a hunted animal .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 4]: `` Friendly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 31]: he contrived to gasp , giving a ghastly look over his shoulder to ascertain whether any one in the interior of the flat had heard that name `` Drake . ''
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 4]: I mean it .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 18]: Strictly on the q. t. , '' said Winter , sinking his voice to a confidential pitch .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 14]: Signor Giovanni Maselli , since that was the name modestly displayed on No .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 13]: Twelve 's card in the hall beneath , closed the door carefully .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 20]: He appeared to trust Winter , up to a point , but evidently found it hard to regain self-control .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 5]: `` Not here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 3]: he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 12]: `` In five minutes -- at the Regency Caf√© , Piccadilly .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 6]: Let me go alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 9]: Winter nodded , and the other darted downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 5]: The detective followed slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 18]: Crossing the street at an angle , he looked up at the smoke-stained elevation of Gloucester Mansions .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 25]: `` A well-filled nest , '' he communed , `` and a nice lot of prize birds in it , upon my word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 54]: The last time he had set eyes on a certain notably expert forger and counterfeiter a judge was passing sentence of five years ' penal servitude and three years ' police supervision on a felon ; and the judge had not addressed the prisoner as Giovanni Maselli , but as John Christopher Drake !
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 15]: CHAPTER VIII COINCIDENCES Winter was blessed with an unfailing memory for dates and faces .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 55]: Before he had emerged from the main exit of Gloucester Mansions he had fixed Drake as committed from the Old Bailey during the Summer assizes four years earlier , released from Portland on ticket of leave at the beginning of the current year , and marked in the `` failure to report '' list .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 5]: `` Poor devil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 5]: he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 9]: `` The very man for my purpose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 30]: Therefore , seeing his way clearly , his glance was not so encouraging nor his voice so pleasant when he found the ex-convict awaiting him in the Regency Caf√© .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 36]: Nevertheless , obeying the curious code which links the police and noted criminals in a sort of _ camaraderie _ , he asked the man what he would drink , and ordered cigarettes as well .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 41]: `` Now , Maselli , '' he said , when they were seated at a marble-topped table in a corner of a well-filled room , `` since we know each other so well we can converse plainly , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 12]: `` Yes , sir , but I 'm done for now .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 23]: I 've been trying to earn an honest living , and have succeeded , but now -- '' The man spoke brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 5]: His spirit was crushed .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 30]: He saw in his mind 's eye the frowning portals of a convict settlement , and heard the boom of a giant knocker reverberating through gaunt aisles of despair .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 34]: `` If you reflect that I am calling you Maselli , you 'll drink that whisky and soda , and listen to what I have to say , '' broke in Winter severely .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 17]: The other looked up at him , and a gleam of hope illumined the pallid cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 12]: He drank eagerly , and lighted a cigarette with trembling fingers .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 19]: `` If only I am given a chance -- '' he began , but the detective interfered again .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 9]: `` If only you would shut up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 4]: he said emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 25]: `` I want your help , and I 'm not in the habit of rewarding my assistants by sending them back to prison . ''
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 20]: Maselli -LRB- as he may remain in this record -RRB- was so excited that he literally could not obey .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 18]: `` I 've cut completely adrift from the old crowd , sir , '' he pleaded wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 12]: `` I 'm an engraver now , and in good work .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 10]: Heaven help me , I 'm married , too .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 5]: She does n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 27]: She thinks I was stranded in America , and that I changed my name because Italians are thought more of than Englishmen in my line . ''
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 14]: `` Giovanni Maselli , may I ask what you are talking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 6]: said Winter , stiffening visibly .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 19]: At last the hunted and haunted wretch persuaded himself that `` the Yard '' meant to be merciful .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 17]: Tears glistened in his eyes , but he finished the whisky and soda and remained silent .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 4]: `` Good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 5]: said Winter more cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 15]: `` I sha 'n' t call you Maselli again if you do n't behave .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 12]: Now , how long have you lived in Gloucester Mansions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 6]: `` Four months , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 6]: Ever since my marriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 3]: Winter smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 19]: The man had gone straight from the gates of Portland to some woman who was waiting for him !
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 28]: He was an old offender , but had proved slippery as an eel -- hence a stiff sentence when caught ; but penal servitude had conquered him .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 9]: `` Has Miss Eileen Garth lived in No .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 7]: Eleven during those four months ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 5]: was the next question .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 13]: `` Yes , sir -- two years or more , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 13]: Her mother mentioned something of it to my wife one day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 4]: `` Her mother ?
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 4]: Same name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 7]: `` Yes , Mrs. Garth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 7]: `` How do they live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 28]: `` The daughter was learning to be a stage dancer ; but they 've come into a settled income , and that idea is given up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 6]: `` Any male relations ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 9]: `` None that I know of , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 7]: Eileen is engaged to be married .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 19]: I have n't heard the gentleman 's name , but I 've seen him scores of times . ''
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 10]: `` Scores of times -- in four months ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 11]: `` Yes , sir , every second or third day .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 33]: That is , I either meet him or know he is there because Mrs. Maselli and Mrs. Garth are friendly , and there is constant coming and going across the landing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 38]: `` Is he a man of about thirty , middle height , lanky black hair , smooth dark face , sunken eyes , high cheek bones -- rather , shall I say , Italian in appearance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 8]: Maselli was surprised , and showed it .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 17]: `` Why , sir , you 've described him to a nicety , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 22]: Next time he is there to your absolute knowledge , slip out and telephone the fact to me at Scotland Yard .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 11]: If I 'm not in , ask for Mr. Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 6]: You remember Mr. Furneaux ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 7]: A sickly smile admitted the acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 30]: Furneaux had recognized the same artist 's hand in each of many realistic forgeries , and it was this fact which led to the man 's capture and conviction .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 19]: `` If neither of us is at home , inquire for Mr. Sheldon , '' went on Winter .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 4]: `` Note him .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 7]: He 's a stranger to you .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 26]: If you fail to get hold of any of us , say simply that Signor Maselli would like to have a word at our convenience .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 5]: It will be understood .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 7]: We sha 'n' t bother you .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 30]: Give another call next time the visitor is in Mrs. Garth 's flat , and keep on doing this until you find one of the three on the line .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 25]: Do n't use the telephone in Shaftesbury Avenue near the Mansions , because the boy in charge there might be suspicious , and blab .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 4]: That is all .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 20]: You are not doing Mrs. Garth or her daughter an ill turn , so far as I can judge .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 5]: Keep a still tongue .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 20]: Silence on your part will meet with silence on mine ... Oh , dash it , have another drink !
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 6]: Where 's your nerve ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 6]: Signor Giovanni Maselli was crying .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 21]: A phantom had brushed close , but was passing ; nevertheless , its shadow had chilled him to the bone .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 35]: Winter walked back to Scotland Yard , and found that Sheldon had gone , leaving a note which read : `` Mr. Robert Fenley is at 104 , Hendon Road , Battersea Park . ''
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 20]: He was tempted to have a word with Furneaux , but forbore , and tackled some other departmental business .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 13]: It was a day fated , however , to evolve the unexpected .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 26]: About a quarter to four the telephone bell rang , and Maselli informed him that Miss Garth 's fianc√© had just arrived at Gloucester Mansions .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 7]: `` Excellent , '' said Winter .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 11]: `` In future , devote your energies to legitimate engraving .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 3]: Good-by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 20]: He rushed out and leaped into a taxi ; within five minutes he was at the door of No .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 4]: Eleven once more .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 26]: Let it not be imagined that he had not weighed the possible consequences of thrusting himself in this fashion into Hilton Fenley 's private affairs .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 35]: Although the man had summoned the assistance of Scotland Yard to elucidate the mystery of his father 's death , that fact alone could not secure him immunity from the law 's all-embracing glance .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 55]: Winter agreed with Furneaux that the profession of a private banker combined with company promotion is too often a cloak for roguery in the City of London , and the little he knew of the Fenley history did not tend to dissipate a certain nebulous suspicion that their record might not be wholly clean .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 29]: The theft of the bonds had been hushed up in a way that savored of unwillingness on Mortimer Fenley 's part to permit the police to take action .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 44]: The man 's tragic death might well be a sequel to the robbery , and , granted the impossibility of his elder son having committed the murder , there was nothing fantastic in the notion that he might be a party to it .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 21]: Again , Hilton Fenley had deliberately misled Scotland Yard in regard to the seemingly trivial incident of the telephone call .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 41]: Had he told the truth , and grumbled at the lack of discretion on some woman 's part in breaking in on a period of acute distress in the household , Winter 's subsequent discovery would have lost its point .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 67]: As matters stood , however , it was one of a large number of minor circumstances which demanded full examination , and the Superintendent decided that the person really responsible for any seeming excess of zeal on his part should be given an opportunity to clear the air in the place best fitted for the purpose ; namely , the address from which the call emanated .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 38]: Therefore , when the door was opened again by Mrs. Garth , she found that the Napoleonic tactics of an earlier hour were no longer practicable , for the enemy instantly occupied the terrain by leaning inward .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 14]: `` I want to see Mr. Hilton Fenley , '' he said suavely .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 18]: `` You know my name already , Mrs. Garth , so I need not repeat it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 8]: The sharp-featured woman was evidently sharp-witted also .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 14]: Finding that the door might not be closed , she threw it wide .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 15]: `` I have no objection to your seeing Mr. Fenley , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 24]: `` I am at a loss to understand why you follow him here , but that does not concern me in the least .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 5]: Come this way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 27]: Latching the door , she led him to a room on the right of the entrance hall , which formed the central artery of the flat .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 7]: The place had no direct daylight .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 48]: At night , when an electric lamp was switched on , its contents would be far more distinct than at this hour , when the only light came from a transverse passage at the end , or was borrowed through any door that happened to remain open .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 43]: Still , Winter could use his eyes , even in the momentary gloom , and he used them so well on this occasion that he noted two trunks , one on top of the other , and standing close to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 41]: They were well plastered with hotel and railway labels , and when a flood of light poured in from the room to which Mrs. Garth ushered him , he deciphered two of the freshest , and presumably the most recent .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 21]: They were `` Hotel d'Italie , Rue Caumartin , Paris , '' and a baggage number , `` 517 . ''
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 21]: Not much , perhaps , in the way of information , but something ; and Winter could trust his memory .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 37]: He found himself in a well-furnished room , and hoped that Mrs. Garth might leave him there , even for a few seconds , when he would be free to examine the apartment without her supervision .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 12]: But she treated him as if he might steal the spoons .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 13]: Remaining in the doorway , she called loudly : `` Mr. Fenley !
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 10]: The person I told you of is here again .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 5]: Will you kindly come ?
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 7]: He is in the dining-room . ''
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 18]: A door opened , a hurried step sounded on a linoleum floor-covering , and Hilton Fenley appeared .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 11]: `` Mr. -- Mr. Winter , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 10]: he said , with a fine air of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' said the Superintendent composedly .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 13]: `` You hardly expected to meet me here , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 28]: `` Well , Mrs. Garth mentioned your earlier visit , but I am at a loss to understand -- '' `` Oh , it is easily explained .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 12]: We of the Yard take nothing for granted , Mr. Fenley .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 45]: I learned by chance that a young lady who lives here rang you up at Roxton this morning , and knowing that you took the trouble to conceal the fact , I thought it advisable -- '' Mrs. Garth was a woman of discretion .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 9]: She closed the door on the two men .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 9]: Fenley did not wait for Winter to conclude .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 17]: `` That was foolish of me , I admit , '' he said , readily enough .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 19]: `` One does not wish all one 's private affairs to be canvassed , even by the police .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 12]: The moment Mrs. Garth mentioned your name I saw my error .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 21]: You checked the telephone calls to The Towers , I suppose , and thus learned I had misled you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 6]: `` Something of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 11]: Miss Garth is a lady not difficult of recognition . ''
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 10]: `` She and her mother are very dear friends .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 21]: It was natural they should be shocked by the paragraphs in the newspapers and wish to ascertain the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 4]: `` Quite so .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 14]: I 'm sorry if my pertinacity has annoyed them , or you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 15]: `` I think they will rather be pleased by such proof of your thoroughness .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 13]: Certainly I , for my part , do not resent it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 6]: `` Very well , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 24]: Since I am here , I may inquire if you know any one living at 104 , Hendon Road , Battersea Park ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 24]: `` Now that you mention the address , I recall it as the residence of the lady in whom my brother is interested .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 15]: This morning I had forgotten it , but you have refreshed my memory . ''
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 40]: `` You 're a tolerably self-possessed person , '' was the detective 's unspoken thought , for Fenley was a different man now from the nervous , distrait son who had clamored for vengeance on his father 's murderer .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 35]: `` You own up to the facts candidly when it is useless to do anything else , and you never fail to hammer a nail into Robert 's coffin when the opportunity offers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 20]: But aloud he said -- `` You really do n't know the lady 's name , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 8]: Fenley hesitated a fraction of a second .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 20]: `` Yes , I do know it , though I withheld the information this morning , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 21]: `` But , I ask you , is it quite fair to make me a witness against my brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 29]: `` Some one must explain Mr. Robert 's movements , and , since he declines the task , I look to you , '' was the straightforward answer .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 21]: `` She is a Mrs. Lisle , '' said Fenley , after another pause -- a calculated pause this time .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 10]: `` Have you visited your City office today ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 9]: `` I went straight there from The Towers .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 8]: I told you I was going there .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 10]: What object could I have in deceiving you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 10]: `` None that I can see , Mr. Fenley .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 23]: But I have been wondering if any new light has been shed on the motive which might have led to the crime .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 12]: Have you examined Mr. Mortimer Fenley 's papers , for instance ?
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 18]: There may be documents , letters , memoranda secreted in some private drawer or dispatch case . ''
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 6]: The other shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 10]: He appeared not to resent the detective 's tone .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 17]: It seemed as if regret for the morning 's lack of confidence had rendered him apologetic .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 7]: `` No , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 15]: `` I have not had time yet to go through my father 's papers .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 10]: This afternoon I was taken up wholly with business .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 37]: You see , Mr. Winter , I can not allow my personal suffering to cost other men thousands of pounds , and that must be the outcome if certain undertakings now in hand are not completed .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 18]: But my father was most methodical , and his affairs are sure to be thoroughly in order .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 21]: Within the next few days , when I have time to make a proper search , I 'll do it .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 28]: Meanwhile , I can practically assure you that he had no reason to anticipate anything in the nature of a personal attack from any quarter whatsoever . ''
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 13]: `` Do you care to discuss your brother 's extraordinary behavior ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 6]: `` In what respect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 22]: `` Well , he virtually bolted from Roxton today , though I had warned him that his presence was imperative . ''
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 20]: `` My brother is self-willed and impetuous , and he was dreadfully shocked at finding his father dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 14]: `` Did he tell you he meant returning to London at once ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 18]: When I came downstairs , after the distressing scene with Mrs. Fenley , he had gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 27]: The Superintendent was aware already that he was dealing with a man cast in no ordinary mold , but he did not expect this continued meekness .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 63]: Ninety-nine people out of a hundred would have grown restive under such cross-examination , and betrayed their annoyance by word or look ; not so Hilton Fenley , who behaved as if it were the most natural thing in the world that he should be tracked to his friends ' residence and made to explain his comings and goings during the day .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 18]: Swayed by a subconscious desire to nettle his victim into protest , Winter tried a new tack .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 17]: `` I suppose , Mr. Fenley , you have seen your father 's solicitors today ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 4]: he said suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 27]: `` If you mean that question in the ordinary sense , I must tell you that my father employed no firm of solicitors for family purposes .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 35]: Of course , at one time or another , he has availed himself of the services of nearly every leading firm of lawyers in the City , but each transaction was complete in itself .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 19]: For instance , his will is a holograph will , if that is what you are hinting at .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 29]: He told me its provisions at the time it was signed and witnessed , and I shall surely find it in his private safe at the office . ''
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 10]: `` You have not looked for it today ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 5]: Why should I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 39]: Feeling distinctly nonplussed , for there was no denying that Fenley had chosen the best possible way of carrying off a delicate situation , Winter turned , walked slowly to a window and gazed down into the street .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 22]: He was perturbed , almost irritated , by a novel sense of failure not often associated with the day 's work .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 33]: He had to confess now that he had made no material stride in an inquiry the solution of which did not seem , at the outset , to offer any abnormal difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 60]: True , there were circumstances which might serve to incriminate Robert Fenley ; but if that young man were really responsible for the crime , he was what `` the Yard '' classes privately as a monumental idiot , since his subsequent conduct was well calculated to arouse the suspicion which the instinct of self-preservation would try to avert .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 43]: A long experience of the methods of criminals warned Winter of the folly of jumping at conclusions , but he would be slow to admit and hard to be convinced that Robert Fenley took any active part in his father 's murder .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 20]: Of course , it was not with a view toward indulging in a reverie that he approached the window .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 17]: He was setting a simple trap , into which many a man and woman had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 43]: Any one of moderately strong character can control face and eyes when the need of such discipline is urgent , but howsoever impregnable the mask , the strain of wearing it is felt , and relief shows itself in an unguarded moment .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 43]: At the farther end of the room there was a mirror above the fireplace , and as he turned his back on Fenley , by a hardly perceptible inclination of his head he could catch the reflection of his companion 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 10]: The maneuver succeeded , but its result was negative .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 7]: Hilton Fenley 's eyes were downcast .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 25]: He had lifted a hand to his chin in one of those nervous gestures which had been so noticeable during the morning 's tumult .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 9]: His face wore an expression of deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 23]: Indeed , he might be weighing each word he had heard and uttered , and calculating its effect on his own fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 21]: Still obeying that unworthy instinct which bade him sting Fenley into defiance , Winter tossed a question over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 11]: `` May I have a word with Miss Garth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 4]: he said suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 5]: was the calm answer .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 13]: `` Just to settle that telephone incident once and for all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 23]: `` But if you imagine it might not have been Miss Garth who made the call , why are you here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 5]: Then the detective laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 14]: His wonted air of cheerful good humor smoothed the wrinkles from his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 28]: He was beaten , completely discomfited , and he might as well confess it and betake himself to some quarter where a likelier trail could be followed .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 8]: `` True , '' he said affably .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 9]: `` I need not bother the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 23]: Perhaps you will make my excuses and tell her that I ran you to earth in Gloucester Mansions merely to save time .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 39]: By the way , I led the youth at the call office to believe that I was searching for an undersized Polish Jewess , all nose and gold earrings , a description which hardly applies to Miss Garth .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 13]: And one last question -- do you return to Roxton tonight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 6]: `` Within the hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 18]: So Winter descended the stone stairs a second time , a prey to a feeling of failure .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 9]: What had he gained by his impetuous actions ?
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 20]: He had ascertained that Hilton Fenley was on terms of close intimacy with a pretty girl and her mother .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 6]: Nothing very remarkable in that .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 15]: He had secured a Paris address and the number of a baggage registration label .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 18]: But similar information might be gleaned from a hundred thousand boxes and portmanteaux in London that day .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 13]: He had been told that Mortimer Fenley had made a holograph will .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 8]: Such procedure was by no means rare .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 13]: Millions sterling have been disposed of on half sheets of note paper .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 33]: Even his Majesty 's judges have written similar wills , and blundered , with the result that a brother learned in the law has had to decide what the testator really meant .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 26]: He wondered whether or not Mortimer Fenley had committed some technical error , such as the common one of creating a trust without appointing trustees .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 14]: That would be seen in due course , when the will was probated .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 11]: At any rate , he grinned at his own expense .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 25]: `` The only individual who has scored today , '' he said to himself , `` is John Christopher Drake , alias Giovanni Maselli .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 7]: I must keep mum about him .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 12]: By gad , I believe I 've compounded a felony ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 25]: But because he had not scored inside Gloucester Mansions there was no valid reason why he should not accomplish something in their immediate neighborhood .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 14]: For instance , who and what were the Garths , mother and daughter ?
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 14]: He looked in on a well-known dramatic agent , and raised the point .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 58]: Reference to a ledger showed that Eileen Garth , age eighteen , tall , good-looking , no previous experience , had been a candidate for musical comedy , London engagement alone accepted ; the almost certain sequel being that she had kept her name six months on the books without an offer to secure her valuable services .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 12]: `` I remember the girl well , '' said the agent .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 13]: `` She had the makings of a coryph√©e , but lacked training .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 15]: She could sing a little , so I advised her to take dancing lessons .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 26]: I believe she began them , with a teacher I recommended , but I 've seen nothing of her for a year or more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 18]: `` Again has Giovanni filled the bill , '' mused Winter as he made for his office .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 23]: `` I wish now I had curbed my impulsiveness and kept away from Gloucester Mansions -- the second time , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 28]: Though chastened in spirit , the fact that no news of any sort awaited him at Scotland Yard , did not help to restore his customary poise .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 6]: `` Dash it all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 3]: he growled .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 6]: `` I 'm losing grip .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 24]: The next thing I 'll hear is that Sheldon is enjoying himself at Earl 's Court and that Furneaux has gone fishing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 16]: Restless and ill at ease , he decided to ring up The Towers , Roxton .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 18]: A footman answered the telephone , and announced that Mr. Furneaux had `` just come in . ''
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 18]: `` Hello , Charles , '' said Winter , when a thin voice squeaked along the line .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 5]: `` Any luck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 4]: `` Superb ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 3]: `` Good !
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 17]: I 've drawn blanks , regular round O 's , except three probably useless addresses . ''
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 8]: `` Addresses are never useless , friend .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 25]: The mere knowing of a number in a street picks out that street from all the other streets where one knows no numbers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 13]: `` Tell me things , you rat , if conditions permit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 13]: `` Well , I 've hit on two facts of profound importance .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 23]: First , Roxton contains an artist of rare genius , and , second , it holds a cook of admitted excellence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 22]: `` Look here -- '' `` I 'm listening here , which is all that science can achieve at present . ''
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 12]: `` I 'm in no mood for ill timed pleasantries . ''
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 12]: `` But I 'm not joking , ` pon me honor .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 21]: The cook , name of Eliza , does really exist , and is sworn to surprise even your jaded appetite .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 6]: The artist is John Trenholme .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 17]: In years to come you 'll boast of having met him before he was famous . ''
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 12]: `` So you , like me , have done nothing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 13]: `` Ah , I note the bitterness of defeat in your tone .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 27]: It has warped your judgment , too , as you will agree when a certain dinner I have arranged for tomorrow night touches the spot . ''
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 10]: `` Ca n't you put matters more plainly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 9]: `` I 'm guessing and planning and contriving .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 12]: Like Galileo , I am convinced that the world moves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 6]: Then Furneaux broke into French .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 13]: `` Regarding those addresses you speak of , what are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 59]: Using the same language , Winter told him , substituting `` the Eurasian '' and `` the motorcyclist '' for names , and adding that he was writing Jacques Faure , the Paris detective , with reference to the hotel and the label , the figures on the latter being of the long , thin , French variety .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 8]: `` Are you coming here tonight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 4]: went on Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 7]: `` Do you want me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 22]: `` I 'm only a little chap , and I 'd like to have you near when it is dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 9]: Winter sighed , but it was with relief .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 9]: He knew now that Furneaux had not failed .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 8]: `` Very well , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 11]: `` I 'll arrive by the next convenient train . ''
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 43]: `` The point is , '' continued Furneaux , who delighted in keeping his chief on tenterhooks when some new development in the chase was imminent , `` that the position here requires handling by a man of your weight and authority .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 21]: The motor cyclist came back an hour ago , and is now walking in the garden with the girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 4]: `` The deuce !
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 7]: Why has n't Sheldon reported ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 4]: blurted out Winter .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 14]: `` Because , in all likelihood , he is watching the other girl .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 8]: Is n't that what you were doing ?
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 13]: Is n't half the battle won when we find the woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 13]: `` I have n't set eyes on _ my _ woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 5]: `` You surprise me .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 24]: That kind of modest self-effacement is n't your usual style , at all , at all , as they say in Cork . ''
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 8]: `` Probably you 're right about Sheldon .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 18]: He is a worker , not a talker like some people I know , '' retorted Winter .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 9]: `` What very dull acquaintances you must possess !
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 26]: Workers are the small fry who put spouters into Parliament , and pay them # 400 a year , and make them Cabinet Ministers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 16]: `` Evidently things have happened at Roxton , or you would n't be so chirpy .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 5]: Well , so long !
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 5]: See you later . ''
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 29]: Having ascertained that an express train was timed to leave St. Pancras for Roxton at six P. M. , he was packing a suitcase when a telegram arrived .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 23]: It had been handed in at Folkestone at four thirty , and read : Decided to follow lady instead of motor cyclist .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 5]: Will explain reasons verbally .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 5]: Reaching London seven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 2]: SHELDON .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 21]: `` I 'm the only one of the three who has accomplished nothing , '' was Winter 's rueful comment .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 28]: Nor could any critic have gainsaid him , for he seemed to have been wasting precious hours while his subordinates were making history in the Fenley case .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 28]: He left instructions with Johnston that Mr. Sheldon was to write fully , care of the Roxton police station , and took a cab for St. Pancras .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 28]: He was passing along the platform when he caught sight of Hilton Fenley seated on the far side of a first-class carriage , which was otherwise untenanted .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 27]: An open dispatch box lay beside him , and he was so engrossed in the perusal of some document that he gave no heed to externals .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 9]: Winter threw wide the door , and entered .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 16]: `` We are fated to meet today , Mr. Fenley , '' he said pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 21]: `` First , you send for me ; then I hunt you , and now we come together by chance .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 18]: I do n't think coincidence can arrange any fourth way of bringing us in touch today . ''
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 5]: But he was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 59]: Coincidence had already done far more than he imagined in providing unseen clues to the ultimate clearing up of a ghastly crime , and the same subtle law of chance was fated to assist the authorities once more before the sun rose again over the trees from whose cover Mortimer Fenley 's murderer had fired the fatal shot .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 22]: CHAPTER IX WHEREIN AN ARTIST BECOMES A MAN OF ACTION Furneaux 's visit left Trenholme in no happy frame of mind .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 20]: The man who that morning had not a care in the world was now a prey to disquieting thought .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 67]: The knowledge that he had been close to the scene of a dastardly murder at the moment it was committed , that he was in a sense a witness of the crime , was depressing in itself , for his was a kindly nature ; and the mere fact that circumstances had rendered him impotent when his presence might have acted as a deterrent was saddening .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 54]: Then , again , he was worried by the reflection that , no matter how discriminating the police might prove with regard to his sketch of Sylvia Manning , he would undoubtedly be called as a witness , both at the inquest and at the trial of any person arrested for the crime .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 51]: It was asking too much of editorial human nature to expect that the magazine which had commissioned the illustrated article on Roxton would not make capital of the fact that its special artist was actually sketching the house while Mr. Fenley 's murderer was skulking among the trees surrounding it .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 9]: Thus there was no escape for John Trenholme .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 7]: He was doomed to become notorious .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 14]: At any hour the evening newspapers might be publishing his portrait and biography !
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 14]: On going downstairs he was cheered a little by meeting an apologetic Eliza .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 25]: `` I hope I did n't do any reel ` arm , sir , '' she said , dropping an aspirate in sheer emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 10]: `` Any harm to whom , or what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 15]: `` By talkin ' as I did afore that ` tec , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 10]: `` All depends on what you said to him .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 43]: If you told him , for instance , that I carry Browning pistols in each pocket , and that my easel is a portable Maxim gun , of course -- '' `` Oh , sir , I never try to be funny .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 7]: I mean about the picter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 4]: `` Good Heavens !
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 5]: You , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 16]: Eliza failed to understand this , but she was too subdued to inquire his meaning .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 27]: `` You see , sir , he must ha ' heerd what I said about it , an ' him skulkin ' there in the passage .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 18]: Do you reelly think a hop-o ' - me-thumb like that can be a Scotland Yard man ?
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 10]: It 's my belief he 's a himpostor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 22]: It had not dawned on Trenholme that Furneaux 's complete fund of information regarding the sketches had been obtained so recently .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 19]: He imagined that Police Constable Farrow and Gamekeeper Bates had supplied details , so his reply cheered Eliza .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 12]: `` Do n't worry about unnecessary trifles , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 16]: `` Mr. Furneaux is not only a genuine detective , but a remarkably clever one .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 13]: You ought to have heard him praising the picture you despised . ''
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 11]: `` I never did , '' came the vehement protest .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 6]: `` The picter is fine .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 21]: It was the young lady 's clothes , or the want of 'em , that I was condemnin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 19]: `` I 've seen four thousand ladies walking about the sands at Trouville in far scantier attire . ''
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 11]: `` That 's in France , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 3]: inquired Eliza .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 14]: `` Yes , but France is a more civilized country than England . ''
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 8]: Eliza sniffed , sure sign of battle .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 8]: `` Not it , '' she vowed .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 17]: `` I 've read things about the carryin ' on there as made me blood boil .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 16]: Horse-racin ' on Sundays , an ' folks goin ' to theaters instead of church .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 8]: France more civilized than England , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 9]: What 'll you be sayin ' next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 22]: `` I 'll be saying that if our little friend behaves himself I shall ask him to dine here tomorrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 35]: `` He 's axed himself , Mr. Trenholme , an ' he 's bringing another one , a big fellow , who knows how to use a carvin ' - knife , he says .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 8]: What would you like for dinner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 3]: Trenholme fled .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 8]: That question was becoming a daily torment .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 39]: The appearance of Furneaux had alone saved him from being put on the culinary rack after luncheon ; having partaken of one good meal , he never had the remotest notion as to his requirements for the next .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 21]: He wandered through the village , calling at a tobacconist 's , and looking in on his friend the barber .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 7]: All tongues were agog with wonder .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 24]: The Fenley family , known to that district of Hertfordshire during the greater part of a generation , was subjected to merciless criticism .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 34]: He heard gossip of Mr. Robert , of Mr. Hilton , even of the recluse wife , now a widow ; but every one had a good word for `` Miss Sylvia . ''
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 21]: `` We do n't see enough of her , an ' that 's a fact , '' said the barber .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 29]: `` She must find life rather dull , cooped up there as she is , for all that it 's a grand house an ' a fine park .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 10]: They never had company like the other big houses .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 32]: A few bald-headed City men an ' their wives for an occasional week end in the summer or when the coverts were shot in October -- never any nice young people .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 29]: Miss Sylvia wept when the rector 's daughter got married last year , an ' well I knew why -- she was losin ' her only chum . ''
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 13]: `` Surely there are scores of good families in this neighborhood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 10]: `` Plenty , sir , but nearly all county .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 34]: The toffs never did take on the Fenleys , an ' , to be fair , I do n't believe the poor man who 's dead ever bothered his head about them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 13]: `` But Miss Manning can not have lived here all her life ?
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 13]: She must have been abroad , at school , for instance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 7]: `` Well , yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 12]: I remember her comin ' home from Brussels two years ago .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 6]: But school ai n't society .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 18]: The likes of her , with all her money , should mix with her own sort . ''
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 9]: `` Is she so wealthy , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 35]: `` She 's Mr. Fenley 's ward , an ' the servants at The Towers say she 'll come in for a heap when she 's twenty-one , which will be next year . ''
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 15]: Somehow , this item of gossip , confirming Eliza 's statement , was displeasing .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 21]: Sylvia Manning , nymph of the lake , receded to some dim altitude where the high and mighty are enthroned .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 27]: Biting his pipe viciously , Trenholme sought the solitude of a woodland footpath , and tried to find distraction in studying the effects of diffused light .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 20]: Returning to the inn about tea time , he was angered anew by a telegram from the magazine editor .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 18]: It read : _ News in Pictures _ wants sketches and photographs of Fenley case and surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 6]: Have suggested you for commission .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 7]: Why not pick up a tenner ?
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 5]: Rush drawings by train .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 12]: `` That 's the last straw , '' growled Trenholme fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 34]: He raced out , bought a set of picture postcards showing the village and the Tudor mansion , and dispatched them to the editor of _ News in Pictures _ with his compliments .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 15]: Coming back from the station , he passed the Easton lodge of The Towers .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 16]: A daring notion seized him , and he proceeded to put it into practice forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 17]: He presented himself at the gate , and was faced by Mrs. Bates and a policeman .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 23]: Taught by experience to beware of strangers that day , the keeper 's wife gazed at him through an insurmountable iron palisade .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 18]: The constable merely surveyed him with a professional air , as one who would interfere if needful .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 14]: `` I am calling on Miss Sylvia Manning , '' announced Trenholme promptly .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 7]: `` By appointment , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 18]: `` No , but I have reason to believe that she would wish to see me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 20]: `` My orders are that nobody is to be admitted to the house without written instructions , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 16]: `` How can Miss Manning give written instructions unless she knows I am here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 12]: `` Them 's my orders , '' said Mrs. Bates firmly .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 33]: `` But , '' he persisted , `` it really amounts to this -- that you decide whether or not Miss Manning wishes to receive me , or any other visitor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 9]: Mrs. Bates found the point of view novel .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 10]: Moreover , she liked this young man 's smile .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 6]: She hesitated , and temporized .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 18]: `` If you do n't mind waitin ' a minute till I telephone -- '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 24]: Say that Mr. John Trenholme , who was sketching in the park this morning , asks the favor of a few words . ''
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 18]: The guardian of the gate disappeared ; soon she came out again , and unlocked the gate .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 14]: `` Miss Manning is just leavin ' the house , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 15]: `` If you walk up the avenue you 'll meet her , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 19]: Now , it happened that Trenholme 's request for an interview reached Sylvia Manning at a peculiar moment .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 14]: She had been shocked and distressed beyond measure by the morning 's tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 23]: Mortimer Fenley was one of those men whom riches render morose , but his manner had always been kind to his ward .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 45]: A pleasant fiction enabled the girl to regard Mr. and Mrs. Fenley as her `` uncle '' and `` aunt , '' and the tacit relationship thus established served to place the financier and his `` niece '' on a footing of affectionate intimacy .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 42]: Of late , however , Sylvia had been aware of a splitting up of the family into armed camps , and the discovery , or intuition , that she was the cause of the rupture had proved irksome and even annoying .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 17]: Mortimer Fenley had made no secret of his desire that she should marry his younger son .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 40]: When both young people , excellent friends though they were , seemed to shirk the suggestion , though by no means actively opposing it , Fenley was angered , and did not scruple to throw out hints of coercion .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 26]: Again , the girl knew that Hilton Fenley was a rival suitor , and meant to defy his father 's intent with regard to Robert .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 14]: Oddly enough , neither of the young men had indulged in overt love-making .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 16]: According to their reckoning , Sylvia 's personal choice counted for little in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 36]: Robert seemed to assume that his `` cousin '' was merely waiting to be asked , while Hilton 's attitude was that of a man biding his time to snatch a prize when opportunity served .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 9]: Sylvia herself hated the very thought of matrimony .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 37]: The only married couples of her acquaintance were either hopelessly detached , like Fenley and his wife , or uninteresting people of the type which the village barber had etched so clearly for Trenholme 's benefit .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 16]: Whatsoever quickening of romance might have crept into such lives had long yielded to atrophy .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 19]: Marriage , to the girl 's imaginative mind , was synonymous with a dull and prosy middle age .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 41]: Most certainly the vague day-dreams evoked by her reading of books and converted into alluring vistas by an ever-widening horizon were not sated by the prospect of becoming the wife of either of the only two young men she knew .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 12]: There was a big world beyond the confines of Roxton Park .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 11]: There were interests in life that called with increasing insistence .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 72]: In her heart of hearts she had decided , quite unmistakably , to decline any matrimonial project for several years , and while shrinking from a downright avowal of her intentions , which her `` uncle '' would have resented very strongly , the fact that father and sons were at daggers drawn concerning her was the cause of no slight feeling of dismay , even of occasional moments of unhappiness .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 8]: She had no one to confide in .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 61]: For reasons beyond her ken Mortimer Fenley had set his face against any of her school friends being invited to the house , while Mrs. Fenley , by reason of an unfortunate failing , was a wretched automaton that ate and drank and slept , and alternated between brief fits of delirium and prolonged periods of stupor induced by drugs .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 26]: Still , until a murderous gunshot had torn away the veil of unreality which enshrouded the household , Sylvia had contrived to avoid a crisis .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 18]: All day , during six days of the week , she was free in her own realm .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 20]: She had books and music , the woods , the park , and the gardens to occupy busy hours .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 28]: Unknown to any , her favorite amusement was the planning of extensive foreign tours by such simple means as an atlas and a set of guide books .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 31]: She had a talent for sketching in water color , and her own sanctum contained a dozen or more copious records of imaginary journeys illustrated with singular accuracy of detail .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 9]: She was athletic in her tastes , too .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 13]: She had fitted up a small gymnasium , which she used daily .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 34]: At her request , Mortimer Fenley had laid out a nine-hole links in the park , and in her second golfing year -LRB- the current one -RRB- Sylvia had gone around in bogey .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 40]: She would have excelled in tennis , but Robert Fenley was so much away from home that she seldom got a game , while Hilton professed to be too tired for strenuous exercise after long days in the City .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 30]: She could ride and drive , though forbidden to follow any of the local packs of fox-hounds , and it has been seen that she was a first-rate swimmer .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 25]: Brodie , too , had taught her to drive a motor car , and she could discourse learnedly on silencers and the Otto cycle .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 34]: On the whole , then , she was content , and hugged the conceit that when she came of age she would be her own mistress and order her life as she chose .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 24]: The solitary defect of any real importance in the scheme of things was Mortimer Fenley 's growing insistence on her marriage to Robert .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 30]: It was astounding , therefore , and quite bewildering , that Robert Fenley should have hit on the day of his father 's death to declare his prosaic passion .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 10]: He had motored back from London about four o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 30]: Hurrying to change his clothing for the attire demanded by convention in hours of mourning , he sent a message to Sylvia asking her to meet him at tea .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 21]: Afterwards he took her into the garden , on the pretext that she was looking pale and needed fresh air .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 28]: There , without the least preamble , he informed her that the day 's occurrences had caused him to fall in unreservedly with his father 's wishes .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 34]: He urged her to agree to a quiet wedding at the earliest possible date , and pointed out that a prompt announcement of their pact would stifle any opposition on Hilton 's part .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 20]: Evidently he took it for granted that if Barkis was willing , Peggotty had no option in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 11]: He forgot to mention such a trivial element as love .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 24]: Their marriage had been planned by the arbiter of their destinies , and who were they that they should gainsay that august decision ?
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 19]: Why , his father 's death had made it a duty that they owed to a sacred memory !
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 47]: Though Sylvia 's experience of the world was slight , and knowledge of her fellow creatures rather less , Cousin Robert 's eagerness , as compared with his deficiencies as a wooer , warned her that some hidden but powerful motive was egging him on now .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 17]: She tried to temporize , but the more she eluded him the more insistent he became .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 12]: At last , she spoke plainly , and with some heat .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 28]: `` If you press for my answer today it is ` No , ' '' she said , and a wave of color flooded her pale cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 11]: `` I think you can hardly have considered your actions .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 18]: It is monstrous to talk of marriage when my uncle has only been dead a few hours .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 9]: I refuse to listen to another word . ''
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 9]: Perforce , Robert had left it at that .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 32]: He had the sense to bottle up his anger , at any rate in her hearing ; perhaps he reflected that the breaking of the ice would facilitate the subsequent plunge .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 30]: Far more disturbed in spirit than her dignified repulse of Fenley had shown , Sylvia re√´ntered the house , passing the odd-looking little detective as she crossed the hall .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 25]: She took refuge in her own suite , but determined forthwith to go out of doors again and seek shelter among her beloved trees .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 29]: Through a window , as her rooms faced south , she saw Robert Fenley pacing moodily in the garden , where he was presently joined by the detective .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 38]: Apparently , Fenley was as ungracious and surly of manner as he knew how to be , but Furneaux continued to chat with careless affability ; soon the two walked off in the direction of the lake .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 6]: That was Sylvia 's chance .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 23]: She ran downstairs and was at the door when a footman came and said that Mrs. Bates wanted her on the telephone .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 10]: At first she was astounded by Trenholme 's message .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 38]: Then sheer irritation at the crassness of things , and perhaps some spice of feminine curiosity , led her to give the order which opened the gates of Roxton Park to a man she had never seen .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 11]: The two met a few hundred yards down the avenue .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 43]: Police Constable Farrow , who had been replaced by another constable while he went home for a meal , was on guard in the Quarry Wood again until the night men came on duty , and noticed Miss Manning leaving the house .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 41]: He descended from his rock and strolled toward the avenue , with no other motive than a desire to stretch his legs ; his perplexity was unbounded when he discovered Mortimer Fenley 's ward deep in conversation with the artist .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 8]: `` Well , I 'm jiggered ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 9]: he said , dodging behind a giant rhododendron .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 22]: Whipping out a notebook and consulting his watch , he solemnly noted time and names in a laboriously accurate round hand .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 14]: Then he nibbled his chin strap and dug both thumbs into his belt .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 7]: His luck was in that day .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 13]: He knew something now that was withheld from the Scotland Yard swells .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 8]: Sylvia Manning and John Trenholme were acquaintances .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 22]: Nay , more ; they must be old friends ; under his very eyes they went off together into the park .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 13]: Back to his rock went Police Constable Farrow , puzzled but elated .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 8]: Was he not a repository of secrets ?
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 13]: And that funny little detective had betaken himself in the opposite direction !
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 5]: Fate was kind indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 25]: He would have been still more surprised had Fate permitted him to be also an eavesdropper , if listeners ever do drop from eaves .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 15]: Sylvia was by no means flurried when she came face to face with Trenholme .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 13]: The female of the species invariably shows her superiority on such occasions .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 9]: Trenholme knew he was blushing and rather breathless .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 6]: Sylvia was cool and distant .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 10]: `` You are Mr. Trenholme , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 14]: she said , her blue eyes meeting his brown ones in calm scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' he said , trying desperately to collect his wits .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 22]: The well-balanced phrases conned while walking up the avenue had vanished in a hopeless blur at the instant they were needed .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 7]: His mind was in a whirl .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 10]: `` I am Miss Manning , '' she continued .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 49]: `` It is hardly possible to receive visitors at the house this afternoon , and as I happened to be coming out when Mrs. Bates telephoned from the lodge , I thought you would have no objection to telling me here why you wish to see me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 16]: `` I have come to apologize for my action this morning , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 5]: `` What action ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 18]: `` I sketched you without your knowledge , and , of course , without your permission . ''
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 5]: `` You sketched me ?
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 3]: Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 10]: `` When you were swimming in the lake . ''
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 7]: `` You did n't dare ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 4]: `` I did .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 22]: I 'm sorry now , though you inspired the best picture I have ever painted , or shall ever paint . ''
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 23]: For an instant Sylvia forgot her personal troubles in sheer wonderment , and a ghost of a smile brightened her white cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 27]: John Trenholme was a person who inspired confidence at sight , and her first definite emotion was one of surprise that he should look so disconsolate .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 11]: `` I really do n't understand , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 13]: `` The quality of your picture has no special interest for me .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 25]: What I fail to grasp is your motive in trespassing in a private park and watching me , or any lady , bathing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 22]: `` Put that way , my conduct needs correcting with a horsewhip ; but happily there are other points of view .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 28]: That is -- I mean -- Really , Miss Manning , I am absurdly tongue-tied , but I do beg of you to hear my explanation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 6]: `` Have you one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 8]: It might convince any one but you .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 31]: You will be a severe judge , and I hardly know how to find words to seek your forgiveness , but I -- I was the victim of circumstances . ''
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 10]: `` Please do n't regard me as a judge .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 12]: At present , I am trying to guess what happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 17]: Then John squared his shoulders and tackled the greatest difficulty he had grappled with for years .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 14]: `` The simple truth should at least sound convincing , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 19]: `` I came to Roxton three days ago on a commission to sketch the village and its environment .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 20]: This house and grounds are historical , and I applied for permission to visit them , but was refused .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 22]: By chance , I heard of a public footpath which crosses the park close to the lake -- '' Sylvia nodded .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 11]: She , too , had heard much of that footpath .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 14]: Its existence had annoyed Mortimer Fenley as long as she could remember anything .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 7]: That friendly little nod encouraged Trenholme .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 13]: His voice came under better control , and he contrived to smile .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 35]: `` I was told it was a bone of contention , '' he said , `` but that did n't trouble me a bit , since the right of way opened the forbidden area .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 7]: I meant no disturbance or intrusion .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 36]: I rose early this morning , and would have made my sketches and got away without seeing you if it were not for a delightful pair of wrought iron gates passed _ en route _ .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 9]: They detained me three quarters of an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 22]: Instead of reaching the clump of cedars at a quarter to seven or thereabouts , I arrived at half past seven .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 14]: `` I sketched the house and lawns and then turned to the lake .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 19]: When you appeared I imagined at first you were coming to pitch into me for entering your domain .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 41]: But , as I was partly hidden by some briers beneath the cedars , you never saw me , and , before I realized what was taking place , you threw off your wraps and were in the water . ''
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 3]: gasped Sylvia .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 28]: `` Now , I ask you to regard the situation impersonally , '' said Trenholme , sinking his eyes humbly to the ground and keeping them there .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 26]: `` I had either to reveal my presence and startle you greatly , or remain where I was and wait until you went off again .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 15]: `` Whether it was wise or not , I elected for the easier course .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 17]: I think I would act similarly if placed in the like predicament tomorrow or next day .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 28]: After all , there is nothing so very remarkable in a lady taking a morning swim that an involuntary onlooker should be shocked or scandalized by it .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 9]: You and I were strangers to each other .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 13]: Were we friends , we might have been swimming in company . ''
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 25]: Sylvia uttered some incoherent sound , but Trenholme , once launched in his recital , meant to persevere with it to the bitter end .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 21]: `` I still hold that I chose the more judicious way out of a difficult situation , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 14]: `` Had I left it at that , all would have been well .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 12]: But the woman tempted me , and I did eat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 17]: `` Indeed , the woman did nothing of the sort , '' came the vehement protest .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 8]: `` I speak in the artistic sense .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 28]: You can not imagine , you will never know , what an exquisite picture you and the statue of Aphrodite made when mirrored in that shining water .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 22]: I forgot every consideration but the call of art , which , when it is genuine , is irresistible , overwhelming .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 23]: Fearing only that you might take one plunge and go , I grabbed my palette and a canvas and began to work .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 18]: `` I used pure color , and painted as one reads of the fierce labor of genius .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 9]: For once in my life I was inspired .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 19]: I had caught an effect which I might have sought in vain during the remainder of my life .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 8]: I painted real flesh , real water .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 17]: Even the reeds and shrubs by the side of the lake were veritable glimpses of actuality .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 69]: Then , when I had given some species of immortality to a fleeting moment , you returned to the house , and I was left alone with a dream made permanent , a memory transfixed on canvas , a picture which would have created a sensation in the Salon -- '' `` Oh , surely , you would not exhibit me -- it -- '' breathed the girl .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 8]: `` No , '' he said grimly .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 8]: `` That conceit is dead and buried .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 52]: But I want you to realize that during those few minutes I was not John Trenholme , an artist struggling for foothold on the steep crags of the painter 's rock of endeavor , but a master of the craft gazing from some high pinnacle at a territory he had won .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 26]: If you know anything of painting , Miss Manning , you will go with me so far as to admit that my indiscretion was impersonal .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 32]: I , a poet who expressed his emotions in terms of color , was alone with Aphrodite and a nymph , on a June morning , in a leafy English park .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 12]: I do n't think I should be blamed , but envied .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 19]: I should not be confessing a fault , but claiming recognition as one favored of the gods . ''
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 17]: Trenholme was speaking in earnest now , and Sylvia thrilled to the music of his voice .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 37]: But if her heart throbbed and a strange fluttering made itself felt in her heart , her utterance , by force of repression , was so cold and unmoved that Trenholme became more downcast than ever .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 54]: `` I do paint a little , '' she said , `` and I can understand that the -- er -- statue and the lake offer a charming subject ; but I am still at a loss to know why you have thought fit to come here and tell me these things . ''
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 42]: `` It is my wretched task to make that clear , at least , '' he cried contritely , forcing himself to turn and look through the trees at a landscape now glowing in the mellow light of a declining sun .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 33]: `` When you had gone I sat there , working hard for a time , but finally yielding to the spell of an unexpected and , therefore , a most delightful romance .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 24]: A vision of rare beauty had come into my life and gone from it , all in the course of a magic hour .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 11]: Is it strange that I should linger in the shrine ?
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 19]: `` I was aroused by a gunshot , but little dreamed that grim Death was stalking through Fairyland .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 28]: Still , I came to my everyday senses , packed up my sketches and color box , and tramped off to Roxton , singing as I went .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 26]: Hours afterward , I learned of the tragedy which had taken place so near the place where I had snatched a glimpse of the Hesperides .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 14]: It was known that I had been in the park at the time .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 19]: I had met and spoken to Bates , your head keeper , and the local policeman , Farrow .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 23]: `` A detective came , a man named Furneaux ; a jolly clever chap , too , but a most disturbing reasoner .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 39]: He showed me that my drawings -- the one sketch , at any rate , which I held sacred -- would prove my sheet anchor when I was brought into the stormy waters of inquest and law courts .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 29]: It is obvious that every person who was in that locality at half past nine this morning must explain his or her presence beyond all doubt or questioning .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 27]: I shall be obliged to say , of course , that I was in the park fully two hours , from seven thirty A. M. onward .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 5]: What was I doing ?
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 2]: Painting .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 8]: Very well ; where is the result ?
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 14]: Is it such that any artist will testify that I was busily engaged ?
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 8]: Do n't you see , Miss Manning ?
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 27]: I must either produce that sketch or stand convicted of the mean offense you yourself imputed to me instantly when you heard of my whereabouts . ''
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 25]: `` Oh , I did n't really imply that , '' said Sylvia , and a new note of sympathy crept into her voice .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 33]: `` It would be horrid if -- if you could n't explain ; and -- it seems to me that the sketches -- you made more than one , did n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 9]: -- should be shown to the authorities . ''
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 12]: Trenholme 's face lit with gratitude because of her ready tact .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 20]: He was sorely impelled to leave matters on their present footing , but whipped himself to the final stage .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 12]: `` There is worse to come , '' he said miserably .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 4]: `` Goodness me !
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 9]: What else _ can _ there be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 34]: `` Mr Furneaux has asked me -- ordered me , in fact -- to meet you by the side of the lake tomorrow morning at a quarter past nine and bring the drawings .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 12]: Now you know why I have ventured to call this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 22]: I simply could not wait till I was brought before you like a collared thief with the loot in his possession .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 15]: I _ had _ to meet you without the intervention of a grinning policeman .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 35]: When you heard my plea I thought , I hoped , that you might incline to a less severe view than would be possible if the matter came to your notice without warning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 4]: He stopped abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 40]: A curiously introspective look had come into the girl 's eyes , for he had summoned up courage to glance at her again , and snatch one last impression of her winsome loveliness before she bade him be gone .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 12]: `` Where are you staying in Roxton , Mr. Trenholme ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 12]: The unexpected nature of the question almost took his breath away .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 11]: `` At the White Horse Inn , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 6]: She pointed across the park .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 15]: `` That farm there , Mr. Jackson 's , lies nearly opposite the inn .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 11]: I suppose the detective has not impounded your sketch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 16]: `` No , '' he murmured , quite at a loss to follow her intent .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 18]: `` Well , Mr. Jackson will let you go and come through his farmyard to oblige me .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 11]: It will be a short cut for you , too .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 22]: If you have no objection , I 'll walk with you to the boundary wall , which you can climb easily .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 24]: `` Then you might bring this debatable picture , and let me see it -- the others as well , if you wish .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 8]: Would n't that be a good idea ?
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 21]: I might n't get quite such a shock in the morning , when the detective man parades you before me .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 6]: It is not very late .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 13]: I have plenty of time to stroll that far before dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 12]: Hardly believing his ears , Trenholme walked off by her side .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 8]: No wonder Police Constable Farrow was surprised .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 39]: And still less room was there for wonder that Hilton Fenley , driving with Winter from the station , should shout an imperative order to Brodie to stop the car when he saw the couple in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 8]: `` Is n't that Miss Sylvia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 13]: he said harshly , well knowing there could be only one answer .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 10]: `` Yes , sir , '' said the chauffeur .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 9]: `` Who is the man with her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 15]: `` Mr. Trenholme , the artist , from the White Horse , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 6]: `` Are you sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 9]: I 've seen him several times hereabouts . ''
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 30]: Fenley was in a rare temper already , for Winter had told him Brother Robert was at home , a development on which he had by no means counted .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 8]: Now his sallow face darkened with anger .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 5]: `` Drive on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 20]: `` I gave orders , at your request , Mr Winter , that no strangers were to be admitted .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 12]: I must see to it that I am obeyed in future .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 19]: It is surprising , too , that the police are so remiss in such an important matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 8]: For once , Winter was perforce silent .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 11]: In his heart of hearts he blamed Detective Inspector Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 41]: CHAPTER X FURNEAUX STATES SOME FACTS AND CERTAIN FANCIES This record of a day remarkable beyond any other in the history of secluded Roxton might strike a more cheerful note if it followed the two young people across the park .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 33]: It is doubtful whether or not Sylvia Manning 's unpremeditated action in accompanying Trenholme was inspired by a sudden interest in art or by revolt against the tribulations which had befallen her .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 40]: Of course there is some probability that a full and true account of the conversation between man and maid as they walked the half mile to Jackson 's farm might throw a flood of light on this minor problem .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 29]: Be that as it may , stern necessity demands that the chronicle should revert for a time to the sayings and doings of the Fenleys and the detectives .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 19]: Despite a roundabout route , Furneaux had merely led Robert Fenley through the gardens to the Quarry Wood .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 12]: Somewhat to the detective 's surprise , the rock was unguarded .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 19]: The two were standing there , discussing the crime , when Police Constable Farrow returned to his post .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 46]: Furneaux said nothing -- for some reason he did not emphasize the fact to his companion that a sentry should have been found stationed there -- but a sharp glance at the policeman warned the latter that he ran considerable risk of a subsequent reprimand .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 12]: Conscious of rectitude , Farrow saluted , and produced his notebook .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 21]: `` I 've just made a memo of this , sir , '' he said , pointing to an entry .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 28]: Furneaux read : Miss Sylvia Manning left home 6.45 P. M. Met Mr. John Trenholme , artist , White Horse Inn , in avenue 6.47 P. M .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 24]: The two held close conversation , and went off together across park in direction of Roxton 6.54 P. M. Lady wore no hat .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 10]: Regarded incident as unusual , so observed exact times .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 23]: `` I note what the Inspector says , and will discuss the point later , '' said Furneaux , returning the book .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 4]: The policeman grinned .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 12]: As between Scotland Yard and himself a complete understanding was established .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 11]: `` Have the local police discovered anything of importance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 30]: inquired Fenley , who , now that his own affairs called for no immediate attention , seemed to give more heed to the manner of his father 's death .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 14]: At first , his manner to Furneaux had been churlish in the extreme .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 18]: Evidently he thought he could treat the representative of the Criminal Investigation Department just as he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 12]: At this moment he elected to be gruffly civil in tone .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 48]: `` They are making full inquiries , of course , '' replied the detective , `` but I think the investigation will be conducted in the main by my Department -- As I was saying , Mr. Fenley , undoubtedly the shot was fired from this locality .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 49]: Dr. Stern , who is an authority on bullet wounds , is convinced of that , even if there was no other evidence , such as the chauffeur 's and the artist 's I told you of , together with the impressions formed by Bates and others . ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 7]: `` Were there no footprints ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 12]: was the next question , and Fenley eyed the ground critically .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 13]: He deemed those Scotland Yard Johnnies thickheaded chaps , at the best .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 6]: `` None of any value .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 14]: Since ten o'clock , however , dozens of new ones have been made .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 19]: That is why the policeman is keeping an eye on the place -- chiefly to warn off intruders .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 8]: Shall we return to the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 20]: `` It 's a strange business , '' said Fenley , striding down the slope by Furneaux 's side .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 18]: `` Why in the world should any one want to shoot my poor old guv ` nor ?
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 23]: He was straight as a die , and I do n't know a soul who had any real grievance against him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 8]: Furneaux did not appear to be listening .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 19]: The two were approaching the patch of moist earth which bore the impress of Robert Fenley 's boots .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 35]: `` By the way , '' he said suddenly , `` are you aware that there is a sort of a theory that your father was shot by a rifle belonging to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 19]: roared the other , and it was hard to say whether rage or astonishment predominated in his voice .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 15]: `` Is that one of Hilton 's dodges to get me into trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 16]: `` But you do own an Express rifle , which you keep in your sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 6]: Where is it now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 9]: `` In the place where it always is .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 9]: Standing in a corner behind the bookcase . ''
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 12]: `` When did you see it last , Mr. Fenley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 8]: `` How the deuce do I know ?
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 15]: I give it a run through with an oiled rag about once a month .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 12]: It must be nearly a month since I cleaned it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 6]: `` It has gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 5]: `` Gone where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 7]: `` I wish I knew . ''
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 11]: `` But who the devil could have taken it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 19]: If ever a man was floundering in a morass of wrath and amazement it was this loud-voiced youngster .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 32]: He was a slow-witted lout , but the veriest dullard must have perceived that the disappearance of the weapon which presumably killed his father was a serious matter for its owner .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 30]: In order to grasp this new phase of the tragedy in its proper bearings he stood stock still , and gazed blankly into the serious face of the detective .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 7]: Furneaux knew he would do that .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 5]: It was a mannerism .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 18]: Some men can not think and move at the same moment , and Robert Fenley was one .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 27]: Naturally , young Fenley did not know that he was leaving a new set of footprints by the side of the others already attributed to him .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 10]: Having done that , he was no longer wanted .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 38]: `` We 'll solve every part of the puzzle in time , '' said Furneaux slowly , moistening his thin lips with his tongue as if he were about to taste another glass of rare old-vintage wine .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 20]: `` I mentioned the fact of the gun being missing to show you how unwise you were this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 17]: You should n't have bolted off as you did when Mr. Winter requested you to remain .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 81]: I have n't the least doubt , Mr. Fenley , that you can prove you were in London at the time the murder was committed , and during some days prior to it , but the police like these matters to be cleared up ; if I may give you a hint , you 'll tell the Superintendent that you regret your behavior , and show you mean what you say by giving him all the information he asks for .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 5]: Here he is now .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 18]: I hear Mr. Hilton 's car , and Mr. Winter is coming with him from town . ''
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 6]: `` Mr. Hilton 's car ?
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 9]: It 's no more his car than mine .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 19]: You mark my words , there will be trouble in the family if my brother starts bossing things .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 15]: He hates me , and would do me an ill turn if he could .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 12]: Was it Hilton who spread this story about my gun ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 4]: Rather the reverse .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 10]: He kept your name studiously out of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 7]: `` Who was it , then ?
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 8]: I have a right to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 12]: `` I fail to recollect just how the matter cropped up .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 31]: It was the direct outcome of the common observation of several persons who heard the report , and who were able to discriminate between one class of gun and another .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 15]: Anyhow , there is no occasion for you to squeal before you are hurt .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 8]: You acted like a fool this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 9]: Try and behave yourself more reputably now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 26]: The prophet Balaam was not more taken aback when rebuked by his ass than Robert Fenley when Furneaux turned and rent him in this fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 21]: Hitherto the detective 's manner had been mildness itself , so this change of front was all the more staggering .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 7]: `` Oh , I say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 5]: came the blustering protest .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 16]: `` I do n't allow any of you fellows to talk to me like that .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 21]: I -- '' `` You 'll hear worse in another second if you really annoy me , '' said Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 20]: `` Heretofore no one seems to have troubled to inform you what a special sort of idiot you are .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 58]: Though your last words to your father were a threat that you were inclined to shoot him and your precious self , when you saw him lying dead you thought of nothing but your own wretched follies , and bolted off to Hendon Road , Battersea , instead of remaining here and trying to help the police .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 17]: `` When I tell you your gun is missing you yelp about your brother 's animosity .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 22]: Before your father is laid in his grave you threaten to upset the household because your brother acts as its master .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 5]: Why should n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 12]: Are you fitted to take the reins or share his responsibility ?
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 38]: If you were at your right job , Robert Fenley , you 'd be carrying bricks and mortar in a hod ; for you have n't brains enough to lay a brick or use a trowel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 34]: The victim of this outburst thought that the little detective had gone mad , though the reference to Hendon Road had startled him , and a scared expression had come into his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 15]: `` Look here -- '' he began , but Furneaux checked him again instantly .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 21]: `` I 've looked at you long enough to sum you up as a sulky puppy , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 19]: `` If you had any sort of gumption you would realize that you occupy a singularly precarious position .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 34]: Were it not for the lucky accident that my colleague and I were on the spot this morning it is more than likely that the county police would have arrested you at sight .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 20]: Do n't give us any more trouble , or you 'll be left to stew in your own juice .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 10]: I have warned you , once and for all .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 24]: If you care to swallow your spleen and amend your manners , I shall try to believe you are more idiot than knave .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 12]: At present I am doubtful which way the balance tips . ''
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 16]: Furneaux stalked off rapidly , leaving the other to fume with indignation as he followed .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 26]: With his almost uncanny gift of imaginative reasoning , the Jersey man had guessed the purport of Fenley 's talk with Sylvia in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 35]: He had watched the two from a window of the dining-room , and had read correctly the girl 's ill-concealed scorn , not quite devoid of dread , as revealed by face and gesture .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 19]: To make sure , he waylaid her in the hall while she was hurrying to her own apartments .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 22]: Then he sauntered after Robert Fenley , and only bided his time to empty upon him the vials of his wrath .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 12]: He had taken the oaf 's measure with a nice exactitude .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 63]: To trounce him without frightening him also was only inviting a complaint to the Commissioner , but Furneaux was well aware that the longer Robert Fenley 's dull brain dwelt on the significance of that address in Battersea being known to the police , the less ready would he be to stir a hornets ' nest into activity by showing his resentment .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 14]: Obviously , Furneaux 's methods were not those advocated in the Police Manual .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 26]: Any other man who practiced them would risk dismissal , but the `` Little ` Un '' of the Yard was a law unto himself .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 63]: Meanwhile , he was hurrying after the `` Big ` Un , '' -LRB- such , it will be recalled , were the respective nicknames Furneaux and Winter had received in the Department -RRB- who had alighted from the car , and was listening to Hilton Fenley berating a servant for having permitted Trenholme to make known his presence to Miss Manning .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 15]: The man , however , protested that he had done nothing of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 22]: Miss Sylvia had been called to the lodge telephone , and the footman 's acquaintance with the facts went no farther .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 18]: Smothering his annoyance as best he could , Fenley rang up Mrs. Bates and asked for particulars .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 28]: When the woman explained what had happened , he rejoined Winter in the hall , paying no heed to Furneaux , who was entering at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 32]: `` That artist fellow who was trespassing in the park this morning -- if nothing worse is proved against him -- must have a superb cheek , '' he said angrily .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 24]: `` He actually had the impertinence to ask Miss Manning to meet him , no doubt offering some plausible yarn as an excuse .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 12]: I hope you 'll test his story thoroughly , Mr. Winter .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 24]: At the least , he should be forced to say what he was doing in these grounds at such an unusual hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 16]: `` He is putting himself right with Miss Manning now , '' broke in Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 8]: `` Putting himself right with Miss Manning ?
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 10]: What the deuce do you mean , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 26]: Fenley could snarl effectively when in the mood , and none might deny his present state of irritation , be the cause what it might .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 15]: `` That young lady is the only person to whom he owes an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 9]: He is giving it to her now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 9]: `` Will you kindly be more explicit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 19]: Furneaux glanced from his infuriated questioner to Winter , his face one note of mild interrogation and non-comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 21]: `` Really , Mr. Fenley , I have said the same thing in two different ways , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 22]: `` As a rule I contrive to be tolerably lucid in my remarks -- do n't I , Mr. Robert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 9]: for the younger Fenley had just come in .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 7]: `` What 's up now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 6]: was Robert 's non-committal answer .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 15]: For some reason his brother did not reply , but Furneaux suddenly grew voluble .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 30]: `` Of course , you have n't heard that an artist named Trenholme was painting near the lake this morning when your father was killed , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 14]: `` Fortunately , he was there before and after the shot was fired .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 17]: He can prove , almost to a yard , the locality where the murderer was concealed .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 21]: In fact , he is coming here tomorrow , at my request , to go over the ground with me .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 15]: `` An interesting feature of the affair is that Mr. Trenholme is a genius .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 7]: I have never seen better work .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 31]: One of his drawings , a water color , has all the brilliancy and light of a David Cox , but another , in oil , is a positive masterpiece .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 61]: It must have been done in a few minutes , because Miss Manning did not know he was sitting beneath the cedars , and it is unreasonable to suppose that she would preserve the same pose for any length of time -- sufficiently long , that is -- '' `` Did the bounder paint a picture of Sylvia bathing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 11]: broke in Robert , his red face purple with rage .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 22]: `` Allow me to remind you that you are speaking of a painter of transcendent merit , '' said Furneaux suavely .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 17]: `` When _ I _ meet him I 'll give him a damned good hiding . ''
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 10]: `` He 's rather tall and strongly built . ''
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 16]: `` I do n't care how big he is , I 'll down him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 20]: `` Oh , stop this pothouse talk , '' put in Hilton , giving the blusterer a contemptuous glance .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 10]: `` Mr. Furneaux , you seem primed with information .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 20]: Why should Mr. Trenholme , if that is his name , have the audacity to call on Miss Manning ?
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 33]: He might have the impudence to skulk among the shrubs and watch a lady bathing , but I fail to see any motive for his visit to The Towers this evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 5]: Furneaux shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 9]: Evidently the point did not appeal to him .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 16]: `` There is no set formula that expresses the artistic temperament , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 21]: `` The man who passes whole years in studying the nude is often endowed with a very high moral sense .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 39]: Mr. Trenholme , though carried away by enthusiasm this morning , may be consumed with remorse tonight if he imagines that the lady who formed the subject of his sketch is likely to be distressed because of it .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 8]: `` I fear I am to blame .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 10]: I stopped Mr. Trenholme from destroying the picture today .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 37]: He meant burning it , since he had the sense to realize that he would be summoned as a witness , not only at tomorrow 's inquest , but when the affair comes before the courts .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 21]: I was bound to point out that the drawings supplied his solitary excuse for being in the locality at all .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 41]: He saw that -- unwillingly , it is true , but with painful clearness -- so I assume that his visit to Miss Manning was expiatory , a sort of humble obeisance to a goddess whom he had offended unwittingly .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 30]: I assume , too , that his plea for mercy has not proved wholly unsuccessful or Miss Manning would not now be walking with him across the park . ''
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 3]: roared Robert .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 18]: He turned to the gaping footman , for the whole conversation had taken place in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 9]: `` Which way did Miss Sylvia go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 12]: `` Down the avenue , sir , '' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 23]: `` I saw Miss Sylvia meet the gentleman , and after some talk they went through the trees to the right . ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 4]: Robert raced off .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 39]: Winter , who had not interfered hitherto , because Furneaux always had a valid excuse for his indiscretions , made as if he would follow and restrain the younger Fenley ; but Furneaux caught his eye and winked .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 3]: That sufficed .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 39]: The Superintendent contented himself with gazing after Robert Fenley , who ran along the avenue until clear of the Quarry Wood , when he , too , plunged through the line of elms and was lost to sight .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 10]: Hilton watched his impetuous brother with a brooding underlook .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 34]: He still held in his hand a leather portfolio bulging with papers , some of which he had placed there when Winter opened the door of the railway coach in St. Pancras station .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 17]: The footman offered to relieve him of it , but was swept aside with a gesture .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 25]: `` I have never known Robert so excited and erratic in his movements as he has been today , '' he said at last .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 24]: `` I hope he will not engage in a vulgar quarrel with this Mr. Trenholme , especially in Miss Manning 's presence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 19]: Apparently he could not quite control his voice , in which a sense of unctuous amusement revealed itself .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 8]: Furneaux could not resist such an opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 16]: He had pierced Robert 's thick skin ; now he undertook a more delicate operation .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 14]: `` That would be doubly unfortunate , '' he said , chuckling quietly .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 47]: `` If I am any judge of men , Mr. Robert Fenley would meet more than his match in our artist friend , while he would certainly undo all the good effect of an earlier and most serious and convincing conversation with the young lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 6]: Hilton swung around on him .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 10]: `` When did my brother return from London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 6]: `` Shortly before five o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 15]: He and Miss Manning had tea together , and afterward strolled in the gardens .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 13]: I do n't wonder at any artist wishing to sketch Miss Manning ?
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 3]: Do you ?
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 21]: If I may be allowed to say it , I have never seen a more graceful and charming girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 22]: `` May I inquire if you have made any progress in the particular inquiry for which I brought you here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 5]: Hilton Fenley spoke savagely .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 12]: He meant to be offensive , since the innuendo was unmistakable .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 10]: Apparently Furneaux 's remarks had achieved some hypodermic effect .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 11]: `` Oh , yes , '' was the offhand answer .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 23]: `` I have every reason to believe that Mr. Winter and I will make an arrest without undue loss of time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 8]: `` I am glad to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 26]: Thus far your methods have not inspired the confidence I , as a member of the public , was inclined to repose in Scotland Yard .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 16]: I am going to my rooms now , and dine at a quarter to eight .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 16]: About nine o'clock I wish to go into matters thoroughly with Mr. Winter and you .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 32]: At present , I think it only fair to say that I am not satisfied with the measures , whatever they may be , you have seen fit to adopt . ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 23]: He seemed to await a retort , but none came , so he strode across the hall and hurried up the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 33]: Furneaux continued to gaze blankly down the long , straight avenue , nor did he utter a word till a door opened and closed on the first floor in the southeast corner .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 4]: Then he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 14]: `` Some people are very hard to please , '' he said plaintively .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 6]: Winter beckoned to the footman .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 17]: `` Do you mind asking Mr. Tomlinson if he can come here for a moment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 22]: When the man disappeared he muttered -- `` Why are you stroking everybody 's fur the wrong way , Charles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 7]: `` A useful simile , James .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 24]: If they resemble cats we may see sparks , and each of those young men has something of the tiger in him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 18]: `` But things have gone horribly wrong all day -- after a highly promising start , too .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 30]: I do n't see that we are any nearer laying hands on a murderer because we have unearthed various little scandals in the lives of Mortimer Fenley 's sons .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 13]: And what game are you playing with this artist , Trenholme ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 18]: `` The supremely interesting problem just now is the game which he is playing with Robert Fenley .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 35]: If that young ass attacks him he 'll get the licking he wants , and if you 're in any doubt about my pronouns -- '' `` Oh , dash you and your pronouns !
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 4]: Here 's Tomlinson .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 2]: Quick !
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 9]: Have you a plan of any sort ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 3]: `` Three !
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 9]: Three separate lines of attack , each deadly .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 15]: But there are folk whose mental equipment renders them incapable of understanding plain English .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 12]: Now , my friend Tomlinson will show you what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 21]: I 'll ask him a simple question , and he will give you a perfect example of a direct answer .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 15]: Tomlinson , can you tell me what the extrados of a voussoir is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 27]: `` No , Mr. Furneaux , I can not , '' said the butler , smiling at what he regarded as the little man 's humor .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 4]: cried Furneaux delightedly .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 7]: `` Ai n't I a prophet ?
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 9]: No evasions about Tomlinson , are there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 16]: `` I think you 're cracked , '' growled Winter , picking up his suitcase .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 18]: `` If I 'm to stay here tonight , I shall want a room of some sort .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 16]: Mr. Tomlinson , can you -- '' `` Share mine , '' broke in Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 8]: `` I 'm the quietest sleeper living .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 18]: Our friend here is sure to have at disposal a room with two beds in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 13]: `` The principal guest room is unoccupied , '' said the butler .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 6]: `` Where is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 12]: `` On the first floor , sir , facing south . ''
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 6]: `` Could n't be better .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 4]: The very thing .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 6]: Here comes my baggage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 28]: And the others saw a policeman bicycling up the avenue , with a small portmanteau balanced precariously between the handlebars and the front buttons of his tunic .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 13]: `` You gentlemen will dine in my room , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 10]: said Tomlinson , when he had escorted them upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 18]: `` We are not invited to the family circle , at any rate , '' said Winter .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 16]: `` Well , you will not suffer on that account , '' announced Tomlinson genially .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 28]: `` Of course , I shall not have the pleasure of sharing the meal with you , but dinner will be served at a quarter to eight .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 22]: Mr. Furneaux knows his way about the house , so , with your permission , I 'll leave you at present .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 19]: If you 're disengaged at nine thirty I 'll be glad to see you in my sanctum . ''
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 8]: `` Is n't he a gem ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 16]: cried Furneaux , when the door had closed , and he and Winter were alone .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 10]: Winter sat down on the side of a bed .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 12]: He was worried , and did not strive to hide it .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 33]: For the first time in his life he felt distrustful of himself , and he suspected , too , that Furneaux was only covering abject failure by a display of high spirits .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 10]: `` Why so pensive an attitude , James ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 5]: inquired the other softly .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 14]: `` Are you still wondering what the extrados of a voussoir is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 13]: `` I do n't care a tuppenny damn what it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 9]: `` But that 's where you 're wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 9]: That 's where you 're crass and pig-headed .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 36]: The extrados of a voussoir -- '' `` Oh , kill it , and let it die happy -- '' '' -- is the outer curve of a wedge-shaped stone used for building an arch .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 11]: Now , mark you , those are words of merit .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 15]: Wedge , arch -- wedges of fact which shall construct the arch of evidence .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 18]: We 'll have our man in the dock across that bridge before we are much older . ''
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 6]: `` Confound it , how ?
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 26]: He could n't be in his bedroom and in the Quarry Wood , four hundred yards away , at one and the same moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 15]: Furneaux gazed fixedly at his friend 's forehead , presumably the seat of reason .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 18]: `` Sometimes , James , you make me gasp with an amazed admiration , '' he cooed .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 6]: `` You do , really .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 22]: You arrive at the same conclusion as I , a thinker , without any semblance of thought process on your part .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 6]: How do you manage it !
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 7]: Is it through association with me ?
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 12]: You know , there 's such a thing as inductive electricity .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 24]: A current passing through a highly charged wire can excite another wire , even a common iron one , without actual contact . ''
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 37]: `` I 've had a rotten afternoon , and do n't feel up to your far-fetched jokes just now ; so if you have nothing to report , shut up , '' said the Superintendent crossly .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 22]: `` Then I 'll cheer your melancholy with a bit of real news brightened by imagination , '' answered Furneaux promptly .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 39]: `` Hilton Fenley could n't have fired the rifle himself , except by certain bizarre means which I shall lay before the court later ; but he planned and contrived the murder , down to the smallest detail .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 54]: He wore Brother Robert 's boots when available ; from appearances Brother Robert is now wearing the identical pair which made those footprints we saw , but I shall know in the morning , for that fiery young sprig obligingly left another well-marked set of prints in the same place twenty minutes ago .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 34]: When circumstances compelled Hilton to walk that way in his own boots , he slipped on two roughly made moccasins , which he burned last night , having no further use for them .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 12]: Therefore , he knew the murder would take place this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 47]: `` I 've secured shreds of the sacking out of which he made the pads to cover his feet ; and an under gardener remembers seeing Mr. Hilton making off with an empty potato sack one day last week , and wondering why he wanted it .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 26]: During some mornings recently Hilton Fenley breakfasted early and went out , but invariably had an excuse for not accompanying his father to the City .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 50]: He was then studying the details of the crime , making sure that an expert , armed with a modern rifle , could not possibly miss such a target as a man standing outside a doorway , and elevated above the ground level by some five feet or more .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 80]: `` No servant could possibly observe that Mr. Hilton was wearing Mr. Robert 's boots , because they do not differ greatly in size ; but luckily for us , a criminal always commits an error of some sort , and Hilton blundered badly when he made those careful imprints of his brother 's feet , as the weather has been fine recently , and the only mud in this locality lies in that hollow of the Quarry Wood .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 20]: It happens that some particles of that identical mud were imbedded in the carpet of Hilton Fenley 's sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 18]: I 'm sorry to have to say it , because the housemaid is a nice girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 6]: `` Never mind the housemaid .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 4]: Go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 23]: `` Exactly what the housemaid would remark if she heard me ; only she would giggle , and you look infernally serious .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 26]: Next item : Hilton Fenley , like most high-class scoundrels , has the nerves of a cat , with all a cat 's fiendish brutality .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 40]: He could plan and carry out a callous crime and lay a subtle trail which must lead to that cry baby , Robert , but he was unable to control his emotions when he saw his father 's corpse .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 9]: That is where the murderer nearly always fails .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 15]: He can never picture in death that which he hated and doomed in life .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 13]: There is an element in death -- '' `` Chuck it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 4]: said Winter unfeelingly .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 10]: Furneaux winced , and affected to be deeply hurt .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 23]: `` The worst feature of service in Scotland Yard is its demoralizing effect on the finer sentiments , '' he said sadly .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 14]: `` Men lose all human instincts when they become detectives or newspaper reporters .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 9]: Now the ordinary policeman ofttimes remains quite soft-hearted .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 33]: For instance , Police Constable Farrow , though preening himself on being the pivot on which this case revolves , was much affected by Hilton Fenley 's first heart-broken words to him .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 26]: ` Poor young gentleman , ' said Farrow , when we were discussing the affair this afternoon , ` he was cut up somethink orful .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 19]: I did n't think he had it in him , s ` elp me , I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 8]: Tole me to act for the best .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 16]: Said some one had fired a bullet which nearly tore his father to pieces . '
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 25]: `` There was more of the same sort of thing , and I got Farrow to jot down the very words in his notebook .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 28]: Of course , he does n't guess why ... Now , I wonder how Hilton Fenley knew the effect of that bullet on his father 's body .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 6]: The doctor had not arrived .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 16]: There had been only a superficial examination by Tomlinson of the orifice of the wound .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 17]: What other mind in Roxton would picture to itself the havoc caused by an expanding bullet ?
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 17]: The man who uttered those words _ knew _ what sort of bullet had been used .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 14]: He _ knew _ it would tear his father 's body to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 32]: A neurotic imagination was at work , and that cry of horror was the soul 's unconscious protest against the very fiendishness of its own deed ... `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 20]: Let these Fenleys quarrel about that girl , and we 'll see Hilton marching steadily toward the Old Bailey .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 8]: Of course , we 'll assist him .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 14]: We 'll make certain he does n't deviate or falter on the road .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 37]: But he 'll follow it , and of his own accord ; and the first long stride will be taken when he goes to the Quarry Wood to retrieve the rifle which lies hidden there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 4]: Winter whistled softly .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 7]: Then he looked at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 4]: `` By Jove !
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 9]: Turned half past seven , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 4]: `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 3]: cackled Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 6]: `` James is himself again .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 36]: We have hardly a scrap of evidence , but that does n't trouble our worthy Superintendent a little bit , and he 'll enjoy his dinner far better than he thought possible ten minutes ago .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 6]: _ Sacr√© nom d'une pipe !
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 26]: _ By the time you 've tasted a bottle from Tomlinson 's favorite bin you 'll be preparing a brief for the Treasury solicitor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 49]: CHAPTER XI SOME PRELIMINARY SKIRMISHING Now , perhaps , taking advantage of an interval while the representatives of Scotland Yard sought the aid of soap and water as a preliminary to a meal , it is permissible to wander in the gloaming with Sylvia Manning and her escort .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 14]: To speak of the gloaming is a poetic license , it is true .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 29]: Seven o'clock on a fine summer evening in England is still broad daylight , but daylight of a quality that lends itself admirably to the exigencies of romance .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 10]: There is a species of dreaminess in the air .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 11]: The landscape assumes soft tints unknown to a fiery sun .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 7]: Tender shadows steal from undiscovered realms .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 16]: It is permissible to believe that every night on Parnassus is a night in June .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 17]: At first these two young people were at a loss to know what to talk about .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 30]: By tacit consent they ignored the morning 's tragedy , yet they might not indulge in the irresponsible chatter which would have provided a ready resource under normal conditions .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 10]: Luckily Trenholme remembered that the girl said she painted .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 19]: `` It is a relief to find that you also are of the elect , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 14]: `` An artist will look at my pictures with the artist 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 13]: There are other sorts of eyes -- Eliza 's , for instance .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 11]: Do you know Eliza , of the White Horse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 9]: Sylvia collected her wits , which were wool-gathering .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 18]: `` I think I have met her at village bazaars and tea fights , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 10]: `` Is she a stout , red-faced woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 23]: `` Both , to excess ; but her chief attribute is her tongue , which has solved the secret of perpetual motion .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 54]: Had it kept silent even for a few seconds at lunch time today , that sharp-eyed and rabbit-eared detective would never have known of the second picture -- your picture -- because I can eke out my exhibits by a half finished sketch of the lake and a pencil note of the gates .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 36]: But putting the bits of the puzzle together afterwards , I came to the conclusion that Mary , our kitchen maid , passed my room , saw the picture on the easel and was scandalized .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 25]: She of course told Eliza , who went to be shocked on her own account , and then came downstairs and pitched into me .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 11]: At that moment the Scotland Yard man turned up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 11]: `` Is it so very -- dreadful , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 3]: `` Dreadful !
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 50]: It may fall far short of the standard set by my own vanity ; but given any sort of skill in the painter , how can a charming study of a girl in a bathing costume , standing by the side of a statue of Aphrodite , be dreadful ?
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 23]: Of course , Miss Manning , you can hardly understand the way in which a certain section of the public regards art .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 13]: In studio jargon we call it the ` Oh , ma ! '
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 16]: crowd , that being the favorite exclamation of the young ladies who peep and condemn .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 23]: These people are the hopeless Philistines who argue about the sex of angels , and demand that nude statues shall be draped .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 8]: But my picture must speak for itself .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 8]: Tell me something about your own work .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 8]: Are you taking up painting seriously ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 23]: Now , to be candid , Sylvia herself was not wholly emancipated from the state of Philistinism which Trenholme was railing at .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 71]: Had he been less eager to secure a favorable verdict , or even less agitated by the unlooked-for condescension she was showing , he would have seen the absurdity of classing a girl of twenty with the lovers of art for art 's sake , those earnest-eyed enthusiasts who regard a perfect curve or an inimitable flesh tint as of vastly greater importance than the squeamishness of the young person .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 20]: Painters have their limitations as well as Mrs. Grundy , and John Trenholme did not suffer a fool gladly .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 37]: Sylvia , however , had the good sense to realize that she was listening to a man whose finer instincts had never been trammeled by conventions which might be wholesome in an academy for young ladies .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 24]: Certainly she wondered what sort of figure she cut in this much debated picture , but that interesting point would be determined shortly .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 17]: Meanwhile she answered demurely enough : `` I 'm afraid you have taken me too seriously .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 29]: I have hardly progressed beyond the stage where one discovers , with a sort of gasp , that trees may be blue or red , and skies green .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 31]: Though I am going to look at your pictures , Mr. Trenholme , it by no means follows that I shall ever dare to show you any of mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 17]: `` Still , I think you must have the artistic soul , '' he said thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 14]: `` There was more than mere physical delight in your swimming this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 22]: You reveled in the sunlight , in the golden air , in the scents of trees and shrubs and flowering grass .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 37]: First-rate swimmer as you are , you would not have enjoyed that dip half as much if it were taken in a covered bath , where your eyes dwelt only on white tiles and dressing-booths . ''
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 32]: The girl , subtly aware of a new element in life , was alarmed by its piercing sweetness , and with ruthless logic brought their talk back to a commonplace level .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 21]: `` Roxton seems to be a rather quaint place to find you in , Mr. Trenholme , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 10]: `` How did you happen on our tiny village ?
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 12]: Though so far from London , we are quite a byway .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 9]: Why did you pay us a visit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 22]: So Trenholme dropped to earth again , and they spoke of matters of slight import till the boundary wall was reached .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 22]: Sylvia hailed a man attending cattle in the farmyard , and the artist vaulted the wall , which was breast high .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 9]: The girl wondered if she could do that .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 7]: When opportunity served she would try .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 23]: Resting her elbows on the coping-stones , she watched Trenholme as he hurried away among the buildings and made for the village .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 16]: She had never before met such a man or any one even remotely like him .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 14]: He differed essentially from the Fenleys , greatly as the brothers themselves differed .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 34]: Without conscious effort to please , he had qualities that appealed strongly to women , and Sylvia knew now that no consideration would induce her to marry either of her `` cousins . ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 28]: If asked to put her thought into words , she would have boggled at the task , for intuition is not to be defined in set speech .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 27]: In her own way , she had summed up the characteristics of the two men with one of whom marriage had been at least a possibility .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 22]: Hilton she feared and Robert she despised , so if either was to become her husband , it would be Hilton .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 29]: But five minutes of John Trenholme 's companionship had given her a standard by which to measure her suitors , and both fell wofully short of its demands .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 23]: She saw with startling clearness of vision that Hilton , the schemer , and Robert , the wastrel , led selfish lives .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 23]: Souls they must possess , but souls starved by lack of spirituality , souls pent in dun prisons of their own contriving .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 38]: She was so lost in thought , thought that strayed from crystal-bright imageries to nebulous shapes at once dark and terrifying , that the first intimation she received of Robert Fenley 's approach was his stertorous breathing .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 20]: From a rapid walk he had broken into a jog trot when he saw Trenholme vanish over the wall .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 54]: Of late he seldom walked or rode a horse , and he was slightly out of condition , so his heavy face was flushed and perspiring , and his utterance somewhat labored when the girl turned at his cry : `` I say , Sylvia -- you 've given me such a chase !
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 16]: Who the deuce is that fellow , an ' what are you doing here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 8]: Robert had appeared at an inauspicious moment .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 8]: Sylvia eyed him with a new disfavor .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 11]: He was decidedly gross , both in manner and language .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 11]: She was sure he could not have vaulted the wall .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 27]: `` I 'm not aware that I called for any chasing on your part , '' she said , with an aloofness perilously akin to disdain .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 10]: He halted , panting , and eyed her sulkily .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 8]: `` No , but dash it all !
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 33]: You ca n't go walking around with any rotten outsider who forces himself into your company , '' was the most amiable reply he could frame on the spur of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 18]: `` You are short of breath , '' she said , smiling in a curiously impersonal way .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 7]: `` Run back to the house .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 7]: It will do you good . ''
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 4]: `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 5]: You run with me .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 28]: The first gong will go any minute , and we 've got to eat , you know , even though the pater _ is _ dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 6]: It was an unhappy allusion .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 3]: Sylvia stiffened .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 20]: `` My poor uncle 's death did not seem to trouble you greatly this morning , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 6]: `` Kindly leave me now .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 5]: I 'll follow soon .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 16]: I am waiting for Mr. Trenholme , who wants to show me some sketches . ''
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 13]: `` A nice time to look at sketches , upon my word !
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 12]: And who 's Trenholme , I 'd like to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 4]: Sylvia bethought herself .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 14]: Certainly an explanation was needful , and her feminine wit supplied one instantly .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 21]: `` Mr. Trenholme was sent here by the Scotland Yard people , '' she said , a trifle less frigidly .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 38]: `` I suppose we shall all be mixed up in the inquiry the detectives are holding , and it seems that Mr. Trenholme was at work in the park this morning when that awful affair took place .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 39]: Unknown to me , I was near the spot where he was sketching before breakfast , and one of the detectives , the little one , says it is important that -- that the fact should be proved .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 10]: Mr. Trenholme called to tell me just what happened .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 31]: So you see there is nothing in his action that should annoy any one -- you least of any , since you were away from home at the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 11]: `` But why has he mizzled over the wall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 19]: `` He is staying at the White Horse Inn , and has gone to fetch the drawings . ''
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 8]: `` Oh , I did n't understand .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 13]: If that 's it , I 'll wait till he turns up .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 9]: You 'll soon get rid of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 29]: Sylvia had no valid reason to urge against this decision , but she did not desire Robert 's company , and chose a feminine method of resenting it .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 19]: `` I do n't think Mr. Trenholme will be anxious to meet you , '' she said coolly .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 13]: `` You are such a transparent person in your likes and dislikes .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 38]: You have never even seen him , in the ordinary sense of the word , yet you speak of him in a way so unwarranted , so ridiculously untrue , that your manner might annoy him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 6]: `` My manner , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 6]: Is he so precious then ?
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 15]: By gad , it 'll be interesting to look this rare bird over . ''
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 13]: She turned her back on him and leaned on the wall again .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 14]: Her slight , lissome figure acquired a new elegance from her black dress .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 15]: Robert had never set eyes on Sylvia in such a costume before that day .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 41]: Hitherto she had been a schoolgirl , a flapper , a straight-limbed , boyish young person in long frocks ; but today she seemed to have put on a new air of womanliness , and he found it strangely attractive .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 25]: `` There 's no sense in our quarreling about the chap anyhow , '' he said with a gruff attempt to smooth away difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 15]: `` Of course , I sh ` a n't let on I followed you .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 18]: Just spotted you in the distance and joined you by chance , do n't you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 5]: Sylvia did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 21]: She was comparing Robert Fenley 's conversational style with John Trenholme 's , and the comparison was unflattering to Robert .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 12]: So he , too , came and leaned on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 17]: `` I 'm sorry if I annoyed you just now , Syl , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 9]: `` That dashed little detective is to blame .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 12]: He does put things in such a beastly unpleasant way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 5]: `` What things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 12]: `` Why , about you and me and all of us .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 14]: Gave me a regular lecture because I went back to town this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 9]: I could n't help it , old girl .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 5]: I really could n't .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 15]: I had to settle some urgent business , but that 's all ended now .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 8]: The pater 's death has steadied me .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 9]: No more gallivanting off to London for me .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 27]: Settle down in Roxton , Board of Guardians on Saturdays , church on Sunday , tea and tennis at the vicarage , and ` you-come-to-our-place-tomorrow . '
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 13]: You know the sort of thing -- old-fashioned , respectable and comfy .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 11]: I 'll sell my motor bike and start a car .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 15]: Motor bikes make a fellow a bit of a vagabond -- eh , what ?
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 8]: They _ will _ go the pace .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 6]: You ca n't stop 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 16]: Fifty per , and be hanged to the police , that 's their motto . ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 67]: `` It sounds idyllic , '' the girl forced herself to say lightly , but her teeth met with a snap , and her fingers gripped the rough surface of the stones , for she remembered how Trenholme had said of her that she `` reveled in the sunlight , in the golden air , in the scents of trees and shrubs and flowering grasses . ''
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 38]: There was a musical cadence in her voice that restored Robert 's surly good humor ; he was of that peculiar type of spoiled youth whose laugh is a guffaw and whose mirth ever holds a snarl .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 11]: `` Here comes your paint slinger , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 11]: `` Wonder if he really can stage a decent picture .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 18]: If so , when the present fuss is ended we 'll get him to do a group .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 23]: You and me and the keepers and dogs in front of the Warren Covert , next October , after a big drive .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 6]: How would that be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 11]: `` I 'm sure Mr. Trenholme will feel flattered . ''
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 20]: When Trenholme approached he was not too well pleased to find Miss Manning in charge of a new cavalier .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 14]: From items gathered earlier in the village he guessed the newcomer 's identity .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 25]: Perhaps he expected that the girl would offer an introduction , but she only smiled pleasantly and said : `` You must have hurried .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 13]: I do hope I have n't put you to any inconvenience ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 26]: `` Eliza informed me that she had just popped my chicken in the oven , so there is plenty of time , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 15]: `` I suppose it makes one hot to be constantly popping things into ovens .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 13]: In the course of years one should become a sort of salamander .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 18]: Have you ever read the autobiography of that great artist and very complete rascal , Benvenuto Cellini ?
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 34]: He is the last person reputed to have seen a real salamander in the fire , and he only remembered the fact because his father beat him lest he should forget it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 5]: `` Ben who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 5]: broke in Robert cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 5]: `` Benvenuto Cellini . ''
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 14]: `` Never heard of him ... Well , let 's have a peep-o .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 11]: Miss Manning and I dine at a quarter to eight .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 14]: You 've been taking some snapshots in the park , I 'm told .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 38]: If they 've got any ginger in them -- '' `` Probably you will describe them as hot stuff , '' said Trenholme , laying a portfolio on the wall in front of Sylvia and opening it .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 19]: `` This is a pencil drawing of the great gates , '' he went on , ignoring Fenley .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 13]: `` Of course , they 're Wren 's , and therefore beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 13]: Roxton Park holds a real treasure in those gates , Miss Manning .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 11]: Here is a water-color sketch of the house and grounds .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 6]: Do you like it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 7]: `` Oh , it is exquisite !
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 28]: Why , you have caught the very glint of sunshine on the walls and roofs , and it is shimmering in the leaves of that copper beech .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 3]: Ah me !
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 6]: It looks so easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 6]: Robert peered over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 15]: Sylvia 's gasp of admiration annoyed him ; but he looked and said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 16]: `` This , '' continued Trenholme , `` is an unfinished study of the lake .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 21]: I was so busily occupied that I was not aware of your presence until you were quite near at hand .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 17]: Then when you dived into the water I grabbed a canvas and some tubes of paint .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 20]: Here is the result -- completed , to a large extent , in my room at the inn . ''
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 30]: He took a picture out of a compartment of the portfolio specially constructed to protect an undried surface , and placed it at an angle that suited the light .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 15]: His tone was unconcerned , for he had steeled himself against this crucial moment .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 5]: Would she be angered ?
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 21]: Would those limpid blue eyes , violet now in shadow , be raised to his in protest and vexed dismay ?
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 33]: During the brief walk to and from the inn he had recollected the girl 's age , her surroundings , the cramping influences of existence in a society of middle-class City folk .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 29]: He felt like a prisoner awaiting a verdict when the issue was doubtful , and a wave of impulse might sway the jury one way or the other .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 28]: But he held his head high , and his face flushed slightly , for there could be no gainsaying the message glowing from that cunning brush work .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 14]: There were two goddesses , one in marble and one palpitating with life .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 8]: The likeness , too , was undeniable .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 19]: If one was a replica of Greek art at its zenith , the other was unmistakably Sylvia Manning .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 7]: The girl gazed long and earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 32]: Her pale cheeks had reddened for an instant , but the flood of surprise and emotion ebbed as quickly as it flowed , and left her wan , with parted lips .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 9]: At last she looked at Trenholme and spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 5]: `` Thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 8]: she said , and their eyes met .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 12]: The artist understood ; and he in turn , blanched somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 10]: Rather hastily he replaced the picture in its receptacle .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 12]: Robert Fenley coughed and grinned , and the spell was broken .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 14]: `` You said I 'd call it hot stuff , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 46]: `` Well , you sized my opinion up to a T. Of course , it 's jolly clever -- any fellow can see that -- '' `` Good night , Mr. Trenholme , '' said Sylvia , and she made off at a rapid pace .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 4]: Robert grinned again .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 15]: `` No young lady would stand that sort of thing , '' he chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 13]: `` You did n't really think she would -- eh , what ?
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 9]: But look here , I 'll buy it .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 7]: Send me a line later . ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 10]: He hurried after Sylvia , running to overtake her .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 22]: Trenholme stood there a long time ; in fact , until the two were hidden by the distant line of trees .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 4]: Then he smiled .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 16]: `` So you are Robert Fenley , '' he communed , packing the portfolio leisurely .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 60]: `` Well , if Sylvia Manning marries you , I 'll be a bachelor all my days , for I 'll never dare imagine I know anything about a woman 's soul ; though I 'm prepared at this hour of grace to stake my career that that girl 's soul is worthy of her very perfect body . ''
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 14]: Puffing a good deal , Fenley contrived to overhaul his `` cousin . ''
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 17]: `` By jing , Sylvia , you can step out a bit , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 9]: `` And you change your mind mighty quick .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 28]: Five minutes ago you were ready to wait any length of time till that Johnny turned up , and now you 're doing more than five per .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 5]: What 's the rush ?
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 15]: It 's only half past seven , and we do n't dress tonight . ''
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 11]: `` I 'm not dining downstairs , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 15]: `` Oh , I say , I ca n't stand Hilton all alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 37]: `` Nor can I stand either of you , '' she was tempted to retort , but contented herself by saying that she had arranged for a meal to be served in her aunt 's room .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 26]: Grumble and growl as he might , Robert could not shake her resolve ; he was in a vile temper when he reached the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 21]: His brother had not arrived , so he braced himself for an ordeal by drinking a stiff whisky and soda .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 15]: When Hilton came in the pair nodded to each other but ate in silence .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 8]: At last Robert glanced up at Tomlinson .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 16]: `` Just shove the stuff on the table and clear out , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 6]: `` We 'll help ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 12]: Mr. Hilton and I want to have a quiet talk . ''
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 11]: Hilton gave him a quick underlook but did not interfere .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 18]: Perhaps purposely , when the servants had left the room he opened the battle with a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 18]: `` I hope you did n't make a fool of yourself this evening , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 5]: `` As how ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 26]: queried Robert , wondrously subdued to all appearance , though aching to give the other what he called `` a bit of his mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 17]: `` I understand you made after Sylvia and the artist , meaning to chastise somebody . ''
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 10]: `` You were wrong , '' said Robert slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 6]: `` You nearly always are .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 11]: I make mistakes myself , but I own up handsomely .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 4]: You do n't .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 9]: That 's where we differ , see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 16]: `` I see differences , '' and Hilton helped himself to a glass of claret .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 24]: `` Trenholme , the artist Johnny , is a clever chap -- slightly cracked , as they all are , but dashed clever .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 15]: By gad , you ought to see the picture he 's painted of Sylvia .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 9]: Anyhow , you _ will _ see it .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 6]: I 've bought it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 4]: `` Really ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 11]: `` I said I 'd buy it -- same thing .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 7]: He 'll jump at the offer .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 7]: It 'll hang in my dressing-room .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 18]: I do n't suppose Sylvia will kick about a trifle like that when we 're married . ''
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 11]: Hilton was holding the glass of wine to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 16]: His hand shook , and he spilled a little , but he drank the remainder .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 10]: `` When did you decide to marry Sylvia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 18]: he inquired , after a pause which might have been needed to gain control of his voice .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 23]: `` It 's been decided for a long time , '' said Robert doggedly , himself showing some signs of enforced restraint .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 12]: `` It was the pater 's wish , as you know .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 21]: I 'm sorry now I did n't fix matters before he died ; but ` better late than never . '
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 16]: I asked Sylvia today , and we 've arranged to get married quite soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 11]: `` Are you by any chance telling the truth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 9]: `` What the blazes do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 9]: and Robert 's fist pounded the table heavily .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 6]: `` Exactly what I say .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 14]: You say that you and Sylvia have arranged to get married quite soon .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 5]: Those were your words .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 5]: Is that true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 10]: `` Confound you , of course it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 9]: `` Sylvia has actually agreed to that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 5]: `` I asked her .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 7]: What more do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 11]: `` I am merely inquiring civilly what she said . ''
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 11]: `` Dash it , you know what girls are like .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 4]: You ought to .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 11]: Is n't Eileen Garth a bit coy at times ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 12]: `` One might remark that Mrs. Lisle also was coy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 16]: `` Look here -- '' began the other furiously , but the other checked him .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 33]: `` Let us stop bickering like a couple of counter jumpers , '' he said , and a shrewder man than Robert might have been warned by the slow , incisive utterance .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 26]: `` You make an astonishing announcement on an occasion when it might least be expected , yet resent any doubt being thrown on its accuracy .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 9]: Did or did not Sylvia accept you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 32]: `` Well , she said something about not wishing to talk of marriage so soon after the old man 's death , but that was just her way of putting it .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 32]: I mean to marry her ; and when a fellow has made up his mind on a thing like that it 's best to say so and have done with it .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 13]: Sylvia 's a jolly nice girl , and has plenty of tin .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 16]: I 'm first in the field , so I 'm warning off any other candidates .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 3]: See ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 17]: `` Yes , I see , '' said Hilton , pouring out another glass of wine .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 14]: This time his hand was quite steady , and he drank without mishap .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 11]: `` Ai n't you going to wish me luck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 7]: said Robert , eying him viciously .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 6]: `` I agree with Sylvia .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 24]: The day we have lost our father is hardly a fitting time for such a discussion ; or shall I say ceremony ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 10]: `` You can say what the devil you like .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 8]: And you can do what you like .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 14]: Only keep off my corns and I wo n't tread on yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 52]: Having , as he fancied , struck a decisive blow in the struggle for that rare prize , Sylvia , Robert Fenley pushed back his chair , arose , waited a second for an answer which came not , and strode out , muttering something about being `` fed up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 14]: Hilton 's face was lowered , and one nervous hand shaded his brows .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 20]: Robert thought he had scored , but he could not see the inhuman rage blazing in those hidden eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 45]: The discovery , had he made it , might not have distressed him , but he would surely have been puzzled by the strange smile which wrinkled Hilton 's sallow cheeks when the door closed and the Eurasian was left alone in the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 26]: CHAPTER XII WHEREIN SCOTLAND YARD IS DINED AND WINED Three dinners for two were in progress in The Towers at one and the same hour .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 16]: One feast had been shortened by the ill-concealed hatred of each brother for the other .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 33]: At the second , brooding care found unwonted lodging in the charming personality of Sylvia Manning -- care , almost foreboding , heightened by the demented mutterings of her `` aunt . ''
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 30]: At the third , with the detectives , sat responsibility ; but light-heartedly withal , since these seasoned man-hunters could cast off their day 's work like a garment .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 28]: The first and second meals were of the high quality associated with English country houses of a superior class ; the third was a spread for epicures .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 5]: Tomlinson saw to that .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 16]: He was catering for a gourmet in Furneaux , and rose to the requisite height .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 10]: The little man sighed as he tasted the soup .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 7]: `` What is it now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 20]: inquired Winter , whose glance was dwelling appreciatively on a dusty bottle labeled `` Clos Vosgeot , 1879 . ''
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 29]: `` I hate eating the food of a man whom I mean to produce as a star turn at the Old Bailey , '' was the despondent answer .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 16]: `` So do I , if it comes to that , '' said Winter briskly .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 11]: `` But this appetizing menu comes out of another larder .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 19]: I shall be vastly mistaken if we 're not actually the guests of a certain pretty young lady .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 14]: Finance of the Fenley order is not in good odor in the City .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 8]: `` Have no scruples , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 52]: We may be vultures at the feast ; but before we see the end of the Fenley case there 'll be a smash in Bishopsgate Street , and Miss Sylvia Manning will be lucky if some sharp lawyer is able to grab some part of the wreckage for her benefit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 9]: `` Clear logic , at any rate . ''
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 5]: And Furneaux brightened visibly .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 11]: `` I 'll tell you what it 's based on .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 12]: Our swarthy friend was examining lists of securities in the train .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 30]: He did n't lift his head quickly enough -- took me for a ticket puncher , I expect -- so I had time to twig what he was doing .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 16]: I 'd like to run my eye over the papers in that leather portfolio . ''
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 6]: `` You may manage it .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 7]: You 're the luckiest fellow breathing .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 6]: Such opportunities come your way .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 9]: _ I _ have to make them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 17]: After an interlude played by sole Colbert , Winter shot an amused question at his companion .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 19]: `` What 's at the back of your head with regard to the artist and Miss Sylvia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 12]: `` It 's high time she spoke to a real man .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 9]: These Fenleys are animals , all of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 12]: John Trenholme is a genius , and a good-looking one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 22]: `` I met the girl in a corridor a while ago , and she was rather disconsolate , I thought . ''
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 6]: `` And with good reason .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 9]: You 've noticed how each brother eyes her .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 11]: They 'll fight like jackals before this night is out .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 13]: I hope Sylvia will indulge in what women call a good cry .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 8]: That will be Trenholme 's golden hour .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 32]: Some Frenchman -- of course he was clever , being French -- says that a man should beware when a woman smiles but he may dare all when she weeps . ''
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 9]: `` Are we marriage brokers , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 13]: `` We must set the Fenleys at each other 's throats . ''
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 31]: `` Yes , '' mused Winter aloud , when a _ ris de veau bonne maman _ had passed like a dream , `` this affair is becoming decidedly interesting .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 11]: But every why hath a wherefore , according to Shakespeare .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 25]: Tell me '' -- and his voice sank to a whisper -- `` tell me why you believe Hilton Fenley killed his father . ''
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 11]: `` You nosed your way into that problem this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 17]: Between his mother and that girl , Eileen Garth , he was in a tight place .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 5]: He stole those bonds .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 13]: I fancied it at the time , but I know it now .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 36]: They were negotiated in Paris by a woman who occupied a room in the Hotel d'Italie , Rue Caumartin , Paris , and one of her registered boxes bore the rail number , 517 . ''
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 6]: `` You little devil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 4]: blazed out Winter .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 13]: `` And you never said a word when I told you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 7]: `` Astonishment has rendered you incoherent .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 29]: You mean , of course , when you told me you had seen in Gloucester Mansions a box labeled in accordance with the facts I have just retailed .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 7]: But I yield that minor point .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 10]: It is a purist 's , at the best .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 18]: I have supplied a motive , one motive , for the crime ; the plotter feared discovery .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 7]: But there are dozens of others .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 11]: He was impatient of the old man 's rigid control .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 15]: Hilton is sharp and shrewd , and he guessed things were going wrong financially .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 30]: He knew that his father 's methods were out of date , and believed he could straighten the tangle if the reins of power were not withheld too long .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 30]: `` He saw that Sylvia Manning 's gold was in the melting-pot , and appreciated precisely the cause of the elder Fenley 's anxiety that she should marry Robert .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 37]: Once in the family , you know , her fortunes were bound up with theirs ; while any ` cute lawyer could dish her in the marriage settlements if sufficiently well paid for a nasty job .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 34]: When Sylvia was Mrs. Robert Fenley , and perhaps mother of a squalling Fenley , the head of the business could face the future if not with confidence , at least with safety .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 7]: But where would Hilton be then ?
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 16]: The girl lost , the money in jeopardy , and he himself steadily elbowed out .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 5]: _ ` Cr√© nom !
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 12]: _ I 've known men murdered for less convincing reasons . ''
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 9]: `` Men , yes ; not fathers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 9]: `` Some sons are the offspring of Beelzebub .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 7]: Consider the parentage in this instance .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 24]: Fenley , a groom and horse coper on the one hand , and the dark daughter of a Calcutta merchant on the other .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 17]: If the progeny of such a union escaped a hereditary taint it would be a miracle .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 13]: Cremate Hilton Fenley and his very dust will contain evil germs . ''
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 12]: `` You 're strong in theory but weak in proof . ''
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 8]: That style of argument invariably nettled Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 29]: `` You must butt into a few more mysterious suites of apartments in London and elsewhere , and you 'll supply proof in bucketfuls , '' he snapped .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 7]: `` But was there an accomplice ?
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 31]: Squirm as you like , you ca n't get over the fact that Hilton was in his room when the bullet that killed his father came from the wood . ''
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 27]: `` He is not the sort of person likely to trust his liberty , his life even , to the keeping of any other human being .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 40]: I start from the hypothesis that he alone planned and carried out the crime , so I do not lift my hand and cry ` Impossible , ' but I ask myself , ` How was it done ? '
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 24]: Well , there are several methods worthy of consideration -- clockwork , electricity , even a time fuse attached to the proper mechanism .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 29]: I have n't really bothered myself yet to determine the means , because when that knowledge becomes indispensable we must have our man under lock and key . ''
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 17]: `` Of course , the rifle is securely fixed in that -- '' The door opened .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 7]: Tomlinson came in , smiling blandly .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 13]: `` I hope you are enjoying your dinner , gentlemen both ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 13]: `` You have made your cook an artist , '' said Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 18]: `` I suppose you are happier here than in a big London restaurant , '' said Winter .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 12]: The butler appreciated such subtle compliments , and beamed on them .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 21]: `` With a little encouragement and advice , our chef can prepare a very eatable dinner , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 54]: `` As for my own ambitions , I have had them , like every man worth his salt ; but I fill a comfortable chair here -- no worry , no grumbling , not a soul to say _ nem _ or _ con _ , so long as things go smoothly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 35]: `` It must have been _ nem _ all the time , '' giggled Furneaux , and Winter was so afflicted by a desire to sneeze that he buried his face in a napkin .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 8]: `` And how was the wine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 12]: went on Tomlinson , with an eye on the little man .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 10]: Furneaux 's features were crinkled in a Japanese smile .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 13]: He wanted to kick Winter , who was quivering with suppressed laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 22]: `` I never expected to find such vintages in a house of the _ mauvais riches _ , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 31]: `` Perhaps you do n't speak French , Mr. Tomlinson , so allow me to explain that I am alluding to men of wealth not born in the purple . ''
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 5]: `` Precisely -- self-made .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 16]: Well sir , poor Mr. Fenley left the stocking of his cellar entirely to me .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 7]: I gave the matter much thought .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 44]: When my knowledge was at fault I consulted experts , and the result -- '' `` That is the result , '' cried Furneaux , seizing the empty claret bottle , and planting it so firmly on the table that the cutlery danced .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 38]: A shoulder of lamb , served _ √† la Soubise _ , appeared ; and Tomlinson , announcing that his presence in the dining-room had been dispensed with , thought he would join them in a snack .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 23]: Being a hospitable creature , he opened another bottle of the Clos Vosgeot , but his guests were not to be tempted .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 20]: `` Well , then , '' he said , `` in a few minutes you must try our port .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 17]: It is not Alto Douro , Mr. Furneaux , but it has body and bowket . ''
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 7]: Winter was better prepared this time .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 31]: Moreover he was carving , and aware of a master 's criticism , and there are occult problems connected with even such a simple joint as a shoulder of lamb .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 8]: Furneaux , too , was momentarily subdued .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 20]: He seemed to be reflecting sadly that statues of gold , silver and bronze may have feet of clay .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 23]: `` I have often thought , gentlemen , '' said the butler , `` that yours must be a most interesting profession .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 12]: You meet all sorts and conditions of men and women . ''
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 12]: `` We consort with the noblest malefactors , '' agreed Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 13]: `` Dear me , sir , you do use the queerest words .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 14]: Now , I should never dream of describing a criminal as noble . ''
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 10]: `` Not in the generally accepted sense , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 34]: But you , I take it , have not had the opportunity of attending a really remarkable trial , when , say , some intellectual giant among murderers is fighting for his life .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 13]: Believe me , no drama of the stage can rival that tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 25]: `` The chief actor , remote , solitary , fenced away from the world he is hoping to re√´nter , sits there in state .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 27]: Every eye is on him , yet he faces judge , jury , counsel , witnesses and audience with a calm dignity worthy of an emperor .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 30]: He listens imperturbably to facts which may hang him , to lies which may lend color to the facts , to well-meaning guesses which are wide of the mark .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 20]: Truthful and false evidence is equally prone to err when guilt or innocence must be determined by circumstances alone .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 8]: `` But the prisoner _ knows _ .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 39]: He is the one man able to discriminate between truth and falsity , yet he must not reveal the cruel stab of fact or the harmless buffet of fiction by so much as a flicker of an eyelid .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 26]: He surveys the honest blunderer and the perjured ruffian -- I mean the counsel for the defense and the prosecution respectively -- with impartial scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 44]: If he is a sublime villain , he will call on Heaven to testify that he is innocent with a solemnity not surpassed by the judge who sentences him to death ... Yes , please , a bit off the knuckle end . ''
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 24]: The concluding words were addressed to Winter , and Tomlinson started , for he was wrapped up in the scene Furneaux was depicting .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 15]: `` That point of view had not occurred to me , '' he admitted .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 21]: `` You 'll appreciate it fully when you see Mr. Fenley 's murderer in the dock , '' said Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 5]: `` Ah , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 8]: That brings your illustration home , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 10]: But shall we ever know who killed him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 14]: Look at that high dome of intelligence glistening at you across the table .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 40]: But that it is forbid to tell the secrets of the prison house , it could a tale unfold whose slightest word would harrow up thy soul -- '' Harris , the footman , entered , carrying a decanter .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 16]: `` Mr. Hilton Fenley 's compliments , gentlemen , and will you try this port ?
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 16]: He says Mr. Tomlinson will recommend it , because Mr. Fenley himself seldom takes wine .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 13]: Mr. Fenley will not trouble you to meet him again this evening .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 12]: Mr. Tomlinson , Mr. Fenley wants you for a moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 4]: The butler rose .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 14]: `` That is the very wine I spoke of , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 16]: `` If Mr. Hilton did not touch it , Mr. Robert evidently appreciated it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 19]: He glanced at Harris , but the footman did not even suspect that his character was at stake .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 17]: The decanter was nearly full when placed on the sideboard ; now it was half empty .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 19]: Singularly enough , both Winter and Furneaux had intercepted that questioning glance , and had acquitted Harris simultaneously .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 10]: `` Are the gentlemen still in the dining-room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 3]: inquired Winter .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 18]: `` Mr. Hilton is there , sir , but Mr. Robert went out some time since . ''
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 9]: `` Please convey our thanks to Mr. Hilton .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 10]: I 'm sure we shall enjoy the wine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 15]: When Tomlinson and Harris had gone , the eyes of the two detectives met .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 26]: They said nothing at first , and it may be remembered that they were reputedly most dangerous to a pursued criminal when working together silently .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 19]: Winter took the decanter , poured out a small quantity into two glasses , and gave Furneaux one .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 13]: Then they smelled , and tasted , and examined the wine critically .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 19]: The rich red liquid might have been a poisonous decoction for the care they devoted to its analysis .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 3]: Furneaux began .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 23]: `` I have so many sleepless nights that I recognize bromide , no matter how it is disguised , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 13]: `` Comparatively harmless , though a strong dose , '' said Winter .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 31]: `` If one has to swallow twenty grains or so of potassium bromide I can not conceive any pleasanter way of taking them than mixed with a sound port . ''
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 16]: Winter filled one of the glasses four times , pouring each amount into a tumbler .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 19]: Furneaux looked into a cupboard , and found an empty beer bottle , which he rinsed with water .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 34]: Meanwhile Winter was fashioning a funnel out of a torn envelope , and in a few seconds the tumblerful of wine was in the bottle , and the bottle in Winter 's pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 27]: This done , the big man lit a cigar and the little one sniffed the smoke , which was his peculiar way of enjoying the weed .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 27]: `` It was most thoughtful of Mr. Hilton Fenley to try and secure us a long night 's uninterrupted sleep , '' said Winter between puffs .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 20]: `` But what a vitiated taste in wine he must attribute to Scotland Yard , '' said Furneaux bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 18]: `` Still , we should be grateful to him for supplying a gill of real evidence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 7]: `` I may forgive him later .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 26]: At present , I want to dilate his eyes with atropine , so that he may see weird shapes and be tortured of ghouls . ''
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 4]: `` Poor devil !
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 9]: He wo n't need atropine for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 8]: `` Do n't believe it , James .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 10]: In some respects he 's cold-blooded as a fish .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 11]: Besides , he carries bromide tablets for his own use .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 12]: He simply could n't have arranged beforehand to dope us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 7]: `` He 's getting scared . ''
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 16]: `` I should think so , indeed -- in the Fenley sense , that is .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 10]: His plot against Robert has miscarried in one essential .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 10]: The rifle has not been found in the wood .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 21]: Now , I 'm in chastened mood , because the hour for action approaches ; so I 'll own up .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 22]: I 've been keeping something up my sleeve , just for the joy of watching you floundering ` midst deep waters .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 9]: Of course , you chose the right channel .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 16]: I knew you would , but it 's a treat to see your elephantine struggles .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 25]: For all that , it 's a sheer impossibility that you should guess who put a sprag in the wheel of Hilton 's chariot .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 11]: Give you three tries , for a new hat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 15]: `` You 're desperately keen today on touching me for a new hat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 11]: `` Well , this time you have an outside chance .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 9]: The others were certs -- for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 8]: Winter smoked in silence for a space .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 10]: `` I 'll take you , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 5]: `` The artist ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 6]: The Jerseyman shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 6]: `` Police Constable Farrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 4]: ventured Winter again .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 13]: Furneaux 's dismay was so comical that his colleague shook with mirth .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 12]: `` I wanted a new silk topper , '' wheezed Winter .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 6]: `` Silk topper be hanged .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 13]: I meant a straw , and that 's what you 'll get .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 13]: But how the deuce did you manage to hit upon Farrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 12]: `` He closed the Quarry Wood at the psychological moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 18]: `` You 're sucking my brains , that 's what you 're doing , '' grumbled Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 7]: `` Anyhow , you 're right .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 18]: Hilton had the scheme perfected to the last detail , but he did n't count on Farrow .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 33]: After a proper display of agitation -- not all assumed , either , because he was more shaken than he expected to be -- he ` phoned the Yard and the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 21]: We could n't arrive for nearly an hour , and the doctor starts on his rounds at nine o'clock sharp .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 30]: What so easy , therefore , as to wander out in a welter of grief and anger , and search the wood for the murderer on his own account ?
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 20]: One solitary minute would enable him to put the rifle in a hiding-place where it would surely be discovered .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 6]: `` But Farrow stopped him .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 12]: I wormed the whole thing out of our sentry this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 32]: Fenley tried hard to send Farrow and Bates off on a wild-goose chase , but Farrow , quite mistakenly , saw the chance of his life and clung on to it .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 10]: Had Farrow budged we could never have hanged Hilton .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 9]: Do n't you see how the scheme works ?
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 21]: He had some reason for believing that Robert will refuse to give a full account of his whereabouts this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 12]: Therefore , he must contrive that the rifle shall be found .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 15]: Put the two damning facts together , and Robert is tied in a knot .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 29]: Of course , he would be forced to prove an alibi , but by that time all England would be yelping , ` Thou art the man . '
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 13]: In any event , Hilton 's trail would be hopelessly lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 16]: `` The true bowket of our port and bromide begins to tickle my nostrils . ''
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 12]: A good-looking maid brought coffee , and Furneaux grinned at her .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 15]: `` How do you think he 'd look in a nice straw hat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 9]: he asked , jerking his head toward Winter .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 4]: The girl smiled .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 10]: The little man 's reputation had reached the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 10]: She glanced demurely at the Superintendent 's bullet head .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 6]: `` Not an ordinary straw .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 9]: You mean a Panama , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 7]: `` Certainly , '' laughed Winter .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 10]: `` Nothing of the sort , '' howled Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 8]: `` Just run your eye over him .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 12]: He is n't an isthmus -- he 's a continent . ''
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 14]: `` A common straw would n't suit him , '' persisted the girl .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 9]: `` He 's too big a gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 8]: `` How little you know him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 3]: said Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 6]: The girl blushed and giggled .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 5]: `` Go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 7]: she said , and bounced out .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 22]: `` This inquiry will cost you a bit , my boy , if you 're not careful , '' sniggered Winter .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 19]: `` I 'll compound on a straw ; but take my advice , and curb your sporting propensities .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 25]: Now , if this coffee is n't doctored , let 's drink it , and interview Robert before the bromide begins to act . ''
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 9]: Robert Fenley received them in his own room .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 33]: He strove to appear at ease and business-like , but , as Furneaux had surmised , was emphatic in his refusal to give any clear statement as to his proceedings in London .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 41]: He admitted the visit to Hendon Road , which , he said , was necessitated by a promise to a friend who was going abroad , but he failed to see why the police should inquire into his private affairs .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 6]: Winter did not press him .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 5]: There was no need .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 13]: A scapegrace 's record could always be laid bare when occasion served .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 9]: But one question he was bound to put .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 25]: `` Have you any theory , however remote or far-fetched , that will account for your father 's death in such a way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 8]: The younger Fenley was smoking a cigarette .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 21]: A half consumed whisky and soda stood on a table ; a bottle of whisky and a siphon promised refreshers .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 11]: He was not quite sober , but could speak lucidly .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 33]: `` Naturally , I 've been thinking a lot about that , '' he said , wrinkling his forehead in the effort to concentrate his mind and express himself with due solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 17]: `` It 's funny , is n't it , that my rifle should be missing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 6]: `` Well , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 15]: Some sarcastic inflection in Winter 's voice seemed to reach a rather torpid brain .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 5]: Fenley looked up sharply .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 15]: `` Of course , funny is n't the right word , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 13]: `` I mean it 's odd , a bit of a mystery .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 18]: Why should anybody take my gun if they wanted to shoot my poor old guv ` nor ?
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 4]: That beats me .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 10]: It 's a licker -- eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 18]: `` It is more important to know why any one should want to shoot your father . ''
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 5]: `` That 's it .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 3]: Who benefits ?
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 16]: Well , I suppose Hilton and I will be better off -- no one else .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 7]: And I did n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 9]: It 's silly even to say so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 13]: `` But there is only your brother left in your summary . ''
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 6]: `` By Jove , yes .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 9]: That 's been runnin ' in my head .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 13]: It 's nonsense , anyhow , because Hilton was in the house .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 26]: I would n't believe a word he said , but Sylvia , and Tomlinson , and Brodie , and Harris all tell the same yarn .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 9]: No ; Hilton could n't have done it .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 25]: He 's ripe for any mischief , is Hilton , but he ca n't be in this hole ; now , can he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 18]: They could extract nothing of value out of Robert , and left him after a brief visit .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 14]: In the interim , Hilton Fenley had kept Tomlinson talking about the crime .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 19]: The dining-room door was ajar , and he knew when the detectives had gone to Robert 's room .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 16]: Then he glanced around the table , and affected to remember the decanter of port .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 26]: `` By the way , '' he said , `` I feel as if a glass of that wine would be a good notion tonight .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 13]: I do n't suppose the Scotland Yard men have finished the lot .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 9]: Just send for it , will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 20]: Harris brought the decanter , and Tomlinson was gratified by seeing that his favorite beverage had been duly appraised .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 18]: `` Sorry if I 've detained you , '' said Fenley , and the butler went out .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 11]: Rising , Fenley strolled to the door and closed it .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 21]: Instantly he became energetic , and his actions bore a curious similitude to those of Winter a little while earlier .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 45]: Pouring the wine into a tumbler , he rinsed the decanter with water , and partly refilled it with the contents of another tumbler previously secreted in the sideboard , stopping rather short of the amount of wine returned from the butler 's room .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 19]: He drank the remainder , washed the glass , and put a few drops of whisky into it .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 43]: Carrying the other tumbler to an open window , he threw the medicated wine into a drain under a water spout , and making assurance doubly sure , douched the same locality with water ; also , he rinsed this second glass .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 11]: He seemed to be rather pleased at his own thoroughness .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 13]: As Furneaux had said , Hilton Fenley was cold-blooded as a fish .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 13]: CHAPTER XIII CLOSE QUARTERS Human affairs are peculiarly dependent on the weather .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 40]: It is not easy to lay down a law governing this postulate , which , indeed , may be scoffed at by the superficial reasoner , and the progression from cause to effect is often obscured by contradictory facts .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 40]: For instance , a fine summer means a good harvest , much traveling , the prolongation of holiday periods , a free circulation of money , and the consequent enhanced prosperity and happiness of millions of men and women .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 15]: But there are more suicides in June and July than in December and January .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 21]: On the one hand , fine weather improves humanity 's lot ; on the other , it depresses the individual .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 47]: Let the logician explain these curiously divergent issues as he may ; there can be no question that the quality of the night which closed a day eventful beyond any other in the annals of Roxton exercised a remarkable influence on the lives of five people .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 8]: It was a perfect night in June .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 46]: There was no moon ; the stars shone dimly through a slight haze ; but the sun had set late and would rise early , and his complete disappearance followed so small a chord of the diurnal circle that his light was never wholly absent .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 42]: A gentle westerly breeze was so zephyr-like that it hardly stirred the leaves of the trees , but it wafted the scent of flowers and meadow land into open windows , and was grateful alike to the just and the unjust .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 74]: Thus to romantic minds it was redolent of romance ; and as Sylvia Manning 's room faced south and John Trenholme 's faced north , and lay nearly opposite each other , though separated by a rolling mile of park , woodland , tillage and pasture , it is not altogether incredible that those two , gazing out at the same hour , should bridge the void with the eyes of the soul .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 13]: It was a night , too , that invited to the open .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 32]: In some favored lands , where the almanac is an infallible Clerk of the Weather , fine nights succeed each other with the monotonous regularity of kings in an Amurath dynasty .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 40]: But the British climate , a slave to no such ordered sequence , scatters or withholds these magic hours almost impartially throughout the seasons , so that June may demand overcoats and umbrellas , and October invite Summer raiment .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 17]: Hence this superb Summer 's night found certain folk in Roxton disinclined to forego its enchantments .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 42]: Trenholme , trying to persuade himself that his brooding gaze rested on the Elizabethan roofs and gables rising above the trees because of some rarely spiritual quality in the atmosphere , suddenly awoke to the fact that the hour was eleven .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 36]: Some men issued from the bar parlor and `` snug '' beneath , and there were sounds of bolts being shot home and keys turned in recognition of the curfew imposed by the licensing laws .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 8]: Then the artistic temperament arose in revolt .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 32]: Chafing already against the narrow confines of the best room the White Horse Inn could provide , it burst all bounds when a tired potman attempted unconsciously to lock it in .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 18]: Grabbing a pipe and tobacco pouch , Trenholme ran downstairs , meeting the potman in the passage .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 12]: `` Get me a key , Bill , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 21]: `` I simply ca n't endure the notion of bed just yet , so I 'm off for a stroll .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 23]: I do n't want to keep any one waiting up , and I suppose I can have a key of sorts . ''
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 22]: Now it happened that the proprietor of the inn was absent at a race meeting , and Eliza was in charge .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 15]: Trenholme 's request was passed on to her , and a key was forthcoming .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 18]: Hatless , pipe in mouth , and hands in pockets , Trenholme sauntered into the village street .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 14]: Romance was either a dull jade or growing old and sedate in Roxton .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 19]: Nearly every house was in darkness , and more than one dog barked because of a passing footstep .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 28]: About half past eleven , Sylvia Manning , sitting in melancholy near her window after an hour of musing , heard a light tap on the door .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 16]: `` Come in , '' she said , recognizing the reason of this late intrusion .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 5]: An elderly woman entered .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 12]: She was an attendant charged with special care of Mrs. Fenley .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 41]: A trained nurse would have refused to adopt the lenient treatment of the patient enjoined by the late head of the family , so this woman was engaged because she was honest , faithful , rather stupid and obeyed orders .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 22]: `` She has quieted down now , miss , and is fast asleep , '' she said in a low tone .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 14]: `` You may feel sure she wo n't wake before six or seven .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 5]: She never does . ''
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 11]: The `` she '' of this message was Mrs. Fenley .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 17]: Rural England does not encourage unnecessary courtesy nor harbor such foreign intruders as `` madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 14]: The reiterated pronoun grated on Sylvia ; she was disinclined for further talk .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 10]: `` Thank you , Parker , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 8]: `` I am glad to know that .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 4]: Good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 14]: But Parker had something to say , and this was a favorable opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 10]: `` She 's been awful bad today , miss .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 7]: It ca n't go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 18]: `` That is hardly surprising , taking into account the shock Mrs. Fenley received this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 12]: `` That 's what I have in me mind , miss .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 5]: She 's changed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 4]: `` How changed ?
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 7]: You need not close the door .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 5]: Never mind the light .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 14]: It is hardly dark when the eyes become used to the gloom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 4]: Parker drew nearer .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 13]: Obeying the instincts of her class , she assumed a confidential tone .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 13]: `` Well , miss , you know why you went out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' said Sylvia rather curtly .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 25]: She had left the invalid when the use of a hypodermic syringe became essential if an imminent outburst of hysteria was to be prevented .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 38]: The girl had no power to interfere , and was too young and inexperienced to make an effective protest ; but she was convinced that to encourage a vice was not the best method of treating it .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 41]: More than once she had spoken of the matter to Mortimer Fenley ; but he merely said that he had tried every known means to cure his wife , short of immuring her in an asylum , and had failed .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 25]: `` She is happy in a sort of a way , '' he would add , with a certain softening of voice and manner .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 7]: `` Let her continue so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 19]: Thus a minor tragedy was drifting to its close when Fenley himself was so rudely robbed of life .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 35]: `` As a rule , miss , '' went on the attendant , `` she soon settles after a dose , but this time she seemed to pass into a sort of a trance .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 47]: Gen ` rally her words are broken-like an ' wild , an ' I pays no heed to 'em ; but tonight she talked wonderful clear , all about India at first , an ' of a band playin ' , with sogers marchin ' past .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 9]: Then she spoke about some people called coolies .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 14]: There was a lot about them , in lines an ' tea gardens .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 14]: An ' she seemed to be speakin ' to another Mrs. Fenley . ''
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 17]: The woman 's voice sank to an awe-stricken whisper , and Sylvia shivered somewhat in sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 6]: `` Another Mrs. Fenley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 53]: It was common knowledge in the household that Fenley had married a second time , but the belief was settled that the first wife was dead ; Parker , by an unrehearsed dramatic touch , conveyed the notion that the unhappy creature in a neighboring room had been conversing with a ghost .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 26]: Somewhat shaken and perturbed , Sylvia wished more than ever to be alone , so she brought her informant back to the matter in hand .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 29]: `` I do n't see that Mrs. Fenley 's rambling utterances give rise to any fear of immediate collapse , '' she said , striving to speak composedly .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 5]: `` No , miss .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 7]: That is n't it at all .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 9]: I was just tellin ' you what happened .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 6]: There was a lot more .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 13]: She might ha ' been givin ' the story of her life .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 17]: But -- please forgive me , miss , for what I 'm goin ' to say .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 27]: I think some one ought to know -- I do , reelly -- an ' you 're the only one I dare tell it to . ''
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 8]: `` Oh , what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 10]: The cry was wrung from the girl 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 16]: She had borne a good deal that day , and feared some sinister revelation now .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 18]: `` She remembered that poor Mr. Fenley was dead , but did n't appear so greatly upset .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 16]: She was more puzzled-like -- kep ' on mutterin ' : ` Who did it ?
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 25]: Who could have the cool darin ' to shoot him dead in broad daylight , at his own door , before his servants ? '
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 35]: She was sort of forcin ' herself to think , to find out , just as if it was a riddle , an ' the right answer was on the tip of her tongue .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 15]: An ' then , all at once , she gev a queer little laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 15]: ` Why , of course , it was Hilton , ' she said . ''
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 10]: Sylvia , relieved and vastly indignant , rose impetuously .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 14]: `` Why do you trouble to bring such nonsense to my ears ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 7]: But Parker was stolid and dogged .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 24]: `` I had to tell some one , '' she vowed , determined to put herself straight with one of her own sex .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 6]: `` I know her ways .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 56]: If that 's in her mind she 'll be shoutin ' it out to every maid who comes near her tomorrow ; an ' I reelly thought , miss , it was wise to tell you tonight , because such a thing would soon cause a scandal , an ' it should be stopped . ''
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 19]: `` Perhaps you are right , and I ought to be obliged to you for being so considerate .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 12]: But no one would pay heed to my aunt 's ravings .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 12]: Every person in the house knows that the statement is absurd .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 7]: Mr. Hilton was in his room .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 32]: I myself saw him go upstairs after exchanging a few words with his father in the hall , and he came down again instantly when Harris ran to fetch him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 28]: `` I understand that , miss , an ' I 'm not so silly as to think there is any sense in her blamin ' Mr. Hilton .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 34]: But it made my flesh creep to hear all the rest so clear an ' straightforward , an ' then that she should say : ` Hilton did it , the black beast .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 25]: He always hated Bob an ' me , because we were white , an ' the jungle strain has come out at last . '
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 15]: Oh , it was somethink dreadful to hear her laughin ' at her cleverness .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 30]: I -- '' `` Please , please , do n't repeat any more of these horrible things , '' cried the girl , for the strain was becoming unbearable .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 8]: `` I agree with you , miss .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 30]: They are n't fit to be spoke of ; an ' I say , with all due respec ' , that they should n't be allowed to leak out .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 9]: You know what young maid servants are like .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 6]: They 're bound to chatter .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 50]: My idee is that another nurse should be engaged tomorrow , a woman old enough to hold her tongue an ' mind her own business ; then the two of us can take turns at duty , so as to keep them housemaids out of the way altogether . ''
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 10]: `` Yes , I 'm sure you are right .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 10]: I 'll speak to Mr. Hilton in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 5]: Thank you , Parker .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 18]: I see now that you meant well , and I 'm sorry if I spoke sharply . ''
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 8]: `` I 'm not surprised , miss .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 22]: It was not a pleasant thing to have to say , nor for you to hear , but duty is duty .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 13]: Good night , miss , I hope you 'll sleep well . ''
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 2]: Sleep !
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 20]: Parker should not have conjured up a new apparition if Sylvia were to seek the solace of untroubled rest .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 15]: At present the girl felt that she had never before been so distressfully awake .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 22]: Splendidly vital in mind and body as she was , she almost yielded now to a morbid horror of her environment .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 26]: Generations of men and women had lived and died in that ancient house , and tonight dim shapes seemed to throng its chambers and corridors .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 13]: Physically fearless , she owned to a feminine dread of the unknown .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 16]: It would be a relief to get away from this abode of grief and mystery .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 21]: The fantastic dreaming of the unhappy creature crooning memories of a past life and a lost husband had unnerved her .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 23]: She resolved to seek the fresh air , and wander through gardens and park until the fever in her mind had abated .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 20]: Now a rule of the house ordained that all doors should be locked and lower windows latched at midnight .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 25]: A night watchman made certain rounds each hour , pressing a key into indicating-clocks at various points to show that he had been alert .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 50]: Mortimer Fenley had been afraid of fire ; there was so much old woodwork in the building that it would burn readily , and a short circuit in the electrical installation was always possible , though every device had been adopted to render it not only improbable but harmless .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 37]: After midnight the door bells and others communicated with a switchboard in the watchman 's room ; and a burglary alarm , which the man adjusted during his first round , rang there continuously if disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 21]: Sylvia , leaving the door of her bedroom ajar , went to the servants ' quarters by a back staircase .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 12]: There she found MacBain , the watchman , eating his supper .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 28]: `` I do n't feel as though I could sleep , '' she explained , `` so I am going out into the park for a while .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 25]: I 'll unlatch one of the drawing-room windows and disconnect the alarm ; and when I come in again I 'll tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 10]: `` Very well , miss , '' said MacBain .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 15]: `` It 's a fine night , and you 'll take no harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 33]: `` I 'm not afraid of rabbits , if that is what you mean , '' she said lightly , for the very sound of the man 's voice had dispelled vapors .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 15]: `` Oh , there 's more than rabbits in the park tonight , miss .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 10]: Two policemen are stationed in the Quarry Wood . ''
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 7]: she said , with some surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 9]: `` They do n't know themselves , miss .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 5]: The Inspector ordered it .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 10]: I met them coming on duty at ten o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 7]: They 'll be relieved at four .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 12]: They have instructions to allow no one to enter the wood .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 7]: That 's all they know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 15]: `` If I go there , then , shall I be locked up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 13]: `` Not so bad as that , miss , '' smiled MacBain .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 13]: `` But I 'd keep away from it if I was you .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 12]: ` Let sleeping dogs lie ' is a good motto . ''
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 8]: `` But these are not sleeping dogs .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 6]: They 're wide-awake policemen . ''
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 5]: `` Mebbe , miss .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 10]: They have a soft job , I 'm thinking .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 19]: Of course -- '' The man checked himself , but Sylvia guessed what was passing in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 19]: `` You were going to say that the wretch who killed my uncle hid in that wood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 4]: she prompted him .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 9]: `` Yes , miss , I was . ''
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 7]: `` He is not there now .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 18]: He must have run away while we were too terrified to take any steps to capture him .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 13]: Who in the world could have wished to kill Mr. Fenley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 10]: `` Ah , miss , there 's no knowing .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 11]: Those you 'd least suspect are often the worst . ''
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 15]: MacBain shook his head over this cryptic remark ; he glanced at a clock .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 7]: It was five minutes to twelve .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 12]: `` It 's rather late , miss , '' he hinted .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 14]: Sylvia agreed with him , but she was young enough to be headstrong .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 14]: `` I sha 'n' t remain out very long , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 24]: `` I ought to feel tired , but I do n't ; and I hope the fresh air will make me sleepy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 12]: To reach the drawing-room , she had to cross the hall .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 9]: Its parquet floor creaked under her rapid tread .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 45]: A single lamp among a cluster in the ceiling burned there all night , and she could not help giving one quick look at the oaken settle which stood under the cross gallery ; she was glad when the drawing-room door closed behind her .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 18]: She had no difficulty with the window , but the outer shutters creaked when she opened them .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 33]: Then she passed on to the first of the Italian terraces , and stood there irresolutely a few minutes , gazing alternately at the sky and the black masses of the trees .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 8]: At first she was a trifle nervous .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 33]: The air was so still , the park so solemn in its utter quietude , that the sense of adventure was absent , and the funeral silence that prevailed was almost oppressive .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 11]: Half inclined to go back , woman-like she went forward .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 16]: Then the sweet , clinging scent of a rose bed drew her like a magnet .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 12]: She descended a flight of steps and gained the second terrace .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 22]: She thought of Trenholme and the picture , and the impulse to stroll as far as the lake seized her irresistibly .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 3]: Why not !
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 13]: The grass was short , and the dew would not be heavy .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 23]: Even if she wetted her feet , what did it matter , as she would undress promptly on returning to her room ?
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 23]: Besides , she had never seen the statue on just such a night , though she had often visited it by moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 23]: La Rochefoucauld is responsible for the oft quoted epigram that the woman who hesitates is lost , and Sylvia had certainly hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 53]: At any rate , after a brief debate in which the arguments were distinctly one-sided , she resolved that she might as well have an object in view as stroll aimlessly in any other direction ; so , gathering her skirts to keep them dry , she set off across the park .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 46]: She might have been halfway to the lake when a man emerged from the same window of the drawing-room , ran to the terrace steps , stumbled down them so awkwardly that he nearly fell , and swore at his own clumsiness in so doing .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 22]: He negotiated the next flight more carefully , but quickened his pace again into a run when he reached the open .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 25]: The girl 's figure was hardly visible , but he knew she was there , and the distance between pursued and pursuer soon lessened .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 57]: Sylvia , wholly unaware of being followed , did not hurry ; but she was constitutionally incapable of loitering , and moved over the rustling grass with a swiftness that brought her to the edge of the lake while the second inmate of The Towers abroad that night was yet a couple of hundred yards distant .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 18]: In the dim light the statue assumed a lifelike semblance that was at once startling and wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 25]: Color flies with the sun , and the white marble did not depend now on tint alone to differentiate it from flesh and blood .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 43]: Seen thus indistinctly , it might almost be a graceful and nearly nude woman standing there , and some display of will power on the girl 's part was called for before she approached nearer and stifled the first breath of apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 46]: Then , delighted by the vague beauty of the scene , with senses soothed by the soft plash of the cascade , she decided to walk around the lake to the spot where Trenholme must have been hidden when he painted that astonishingly vivid picture .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 43]: Its bold treatment and simplicity of note rendered it an easy subject to carry in the mind 's eye , and Sylvia thought it would be rather nice to conjure up the same effect in the prevailing conditions of semi-darkness and mystery .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 16]: She need not risk tearing her dress among the briers which clung to the hillside .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 53]: Knowing every inch of the ground , she could follow the shore of the lake until nearly opposite the statue , and then climb a few feet among the bushes at a point where a zigzag path , seldom used and nearly obliterated by undergrowth , led to the clump of cedars .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 32]: She was still speeding along the farther bank when a man 's form loomed in sight in the park , and her heart throbbed tumultuously with a new and real terror .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 5]: Who could it be ?
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 9]: Had some one seen her leaving the house ?
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 45]: That was the explanation she hoped for at first , but her breath came in sharp gusts and her breast heaved when she remembered how one deadly intruder at least had broken into that quiet haven during the early hours of the past day .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 61]: Whoever the oncomer might prove to be , he was losing no time , and he was yet some twenty yards or more away from the statue -- itself separated from Sylvia by about the same width of water -- when she recognized , with a sigh of relief , the somewhat cumbrous form and grampus-like puffing of Robert Fenley .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 42]: Evidently he was rather blear-eyed , since he seemed to mistake the white marble Aphrodite for a girl in a black dress ; or perhaps he assumed that Sylvia was there , and thought he would see her at any moment .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 7]: `` I say , Sylvia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 27]: `` I say , old girl , what the deuce are you doin ' -- in the park -- at this time o ' night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 16]: The words were clear enough , but there was a suspicious thickness in the voice .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 30]: Robert had been drinking , and Sylvia had learned already to abhor and shun a man under the influence of intoxicants more than anything else in the wide world .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 9]: She did not fear her `` cousin . ''
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 43]: For years she had tolerated him , and that day she had come to dislike him actively , but she had not the least intention of entering into an explanation of her actions with him at that hour and under existing circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 30]: She had recovered from her sudden fright , and was merely annoyed now , and bent her wits to the combined problems of escape and regaining the house unseen .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 27]: Remembering that her white face and hands might reveal her whereabouts she turned , bent and crept up the slope until a bush afforded welcome concealment .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 16]: Some thorns scratched her ankles , but she gave no heed to such trivial mishaps .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 54]: A rabbit jumped out from under her feet , and it cost something of an effort to repress a slight scream ; but -- to her credit be it said -- she set her lips tightly , and was almost amused by the game of hide and seek thus unexpectedly thrust on her .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 21]: Meanwhile Robert had reached the little promontory on which the statue was poised , and no Sylvia was in sight .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 4]: `` Sylvia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 4]: he cried again .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 5]: `` Where are you ?
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 12]: No use hidin ' , because I know you 're here !
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 20]: Dash it all , if you wanted a bit of a stroll why did n't you send for me ?
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 14]: You knew I 'd come like a shot -- eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 25]: He listened and peered , but might as well have been deaf and blind for aught he could distinguish of the girl he sought .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 30]: Then he laughed ; and a peculiar quality in that chuckle of mirth struck a new note of anxiety , even of fear , in Sylvia 's laboring heart .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 9]: `` So you wo n't be good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 4]: he guffawed thickly .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 11]: `` Playin ' Puss in the Corner , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 10]: Very well , I give you fair warnin ' .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 23]: I mean to catch you , an ' when I do I 'll claim forfeit ... _ I _ do n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 7]: Fact is , I like it .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 31]: It 's rather fun chasin ' one 's best girl in the dark ... Dashed if it is n't better 'n a bit out of a French farce ... Puss !
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 2]: Puss !
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 15]: ... I see you ... Hidin ' there among the bushy bushes ... Gad !
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 11]: How 's that for a test after a big night ?
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 3]: Bushy bushes !
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 6]: I must not forget that .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 15]: Try it on one of the b-boys ... Now , come out of it !
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 4]: ... Naughty puss !
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 15]: I 'll get you in a tick , see if I do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 25]: He was keeping to the track Sylvia herself had taken , since the lie of the land was familiar to him as to her .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 47]: Talking to himself , cackling at his own flashes of wit , halting after each few paces to search the immediate neighborhood and detect any guiding sound , he was now on the same side of the lake as the girl , and coming perilously near .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 14]: At each step , apparently , he found the growing obscurity more tantalizing .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 9]: He still continued calling aloud : `` Sylvia !
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 5]: Sylvia , I say !
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 7]: Chuck it , ca n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 8]: You must give in , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 11]: I 'll be grabbin ' you in a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 16]: There were not lacking muttered ejaculations , which showed that he was losing his temper .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 43]: Once he swore so emphatically that she thought he was acknowledging himself beaten ; but some glimmering notion that she was crouching almost within reach , and would have the laugh of him in the morning , flogged him to fresh endeavor .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 11]: Now he was within ten yards , eight , five !
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 17]: In another few seconds his hand might touch her , and she quivered at the thought .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 22]: If concealment could not save her she must seek refuge in flight , since therein lay a sure means of escape .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 26]: Not daring to delay , she tried to stand upright , but felt a pull on her dress as if a hand were detaining her .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 42]: It was only a brier , insidiously entangled in a fold of her skirt ; but she was rather excited now , and there was little to be gained by excess of caution , for any rapid movement must betray her .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 16]: Stooping , she caught the thorn-laden branch and tore it out of the soft material .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 7]: Fenley heard the ripping sound instantly .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 7]: There you are , my beauty !
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 6]: Got you this time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 7]: he cried , and plunged forward .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 16]: Sylvia sprang from her hiding-place like a frightened fawn and valiantly essayed the steep embankment .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 4]: Therein she erred .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 32]: She would have succeeded in evading her pursuer had she leaped down to the open strip of turf close to the water , dodging him before he realized what was happening .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 35]: As it was , the briers spread a hundred cruel claws against her ; with each upward step she encountered greater resistance ; desperation only added to her panic , and she struggled frenziedly .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 22]: The man , unhampered by garments such as clogged each inch of Sylvia 's path , pushed on with renewed ardor .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 32]: He no longer spoke , for his hearing alone could help him now , the girl 's black-robed form being utterly merged in the dense shadow cast by brushwood and cedars .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 29]: He , however , was silhouetted against the luminous gray of the park , and Sylvia , casting a frantic glance over her shoulder , saw him distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 46]: In her distress she fancied she could feel his hot breath on her neck ; and when some unusually venomous branch clutched her across the knees , and rendered farther movement impossible until her dress was extricated , she wailed aloud in anger and dismay .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 6]: `` How dare you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 11]: she cried , and her voice was tremulous and broken .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 17]: `` I warn you that if you persist in following me I shall strike you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 8]: `` Will you , by Jove ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 4]: cried Robert elatedly .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 11]: `` I 'd risk more than that , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 6]: A kiss for every blow !
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 6]: Only fair , you know !
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 5]: Eh , what ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 4]: On he came .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 24]: He was so near that in one active bound he would be upon her , but he advanced warily , with hands outstretched .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 9]: `` Oh , what shall I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 3]: she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 7]: `` Go back , you brute !
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 6]: I -- I hate you .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 7]: There are policemen in the wood .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 7]: I 'll scream for help ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 21]: `` No need , Miss Manning , '' said a calm voice which seemed to come from the circumambient air .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 15]: `` Do n't cry out or be alarmed , no matter what happens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 15]: A hand , not Robert Fenley 's caught her shoulder in a reassuring grip .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 42]: A tall figure brushed by , and she heard a curious sound that had a certain smack in it -- a hard smack , combined with a thudding effect , as if some one had smitten a pillow with a fist .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 17]: A fist it was assuredly , and a hard one ; but it smote no pillow .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 37]: With a gurgling cough , Robert Fenley toppled headlong to the edge of the lake , and lay there probably some minutes , for the man who had hit him knew how and where to strike .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 5]: Sylvia did not scream .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 14]: She had recognized Trenholme 's voice , but she felt absurdly like fainting .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 50]: Perhaps she swayed slightly , and her rescuer was aware of it , for he gathered her up in his arms as he might carry a scared child , nor did he set her on her feet when they were clear of the trees and in the open park .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 12]: `` You are quite safe now , '' he said soothingly .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 32]: `` You are greatly upset , of course , and you need a minute or two to pull yourself together ; but no one will hurt you while I am here .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 24]: When you feel able to speak , you 'll tell me where to take you , and I 'll be your escort . ''
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 21]: `` I can speak now , thank you , '' said Sylvia , with a composure that was somewhat remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 7]: `` Please put me down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 17]: He obeyed , but she imagined he gave her a silent hug before his clasp relaxed .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 15]: Even then his left hand still rested on her shoulder in a protective way .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 61]: CHAPTER XIV THE SPREADING OF THE NET That John Trenholme should be in the right place at the right moment , and that the place should happen to be one where his presence was urgently required in Sylvia Manning 's behalf , was not such a far-fetched coincidence as it might be deemed , for instance , by a jury .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 36]: Juries are composed mainly of bald-headed men , men whose shining pates have been denuded of hair by years and experience , and these factors dry the heart as surely as they impoverish the scalp .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 45]: Consequently , juries -LRB- in bulk , be it understood ; individual jurors may , perhaps , retain the emotional equipment of a Chatterton -RRB- are skeptical when asked to accept the vagaries of the artistic temperament in extenuation of some so-called irrational action .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 32]: In the present case counsel for the defense would plead that his clients -LRB- Sylvia would undoubtedly figure in the charge -RRB- were moved by an overwhelming impulse shared in common .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 64]: It was a glorious night , he might urge ; each had been thinking of the other ; each elected to stroll forth under the stars ; their sympathies were linked by the strange circumstances which had led to the production of a noteworthy picture -- what more likely than that they should visit the scene to which that picture owed its genesis ?
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 63]: Trenholme , it might be held , had not knowingly reached that stage of soul-sickness which brings the passionate cry to _ Valentine 's _ lips : Except I be by Sylvia in the night , There is no music in the nightingale ; Unless I look on Sylvia in the day , There is no day for me to look upon .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 56]: `` But , gentlemen , '' the wily one would continue , `` that indefinable excitation of the nervous system which is summed up in the one small word ` love ' must have a beginning ; and whether that beginning springs from spore or germ , it is admittedly capable of amazingly rapid growth .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 79]: The male defendant may not even have been aware of its existence , but subsequent events establish the diagnosis beyond cavil ; and I would remind you that the melodious lines I have just quoted could not have been written by our immortal bard , Shakespeare , if two gentlemen of Verona , and two Veronese ladies as well , had not yielded to influences not altogether unlike those which governed my clients on this memorable occasion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 10]: Juries invariably treat Shakespeare 's opinions with profound respect .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 34]: They know they ought to be well acquainted with his `` works , '' but they are not , and hope to conceal their ignorance by accepting the poet 's philosophy without reservation .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 30]: If , however , owing to the forensic skill of an advocate , romance might be held accountable for the wanderings of John and Sylvia , what of Robert ?
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 12]: He , at least , was not under its magic spell .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 14]: He , when the fateful hour struck , was merely drinking himself drowsy .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 27]: To explain _ him _ , witnesses would be needed , and who more credible than a Superintendent and Detective Inspector of the Criminal Investigation Department ?
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 42]: When Winter had smoked , and Furneaux had contributed some personal reminiscences the whole aim and object of which was the perplexing and mystification of that discreet person , Tomlinson , the two retired to their room at an early hour .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 22]: The butler pressed them hospitably to try the house 's special blend of Scotch whisky , but they had declined resolutely .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 19]: Both acknowledged to an unwonted lassitude and sleepiness -- symptoms which Hilton Fenley might expect and inquire about .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 17]: When they were gone , the major domo sat down to review the day 's doings .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 22]: His master 's death at the hands of a murderer had shocked and saddened him far more than his manner betrayed .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 22]: If some fantastic chain of events brought Tomlinson to the scaffold he would still retain the demeanor of an exemplary butler .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 61]: But beneath the externals of his office he had a heart and a brain ; and his heart grieved for a respected employer , and his brain told him that Scotland Yard was no wiser than he when it came to suspecting a likely person of having committed the crime , let alone arresting the suspect and proving his guilt .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 9]: Of course , therein Tomlinson was in error .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 33]: Even butlers of renown have their limitations , and his stopped far short of the peculiar science of felon-hunting in which Winter and Furneaux were geniuses , each in his own line .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 21]: Assuredly he would have been vastly astonished could he have seen their movements when the bedroom door closed on them .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 24]: In fact , his trained ear might have found some new quality in such a commonplace thing as the closing of the door .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 38]: Every lock and bolt and catch in The Towers was in perfect working order , yet the lock of this door failed to click , for the excellent reason that it was jammed by a tiny wedge .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 25]: Hence , it could be opened noiselessly if need be ; and lest a hinge might squeak each hinge was forthwith drenched with vaseline .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 22]: Further , a tiny circlet of India rubber , equipped with a small spike , was placed between door and jamb .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 15]: Then , murmuring in undertones when they spoke , the detectives unpacked their portmanteaux .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 24]: Winter produced no article out of the ordinary run , but Furneaux unrolled a knotted contrivance which proved to be a rope ladder .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 19]: `` One or both of us may have to go out by the window , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 26]: `` At any rate , we have Wellington 's authority for the military axiom that a good leader always provides a line of retreat . ''
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 13]: `` I wonder what became of the rest of that wine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 15]: said Winter , rolling the beer bottle in a shirt and stowing it away .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 7]: `` I did n't dare ask .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 10]: Tomlinson can put two and two together rather cleverly .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 23]: He _ almost _ interfered when Harris brought the decanter , so I dropped the wine question like a hot potato . ''
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 16]: `` It had gone , though , when we came back from Robert 's room .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 5]: Hilton sent for it .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 56]: Bet you another new hat he emptied -- '' `` You 'll get no more new hats out of me , '' growled Furneaux savagely , giving an extra pressure to a pair of sharp hooks which gripped the window sill , and from which the rope ladder could be dropped to the ground instantly .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 3]: `` Sorry .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 9]: Where did you retrieve that dirty towel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 24]: For the little man had taken from a pocket an object which merited the description , and was placing it in his bag .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 8]: `` It 's one of Hilton 's .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 11]: He used it to wipe bark moss off his clothes .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 11]: Queer thing that such rascals always omit some trivial precaution .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 15]: He should have burned the towel with the moccasins ; but he do n't .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 9]: This towel will help to strangle him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 13]: `` You 're becoming a bloodthirsty detective , '' mused Winter aloud .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 9]: `` I 've seldom seen you so vindictive .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 5]: Why is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 13]: `` I dislike snakes , and this fellow is a poisonous specimen .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 17]: If there were no snakes in the world , we should all be so happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 8]: `` Blessed if I see that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 13]: `` I have always suspected that your religious education had been neglected .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 6]: Read the Bible and Milton .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 14]: Then you 'll understand ; and incidentally speak and write better English . ''
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 18]: `` Can you suggest any means whereby I can grasp your jokes without being bored to weariness ?
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 7]: They 're more soporific than bromide .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 9]: Anyhow , it 's time we undressed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 39]: Though the blind was drawn the window was open ; there was no knowing who might be watching from the garden , so they went through all the motions of undressing and placed their boots outside the door .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 21]: Then the light was switched off , the blind raised , and they dressed again rapidly , donning other boots .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 26]: Each pocketed an automatic pistol and an electric torch and , by preconcerted plan , Winter sat by the window and Furneaux by the door .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 27]: It was then a quarter to eleven , and they hardly looked for any developments until a much later hour , but they neglected no precaution .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 27]: Unquestionably it would be difficult for any one to move about in that part of the house , or cross the gardens without attracting their attention .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 23]: Their room was situated on the south front , two doors from Sylvia 's , and two from Hilton Fenley 's bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 16]: The door lay in shadow beyond the range of the light burning in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 9]: Sylvia 's room was farther along the corridor .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 23]: The door of Hilton 's bedroom occupied the same plane ; the door of his sitting-room faced the end of the corridor .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 30]: The walls were massive , as in all Tudor houses , and the doors so deeply recessed that there was space for a small mat in front of each .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 24]: Ordinarily boots placed there were not visible in the line of the corridor , but the detectives ' footgear stood well in view .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 7]: There were two reasons for this .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 70]: In the first place , Hilton Fenley might like to see them , so his highly probable if modest desire was gratified ; secondly , when Parker visited Sylvia and quitted her , and when Sylvia went downstairs , Furneaux 's head , lying between two pairs of boots , could scarcely be distinguished , while his scope of vision was only slightly , if at all , diminished .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 28]: Soon the girl 's footsteps could be heard crossing the hall , and the raising of the drawing-room window and opening of the shutters were clearly audible .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 16]: Winter , whose office had been a sinecure hitherto , now came into the scheme .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 26]: He saw Sylvia 's slight form standing beneath , marked her hesitancy , and watched her slow progress down the terraces and into the park .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 46]: This nocturnal enterprise on her part was rather perplexing , and he was in two minds whether or not to cross the room and consult with Furneaux , when the latter suddenly withdrew his head , closed the door , and hissed `` Snore ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 24]: Winter crept to a bed , and put up an artistic performance , a duet , musical , regular , not too loud .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 11]: In a little while his colleague 's `` S-s-t ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 24]: stopped him , and a slight crack of a finger against a thumb called him to the door , which was open again .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 4]: Explanation was needless .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 25]: Hilton Fenley , like the other watchers , hearing the creaking of window and shutters , had looked out from his own darkened room .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 56]: In all likelihood , thanking his stars for the happy chance given thus unexpectedly , he noted the direction the girl was taking , and acted as if prepared for this very development ; the truth being , of course , that he was merely adapting his own plans to immediate and more favorable conditions .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 11]: Coming out into the corridor , he consulted his watch .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 32]: Then he glanced in the direction of the room which held the two men he had cause to fear -- such ample cause as he little dreamed of at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 46]: To make assurance doubly sure , he walked that way , not secretly , but boldly , since it was part of his project now to court observation -- by others , at any rate , if not by the drugged emissaries of Scotland Yard .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 22]: He waited outside the closed door and heard what he expected to hear , the snoring of two men sound asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 21]: Returning , he did not re√´nter his own room , but crossed the head of the staircase to Robert 's .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 13]: He knocked lightly , and his brother 's `` Hello , there !
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 4]: Come in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 5]: reached Furneaux 's ears .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 19]: Not a word of the remainder of the colloquy that ensued was lost on either of the detectives .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 54]: `` Sorry to disturb you , Bob , '' said Hilton , speaking from the doorway , `` but I thought you might not be in bed , and I 've come to tell you that Sylvia has just gone out by way of the drawing-room and is wandering about the park . ''
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 3]: `` Sylvia !
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 5]: On her lonesome ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 6]: was Robert 's astounded cry .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 5]: It is n't right .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 7]: I ca n't understand her behavior .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 33]: I would have followed her myself ; but in view of your statement at dinner tonight , I fancied it would save some annoyance if I entrusted that duty to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 16]: `` Look here , Hilton , old chap , are you really in earnest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 4]: `` About Sylvia ?
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 5]: I actually saw her .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 10]: At this moment she is heading for the lake .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 10]: If you hurry you 'll see her yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 45]: `` I say , it 's awfully decent of you ... I take back a lot of what I said tonight ... Of course , as matters stand , this is _ my _ job ... Tell MacBain not to lock us out . ''
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 10]: `` I 'll attend to that , if necessary .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 8]: But do n't mention me to Sylvia .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 10]: She might resent the notion of being spied on .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 10]: Say that you , too , were strolling about .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 16]: You see , I heard the window being opened , and looked out , naturally .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 14]: Anyhow , drop me , and run this affair on your own . ''
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 23]: Robert was slightly obfuscated -- the fresh air quickly made him worse -- but he was sensible of having grossly misjudged Hilton .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 10]: `` Right-O , '' he said , hurrying downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 11]: `` We 'll have a talk in the mornin ' .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 3]: Dash it !
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 5]: It 's twelve o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 4]: That silly kid !
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 12]: What 's she after , I 'd like to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 14]: Robert gone , Hilton returned to his own room and rang a bell .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 18]: MacBain came , and was asked if he was aware that Miss Sylvia had quitted the house .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 27]: MacBain gave his version of the story , and Fenley remarked that he might leave the window unfastened until he made his rounds at one o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 23]: Seemingly as an afterthought , Hilton mentioned his brother 's open door , and MacBain discovered that Mr. Robert was missing also .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 25]: By that time the detectives , without exchanging a word , had each arrived at the same opinion as to the trend of events .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 12]: Hilton Fenley was remodeling his projects to suit an unforeseen development .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 23]: No matter what motive inspired Sylvia Manning 's midnight ramble , there could be no disputing the influence which dominated Robert Fenley .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 7]: He was his brother 's catspaw .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 60]: When his rifle was found next day MacBain 's testimony would be a tremendous addition to the weight of evidence against him , since any unprejudiced judgment must decide that the pursuit of his `` cousin '' was a mere pretense to enable him to go out and search for the weapon he had foolishly left in the wood .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 16]: Hilton might or might not admit that he told Robert of the girl 's escapade .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 24]: If he did admit it , he might be trusted to give the incident the requisite kink to turn the scale against Robert .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 55]: Surveying the facts with cold impartiality afterwards , Scotland Yard decided that while Hilton could not hope that Robert would be convicted of the murder , the latter would assuredly be suspected of it , perhaps arrested and tried ; and in any event his marriage with Sylvia Manning would become a sheer impossibility .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 29]: Moreover , once the rifle was found by the police , the only reasonable prospect of connecting Hilton himself with the crime would have vanished into thin air .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 31]: If that weapon were picked up in the Quarry Wood , or for that matter in any other part of the estate , the hounds of the law were beaten .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 36]: Winter 's level-headed shrewdness and Furneaux 's almost uncanny intuition might have saddled Hilton with blood guiltiness , but a wide chasm must be bridged before they could provide the requisite proof of their theory .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 17]: In fact , thus far they dared not even hint at bringing a charge against him .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 38]: To succeed , they had to show that the incredible was credible , that a murderer could be in a room within a few feet of his victim and in a wood distant fully four hundred yards .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 26]: It was a baffling problem , not wholly incapable of solution by circumstantial evidence , but best left to be elucidated by Hilton Fenley himself .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 36]: They believed now that he was about to oblige them by supplying that corroborative detail which , in the words of Poohbah , `` lends artistic verisimilitude to an otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative . ''
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 19]: Winter drew Furneaux into the room , and breathed the words into his ear : `` You go .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 8]: You stand less chance of being seen .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 7]: I 'll search his room . ''
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 15]: `` If there is a misfire , show a signal after five minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 4]: `` Right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 41]: Furneaux , standing back from the window , but in such a position that a light would be visible to any one perched on the rock in the wood , pressed the button of an electric torch three times rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 16]: Then he lowered the rope ladder and clambered down with the nimbleness of a sailor .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 34]: In all probability , Hilton Fenley was still talking to MacBain and creating the illusion that the last thing he would think of was a stroll out of doors at that late hour .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 8]: But the little man took no chances .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 23]: Having surveyed the ground carefully during the day , he was not bothered now by doubts as to the most practicable path .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 41]: Creeping close to the house till he reached the yew hedge , and then passing through an arch , he remained in the shadow of the hedge till it turned at a right angle in front of the Italian garden .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 30]: From that point to the edge of the Quarry Wood was not a stone 's throw , and clumps of rhododendrons and other flowering shrubs gave shelter in plenty .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 26]: Arrived at the mouth of the footpath , which he had marked by counting the trees in the avenue , he halted and listened intently .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 11]: There was no sound of rustling grass or crunched gravel .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 6]: Hilton was taking matters leisurely .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 15]: Fifteen minutes would give him ample time for the business he had in hand .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 43]: Even if Robert and Sylvia reached home before him , which was unlikely -- far more unlikely even than he imagined -- he could say that he thought it advisable to follow his brother and help in the search for the girl .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 18]: The same excuse would serve if he met any of those pestilential police prowling about the grounds .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 22]: Indeed , he could dispatch the alert and intelligent ones on the trail of the wanderers , especially on Robert 's .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 23]: In a word , matters were going well for Hilton , so well that Furneaux laughed as he turned into the wood .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 9]: Here the detective had to advance with care .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 25]: Beneath the trees the darkness was now so complete that it had that peculiar quality of density which everyday speech likens to a wall .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 43]: Cats , gamekeepers , poachers , and other creatures of predatory and nocturnal habits can find and follow a definite track under such conditions ; but detectives are nearly human , and Furneaux was compelled to use the torch more than once .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 8]: He ran no risk in doing this .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 19]: Hilton Fenley could not yet be in a position to catch the gleam of light among the trees .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 25]: The one thing to avoid was delay , and Furneaux had gained rather than lost time , unless Fenley was running at top speed .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 31]: After crossing the damp hollow the Jerseyman had no further difficulty ; he breasted the hill and kept a hand extended so as to avoid colliding with a tree trunk .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 32]: Expecting at any instant to have a bull 's - eye lantern flashed in his eyes , which he did not want to happen , he said softly : `` Hi !
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 3]: You two !
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 6]: Do n't show a light !
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 6]: How near are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 10]: `` Oh , it 's you , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 4]: said a voice .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 7]: `` We thought it would be .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 17]: We saw the signal , and you said you might be the first to arrive . ''
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 6]: `` Any second signal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 6]: `` No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 15]: Furneaux recognized the pungent scent of the colza oil used in policemen 's lamps .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 30]: `` By gad , '' he said , `` if the average criminal had the nose of the veriest cur dog he 'd smell that oil a mile away .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 6]: Now , where are you ?
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 3]: There . ''
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 10]: He had butted into a constable 's solid bulk .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 9]: `` Take me to the rock -- quick .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 16]: We must hide behind it , on the lower side ... Is this the place ?
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 2]: Right !
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 30]: Squat down , both of you , and make yourselves comfortable , so that you wo n't feel your position irksome , and move perhaps at the wrong moment .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 19]: When you feel me crawling away , follow to the upper foot of the rock -- no farther .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 14]: `` Stand upright then , and try to keep your joints from cracking .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 10]: There must be no creaking of belts or boots .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 6]: Absolute silence is the order .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 5]: Not a word spoken .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 20]: No matter what you hear , do n't move again until you see the light of my electric torch .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 22]: Then run to me , turning on your own lamps , and help in arresting any one I may be holding .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 19]: Use your handcuffs if necessary , and do n't hesitate to grab hard if there is a struggle .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 18]: Remember , you are to arrest _ any one _ , no matter who it may be .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 4]: Got that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 11]: `` Yes , sir , '' came two eager voices .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 6]: `` Do n't be excited .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 7]: It will be an easy thing .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 11]: If we make a mistake , I bear the responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 13]: Now , keep still as mice when they hear a cat . ''
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 6]: One of the men giggled .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 32]: Both constables had met Furneaux in the local police station that afternoon , as he had asked the Inspector to parade the pair who would be on duty during the night .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 28]: It was then that he had arranged a simple code of flash signals , and warned them to look out for Winter or himself during the night .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 42]: Any other person who turned up was not to be challenged until he reached the higher ground beyond the rock , but that instruction was to be acted on only in the unavoidable absence of one of the Scotland Yard officers .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 11]: Privately , the constables hoped Furneaux would be their leader .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 19]: They deemed him `` a funny little josser , '' and marveled greatly at his manner and appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 30]: Still , they had heard of his reputation ; the Inspector , in an expansive moment , had observed that `` Monkey Face was sharper than he looked . ''
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 13]: Thinking example better than precept , Furneaux did not reprove the giggler .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 47]: Lying there , screened even in broad daylight by the bulk of the rock and some hazels growing vigorously in that restricted area owing to the absence of foliage overhead , he listened to the voices of the night , never dumb in a large wood .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 58]: Birds fluttered uneasily on the upper branches of the trees -- indeed , Furneaux was lucky in that the occasional gleam of the torch had not sent a pheasant hurtling off with frantic clamor ere ever the rendezvous was reached -- and some winged creature , probably an owl , swept over the rock in stealthy flight .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 36]: The rabbits were all out in the open , nibbling grass and crops at leisure , but there were other tiny forms rustling among the shrubs and scampering across the soft carpet of fallen leaves .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 87]: Twitterings , and subdued squeaks , and sudden rushes of pattering feet , the murmuring of myriad fronds in the placid breeze , the whispering of the neighboring elms , even the steady chant of the distant cascade -- all swelled into a soft and continuous chorus , hardly heard by the country policemen , accustomed as they were to the sounds of a woodland at night , but of surprising volume and variety to the man whose forests lay in the paved wilderness of London .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 11]: Suddenly a twig cracked sharply and a match was struck .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 28]: It was of the safety type and made little noise , but it was too much for the nerves of a bird , which flew away noisily .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 9]: Furneaux pursed his lips and wanted to whistle .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 10]: He realized now what an escape he had earlier .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 15]: But the intruder seemed to care less about attracting attention than making rapid progress .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 22]: He came on swiftly , striking other matches when required , until he stood on the bare ground near the rock .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 29]: Not daring to lift a head , none of the three watchers could see the newcomer , and in that respect their hiding-place was almost too well chosen .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 14]: Whoever it was , he needed no more matches to guide his footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 13]: They heard him advancing a few paces ; then he halted again .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 27]: After a marked interval , punctuated by a soft , whirring noise hard to interpret , there were irregular scrapings and the creaking of a branch .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 3]: Furneaux arose .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 21]: Keeping a hand on the rock until he was clear of the shrubs , he crept forward on thievish feet .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 42]: His assistants , moving more clumsily to their allotted station , were audible enough to him , but to a man unconscious of their presence , and actively climbing a tree , they were remote and still as Uranus and Saturn .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 49]: The scraping of feet and heavy breathing , to say nothing of the prompt flight of several birds , led the detective unerringly to the trunk of a lofty chestnut which he had already fixed on as the cover whence the shot that killed Mortimer Fenley was fired .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 30]: He was convinced also that the rifle was yet hidden there , and his thin lips parted in a smile now that his theory was about to be justified .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 12]: He could follow the panting efforts of the climber quite easily .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 23]: He knew when the weapon was unlashed from the limb to which it was bound , and when the descent was begun .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 37]: He could measure almost the exact distance of his prey from the ground , and was awaiting the final drop before flashing the torch on his prisoner , when something rapped him smartly on the forehead .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 45]: It was a rope , doubled and twisted , and subsequent investigation showed that it must have been thrown in a coil over the lowermost branch in order to facilitate the only difficult part of the climb offered by ten feet of straight bole .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 10]: That trivial incident changed the whole course of events .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 54]: Taken by surprise , since he did not know what had struck him , Furneaux pressed the governor of the torch a second too soon , and his eyes , raised instantaneously , met those of Hilton Fenley , who was on the point of letting go the branch and swinging himself down .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 25]: During a thrilling moment they gazed at each other , the detective cool and seemingly unconcerned , the self-avowed murderer livid with mortal fear .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 9]: Then Furneaux caught the rope and held it .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 15]: `` I thought you 'd go climbing tonight , Fenley , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 6]: `` Let me assist you .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 5]: Tricky things , ropes .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 11]: You 're at the wrong end of this one . ''
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 15]: Even Homer nods , but Furneaux had erred three times in as many seconds .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 26]: He had switched on the light prematurely , and his ready banter had warned the parricide that a well-built scheme was crumbling to irretrievable ruin .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 16]: Moreover , he had underrated the nervous forces of the man thus trapped and outwitted .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 19]: Fenley knew that when his feet touched the earth he would begin a ghastly pilgrimage to the scaffold .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 25]: Two yellow orbs of light were already springing up the slight incline from the rock , betokening the presence of captors in overwhelming number .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 6]: What was to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 29]: Nothing , in reason , yet Furneaux had likened him to a snake , and he displayed now the primal instinct of the snake to fight when cornered .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 18]: Thrusting the heavy gun he was carrying straight downward , he delivered a vicious and unerring blow .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 37]: The stock caught the detective on the crown of the head , and he fell to his knees , dropping the torch , which of course went out as soon as the thumb relaxed its pressure .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 32]: CHAPTER XV SOME STAGE EFFECTS Fenley himself dropped almost simultaneously with the rifle , landing with both feet on Furneaux 's back , and thus completing the little man 's discomfiture .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 34]: By that time the two policemen were nearly upon him , but he was lithe and fierce as a cobra , and had seized the rifle again before they could close with him .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 19]: Jabbing the nearer adversary with the muzzle , he smashed a lamp and sent its owner sprawling backward .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 16]: Then , swinging the weapon , he aimed a murderous blow at the second constable .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 35]: The man contrived to avoid it to a certain extent , but it glanced off his left arm and caught the side of his head ; and he , too , measured his length .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 50]: All three , detective and police , were on their feet promptly , for none was seriously injured ; but Furneaux was dazed and had to grope for the torch , and the second constable 's lamp had gone out owing to a rush of oil from the cistern .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 13]: Thus , during some precious seconds , they were in total darkness .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 5]: Meanwhile Fenley had escaped .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 17]: Luck , after deserting him , had come to his rescue in the nick of time .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 61]: He had blundered into the path , and managed to keep to it , and the somewhat strong language in which Furneaux expressed his feelings anent the Hertfordshire Constabulary , and the no less lurid comments of two angry members of the force , helped to conceal the sounds which would otherwise have indicated the direction taken by the fugitive .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 14]: At last , having found the torch , Furneaux collected his scattered wits .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 23]: `` Now do n't be scared and run away , you two , '' he said sarcastically , producing an automatic pistol .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 17]: `` I 'm only going to tell Mr. Winter that we 've bungled the job . ''
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 39]: He fired twice in the air , and two vivid spurts of flame rose high among the branches of the chestnut ; but the loud reports of the shooting were as nothing compared with the din that followed .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 13]: Every rook within a mile flew from its eyrie and cawed strenuously .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 34]: Pheasants clucked and clattered in all directions , owls hooted , and dogs barked in the kennels , in the stable yard , and in nearly every house of the two neighboring villages .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 44]: `` I do n't see what good that 'll do , sir , '' was the rueful comment of the policeman who had , in his own phrase , `` collected a thick ear , '' and was now feeling the spot tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 17]: `` He has n't shinned up the tree again ; that 's a positive certainty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 26]: `` I should have thought that a really clever fellow like you would guess that I wanted to raise a row , '' said Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 12]: `` Have you breath enough left to blow your whistles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 19]: `` But , sir , your orders were -- '' `` Blow , and be damned to you .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 9]: Do n't I know the fault is mine !
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 7]: Blow , and crack your cheeks !
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 14]: Blow wild peals , my Roberts , else we are copped coppers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 22]: The mild radiance of the torch showed that the detective 's face was white with fury and his eyes gleaming red .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 32]: To think that a dangling rope 's end should have spoiled his finest capture , undone a flawless piece of imaginative reasoning which his own full record had never before equaled !
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 6]: It was humiliating , maddening .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 8]: No wonder the policemen thought him crazy !
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 7]: But they whistled with a will .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 11]: Winter heard them , and was stirred to strange activities .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 24]: Robert Fenley , recovering from an ague and sickness , heard and marveled at the pandemonium which had broken loose in the park .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 23]: The household at The Towers was aroused , heads were craned out of windows , women screamed , and men dressed hastily .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 21]: Keepers , estate hands , and stablemen tumbled into their garments and hurried out , armed with guns and cudgels .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 31]: An unhappy woman , tossing in the fitful dreams of drug-induced sleep , was awakened by the pistol shots and terrified by the noise of slamming doors and hurrying feet .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 15]: She struggled out of bed and screamed for an attendant , but none came .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 45]: She pressed an electric bell , which rang continuously in the night watchman 's room ; but he had run to the front of the house and was unlocking the front door , where a squad of willing men soon awaited Winter 's instructions .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 28]: For the Superintendent , after rushing to the telephone , had shouted an order to MacBain before he made off in the direction of the Quarry Wood .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 31]: The one tocsin which exercises a dread significance in a peaceful and law-abiding English community at the present day struck a new and awful note in Hilton Fenley 's brain .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 10]: Fool that he was , why had he fought ?
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 5]: Why was he flying ?
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 15]: Had he brazened it out , the police would not have dared arrest him .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 11]: His brain was as acute as the best of theirs .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 31]: He could have evolved a theory of the crime as subtle as any detective 's , and who so keen-witted as a son eager to avenge a father 's murder ?
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 16]: But he had thrown away a gambler 's chance by a moment of frenzied struggle .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 5]: He was doomed now .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 8]: No plausible explanation would serve his need .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 4]: He was hunted .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 6]: The pack was after him .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 14]: The fox had broken cover , and the hounds were in full cry .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 5]: Whither should he go ?
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 4]: He knew not .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 26]: Still clutching the empty gun -- for which he had not even one cartridge in his pockets -- he made hopelessly for the open park .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 33]: Already some glimmer of light showed that he was winning free of these accursed trees , which had stretched forth a thousand hands to tear his flesh and trip his uncertain feet .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 10]: That way , at least , lay the world .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 11]: In the wood he might have circled blindly until captured .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 34]: Now a drawback of such roaring maelstroms of alarm and uncertainty is their knack of submerging earlier and less dramatic passages in the lives of those whom Fate drags into their sweeping currents .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 46]: Lest , therefore , the strangely contrived meeting between Sylvia and her knight errant should be neglected by the chronicler , it is well to return to those two young people at the moment when Sylvia was declaring her unimpaired power of standing without support .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 14]: Trenholme was disposed to take everything for the best in a magic world .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 46]: `` Whatever is , is right '' is a doctrine which appeals to the artistic temperament , inasmuch as it blends fatalism and the action of Providence in proportions so admirably adjusted that no philosopher yet born has succeeded in reducing them to a formula .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 11]: But Eve did not bite the apple in that spirit .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 10]: It was forbidden : she wanted to know why .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 15]: Sylvia 's first thought was to discover a reasonable reason for Trenholme 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 39]: Of course , there was one that jumped to the eye , but it was too absurd to suppose that he had come to the tryst in obedience to the foolish vagaries which accounted for her own actions .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 28]: She blushed to the nape of her neck at the conceit , which called for instant and severe repression , and her voice reflected the passing mood .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 54]: `` I do n't wish to underrate the great service you have rendered me , '' she said coldly , `` and I shall always be your debtor for it ; but I can not help asking how you came to be standing under the cedars at this hour of the night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 8]: `` I wonder , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 42]: She wriggled her shoulder slightly , as a polite intimation that his hand need not rest there any longer , but he seemed to misinterpret the movement , and drew her an inch or so nearer , whereupon the wriggling ceased .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 73]: `` But that is no answer at all , '' she murmured , aware of a species of fear of this big , masterful man : a fear rather fascinating in its tremors , like a novice 's cringing to the vibration of electricity in a mildly pleasant form ; a fear as opposed to her loathing of Robert Fenley as the song of a thrush to the purr of a tiger .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 47]: `` I can tell you , in a disconnected sort of way , '' he said , evidently trying to focus his thoughts on a problem set by the gods , and which , in consequence , was incapable of logical solution by a mere mortal .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 7]: `` It was a fine night .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 4]: I felt restless .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 9]: The four walls of a room were prison-like .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 4]: I strolled out .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 6]: I was thinking of you .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 5]: I am here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 5]: She trembled a little .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 23]: Blushing even more deeply than before , she fancied he must be able to feel her skin hot through silk and linen .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 9]: For all that , she contrived to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 18]: `` It sounds convincing , but there is something missing in the argument , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 8]: `` Most likely , '' he admitted .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 12]: `` A woman analyzes emotion far more intimately than a man .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 33]: Perhaps , if you were to tell me why _ you _ were drawn to cross the park at midnight , you might supply a clue to my own moon madness . ''
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 21]: `` But there is n't any moon , and I think I ought to be returning to the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 41]: He knew quite well that she had evaded his question , and , so readily does the heart respond to the whisperings of hope , he was aware of a sudden tumult in that which doctors call the cardiac region .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 15]: She , too , had come forth to tell her longings to the stars !
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 21]: That thrice blessed picture had drawn them together by a force as unseen and irresistible as the law of gravitation !
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 9]: Then he became aware of a dreadful qualm .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 21]: Had he any right to place on her slim shoulders the weight of an avowal from which he had flinched ?
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 13]: He dropped that protecting hand as if it had been struck sharply .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 15]: `` I have annoyed you by my stupid word-fencing , '' he said contritely .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 25]: `` No , indeed , '' she said , and , reveling in a new sense of power , her tone grew very gentle .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 24]: `` Why should we seek far-fetched theories for so simple a thing as a stroll out of doors on a night like this ?
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 25]: I am not surprised that you , at any rate , should wish to visit the place where that delightful picture sprang into being .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 19]: It was my exceeding good fortune that you happened to be close at hand when I needed help .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 17]: I must explain that -- '' `` My explanation comes first , '' he broke in .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 8]: `` I saw you crossing the park .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 24]: A second time in the course of one day I had to decide whether to remain hidden or make a bolt for it .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 40]: Again I determined to stand fast ; for had you seen and heard a man vanishing among the trees you would certainly have been alarmed , not only because of the hour but owing to today 's extraordinary events .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 21]: Moreover , I felt sure you were coming to the lake , and I did not wish to stop you .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 11]: That was a bit of pure selfishness on my part .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 6]: I wanted you to come .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 20]: If ever a man was vouchsafed the realization of an unspoken prayer , I am that man tonight . ''
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 22]: Trenholme had never before made love to any woman , but lack of experience did not seem to trouble him greatly .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 24]: Sylvia , however , though very much alive to that element in his words , bethought herself of something else which they implied .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 11]: `` Then you heard what my cousin Robert said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 3]: she commented .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 4]: `` Every syllable .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 17]: When the chance of an effectual reply offered , I recalled his disjointed remarks collectively . ''
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 9]: `` Did you hit him very hard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 14]: `` Just hard enough to stop him from annoying you further tonight . ''
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 7]: `` I suppose he deserved it .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 4]: He was horrid .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 13]: But I do n't wish you to meet him again just now .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 12]: He is no coward , and he might attack you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 11]: `` That would be most unfortunate , '' he agreed .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 16]: `` So , if you do n't mind , we 'll take a roundabout way .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 20]: By skirting the Quarry Wood we can reach the avenue , near the place where we met this evening .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 5]: Do you remember ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 3]: `` Perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 10]: I shall be very old before I forget . ''
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 10]: `` But I mean the place where we met .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 15]: Of course , you could hardly pretend that you had forgotten meeting me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 12]: `` As soon would the daffodil forget where last it bloomed .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 19]: `` Daffodils , That come before the swallow dares , and take The winds of March with beauty .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 70]: `` Not that I should quote you ' A Winter 's Tale , ' but rather search my poor store for apter lines from ' A Midsummer Night 's Dream ' : `` I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows , Where ox-lips and the nodding violet grows ; Quite over-canopied with luxurious woodbine , With sweet musk roses , and with eglantine : There sleeps Titania .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 15]: `` Believe me , I have an excellent memory -- for some things . ''
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 27]: They walked together in silence a little way , and dreamed , perchance , that they were wandering in Oberon 's realm with Hermia and Lysander .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 32]: Then Sylvia , stealing a shy glance at the tall figure by her side , acknowledged that once she filled the r√¥le of Titania in a schoolroom version of the play .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 20]: `` We had no man , '' she said , `` but the masks and costumes served us well .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 14]: After a day 's study I could be a Fairy Queen once more .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 25]: `` I pray thee , gentle mortal , sing again ; Mine ear is much enraptured of thy note -- '' She stopped suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 7]: The next lines were distinctly amorous .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 16]: He laughed with ready appreciation of her difficulty , but generously provided a way out .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 5]: `` Poor mortal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 3]: he tittered .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 15]: `` And must I wear an ass 's head to be in character ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 27]: A loud report , and then another , brought them back rudely from a make-believe wood near Athens to a peril-haunted park in an English county .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 12]: For the second time that night Sylvia knew what fear meant .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 33]: Intuitively , she shrank close to the strong man who seemed destined to be her protector ; and when an arm clasped her again , she cowered close to its sheltering embrace .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 8]: `` Oh , what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 5]: she wailed in terror .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 29]: `` It is hard to say , '' he answered quietly , and the confidence in his voice was the best assurance of safety he could have given .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 29]: `` Those shots were fired from some sort of rifle , not of the same caliber as that which was used this morning , but unquestionably a rifle .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 9]: Perhaps it is one of these modern pistols .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 37]: I do n't wish to alarm you needlessly , Miss Manning , but there is some probability that the police have discovered the man who killed Mr. Fenley , and there is a struggle going on .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 13]: At any rate , let us remain out here in the open .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 10]: We shall be as safe here as anywhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 26]: Sylvia , who had not been afraid to venture alone into the park at midnight , was now in a quite feminine state of fright .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 16]: She clung to Trenholme without any pretense of other feeling than one of unbounded trust .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 15]: Her heart was pounding frantically , and she was trembling from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 36]: The police whistles were shrilling their insistent summons for help , and Trenholme knew that the commotion had arisen in the exact part of the Quarry Wood whence the murderous bullet had sped that morning .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 38]: He was unarmed , of course , being devoid of even such a mildly aggressive weapon as a walking-stick , but there was doubt in his mind that the best thing to do was to stand fast .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 38]: He was not blind to the possibility of imminent danger , for the very spot they had reached lay in a likely line of retreat for any desperado whom the police might have discovered and be pursuing .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 35]: Naturally he took it for granted that the criminal had fired the two shots , and the fact that the whistles were still in full blast showed that the chase had not been abandoned .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 16]: Still , the only course open was to take such chances as came their way .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 30]: He could always shield the girl with his own body , or tell her to lie flat on the ground while he closed with an assailant if opportunity served .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 20]: Being a level-headed , plucky youngster , he was by no means desirous of indulging in deeds of derring-do .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 43]: The one paramount consideration was the safe conduct of Sylvia to the house , and he hoped sincerely that if a miscreant were trying to escape , he would choose any route save that which led from the wood to Roxton village .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 29]: `` Do n't hesitate if I bid you throw yourself down at full length , '' he said , unconsciously stroking Sylvia 's hair with his free hand .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 13]: `` In a minute or two we 'll make for the avenue .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 6]: Meanwhile , let us listen .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 20]: If any one is coming in this direction we ought to hear him , and forewarned is forearmed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 15]: Choking back a broken question , she strove submissively to check her distressed sobbing .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 29]: Were it not for the hubbub of thousands of rooks and pheasants they would assuredly have caught the sounds of Hilton Fenley 's panic-stricken onrush through the trees .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 20]: As it was , he saw them first , and , even in his rabid frenzy , recognized Sylvia .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 31]: It was only to be expected that he should mistake Trenholme for his brother , and in a new spasm of fright , he recollected he was carrying the rifle .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 27]: Robert Fenley , of course , would identify it at a glance , and could hardly fail to be more than suspicious at sight of it .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 39]: With an oath , he threw the telltale weapon back among the undergrowth , and , summoning the last shreds of his shattered nerves to lend some degree of self-control , walked rapidly out into the open park .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 6]: Sylvia saw him and shrieked .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 33]: Trenholme was about to thrust her behind him , when some familiar attribute about the outline of the approaching figure caused her to cry -- `` Why , it 's Hilton ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 11]: `` Yes , Sylvia , '' came the breathless answer .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 9]: `` You heard the firing , of course ?
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 10]: The police have found some fellow in the wood .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 8]: You and Bob make for the avenue .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 15]: I 'm going this way in case he breaks cover for the Roxton gate .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 2]: Hurry !
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 9]: You 'll find some of the men there .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 5]: Never mind about me .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 7]: I 'll be all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 41]: He was running while he talked , edging away toward the group of cedars ; and , under the conditions , it was not for Trenholme to undeceive him as to the mistake in regarding the artist as Robert Fenley .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 52]: In any event , the appearance of Hilton from that part of the wood seemed to prove that the man whom the law was seeking could not be in the same locality , so Trenholme did not hesitate to urge Sylvia to fall in with her `` cousin 's '' instructions .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 33]: For the time , then , they may be left to progress uninterruptedly to safety and not very prompt enlightenment ; the flight of the self-confessed murderer calls for more immediate attention .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 37]: Probably , after the first moment of suspense , and when he was sure that escape was still not utterly impracticable , he intended to cross the park to the northwest and climb the boundary wall .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 12]: But a glimpse of the black line of trees daunted him .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 10]: He simply dared not face those pitiless sentinels again .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 32]: He pictured himself forcing a way through the undergrowth in the dense gloom and failing perhaps ; for the vegetation was wilder there than in any other portion of the estate .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 34]: So , making a d√©tour , he headed for the unencumbered parkland once more , and gained the wall near Jackson 's farm about the time that Trenholme and Sylvia entered the avenue .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 8]: He was unquestionably in a parlous state .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 34]: Bare-headed , unarmed , he could not fail to attract attention in a district where every resident knew the other , nor could he resist capture when the hue and cry went forth .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 7]: What to do he knew not .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 47]: Even if he managed to reach the railway station unchallenged , the last train of the day had left for London soon after eleven , and the earliest next morning was timed for five o'clock , too late by many hours to serve his desperate need .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 9]: Could he hire a motor car or bicycle ?
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 10]: The effort was fraught with every variety of risk .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 27]: There was a small garage at Easton , but those cunning detectives would be raising the countryside already , and the telephone would close every outlet .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 21]: For the first time in his life Hilton Fenley realized that the world is too small to hold a murderer .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 46]: He was free , would soon have the choice of a network of main roads and lanes in a rural district at the dead hour of the night , yet he felt himself securely caged as some creature of the jungle trapped in a pit .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 40]: Crossing Jackson 's farmyard , not without disturbing a dog just quieting down after the preceding racket , he hurried into the village street , having made up his mind to face the inevitable and arouse the garage keeper .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 41]: By the irony of fate he passed the cottage in which Police Constable Farrow was lying asleep and utterly unaware of the prevalent excitement , to join in which he would have kept awake all that night and the next .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 11]: Then the turn of Fortune 's wheel befriended Fenley again .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 26]: Outside a house stood Dr. Stern 's car , a closed-in runabout in which both the doctor and his chauffeur were sheltered from inclement weather .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 21]: The chauffeur was lounging on the pavement , smoking a cigarette , and Fenley , of course , recognized him .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 4]: His heart leaped .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 12]: Let him be bold now , and he might win through .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 29]: A handkerchief wiped some of the blood off his face where the skin had been broken by the trees , and he avoided the glare of the lamps .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 16]: `` Hello , Tom , '' he said , `` where is the doctor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 18]: `` Inside , sir , '' with a glance toward an upper room where a light shone .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 10]: `` What 's happened at The Towers , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 10]: Was it shooting I heard a while since ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 6]: A false alarm , though .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 14]: The police thought they had found some suspicious character in the grounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 13]: `` By jing , sir , did they fire at him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 14]: Fenley saw that the story was weak , and hastened to correct it .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 9]: `` No , no , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 8]: `` The police do n't shoot first .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 7]: That was my brother , Robert .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 9]: You know what a harebrained fellow he is .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 12]: Said he fired in order to make the man double back .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 7]: But that is a small matter .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 10]: Can I have one word with Dr. Stern ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 16]: `` I 'll see , sir , '' and the chauffeur went to the house .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 15]: Furneaux had estimated Hilton Fenley correctly in ascribing to him the quality of cold-bloodedness .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 41]: Ninety-nine men among a hundred would have appropriated the motor car then and there , but Fenley saw by waiting a minute and displaying the requisite coolness he might succeed in throwing his pursuers off the trail for some hours .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 3]: Stern came .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 20]: It chanced that he was watching a good patient through a crisis , and would be detained until daybreak .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 9]: `` Hello , Hilton , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 16]: `` What 's up now , and what 's the racket in the park ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 10]: Fenley explained , but hurried to the vital matter .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 12]: `` My car is out of action , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 18]: `` I was going to the Easton garage to hire one when I saw yours standing here .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 16]: Lend it to me for a couple of hours ; there 's a good fellow .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 11]: I 'll pay well for the use of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 3]: `` Pay ?
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 2]: Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 3]: Jump in !
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 11]: Take Mr. Fenley where he wants to go , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 7]: Where to first , Hilton ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 4]: `` St. Albans .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 5]: I 'm exceedingly obliged .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 12]: And look here , Stern , I insist on paying . ''
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 7]: `` We can settle that afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 4]: Off with you .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 8]: I 'll walk home , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 5]: Away sped the car .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 13]: Running through Easton , Fenley saw two policemen stationed at a cross-road .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 40]: They signaled the car to stop , and his blood curdled , but , in the same instant , they saw the chauffeur 's face ; the other occupant was cowering as far back in the shadow as possible .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 12]: `` Oh , it 's Dr. Stern , '' said one .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 5]: `` Right , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 18]: By the way , have you seen anything of -- '' `` Go on , do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 9]: growled Fenley , drowning the man 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 9]: `` I 'm in a vile hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 23]: That was his last real hairbreadth escape -- for that night , at any rate , though other thrills were in store .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 67]: The chauffeur was greatly surprised when bidden to go on from St. Albans to London , and take the High Barnet road to the City ; but Fenley produced a five-pound note at the right moment , and the man reflected that his master would not hesitate to oblige a wealthy client , who evidently meant to make good the wear and tear on the car .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 18]: In about an hour Fenley alighted on the pavement opposite the firm 's premises in Bishopsgate Street .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 35]: If a policeman had chanced to be standing there the fugitive would have known that the game was up , but the only wayfarers in that part of the thoroughfare were some street cleaners .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 23]: Now that he saw a glimmer of light where hitherto all was darkness , he was absolutely clear-brained and cool in manner .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 9]: `` Wait five minutes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 10]: `` I sha 'n' t detain you longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 20]: He let himself in with a master key , taken from his dead father 's pockets earlier by Tomlinson .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 19]: Going to the banker 's private office , he ransacked a safe and a cabinet with hasty method .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 40]: He secured a hat , an overcoat , an umbrella and a packed suitcase , left there for emergency journeys in connection with the business , and was back in the street again within less than the specified time .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 32]: His tongue clave to the roof of his mouth when he found a policeman chatting with the chauffeur , but the man saluted him with a civil `` Good morning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 44]: In the City of London , which is deserted as a cemetery from ten o'clock at night till six in the morning , the police keep a sharp eye on waiting cabs and automobiles between these hours , and invariably inquire their business .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 22]: This constable was quite satisfied that all was well when he saw Mr. Hilton Fenley , whom he knew by sight .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 21]: In any event , the flying murderer was safer than he dared hope in that place and at that time .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 54]: The Roxton telephonic system was temporarily useless in so far as it affected his movements ; for a fire had broken out at The Towers , and the flames of the burning roof had been as a beacon for miles around during the whole of the time consumed by the run to London .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 40]: CHAPTER XVI THE CLOSE OF A TRAGEDY Winter was in the Quarry Wood and feeling his way but trusting to hands and feet when he heard , and soon saw , Furneaux and the two constables coming toward him .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 22]: The little detective held the electric torch above his head , and was striding on without looking to right or left .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 9]: The bitterness of defeat was in his face .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 8]: Life had turned to gall and wormwood .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 13]: As the expressive American phrase has it , he was chewing mud .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 4]: The Superintendent smiled .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 9]: He knew what torment his friend was suffering .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 6]: `` Hello , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 17]: he said gruffly , and the three men jumped , for their nerves were on edge .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 13]: `` Oh , it 's you , Napoleon , '' yelped Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 21]: `` Behold Soult and his army corps , come to explain how Sir John Moore dodged him at Corunna . ''
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 10]: `` You 've lost your man , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 10]: `` Botched the job at the moment of victory .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 8]: And all through a rope end . ''
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 3]: `` Tush !
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 8]: That is n't in your line . ''
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 11]: `` Must I be lashed by your wit , too ?
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 12]: The rope was applied to me , not to Fenley . ''
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 31]: `` You do n't mean to say , sir , '' broke in one of the astounded policemen , `` that you think Mr. Hilton killed his own father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 13]: `` Was it you who got that punch in the tummy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 7]: `` Well , save your breath .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 9]: You 'll want it when the muscles stiffen .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 7]: _ ` Cr√© nom d'un pipe !
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 22]: _ To think that I , Furneaux of the Yard , should queer the finest pitch I ever stood on . ''
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 12]: `` Oh , come now , Charles , '' said Winter .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 8]: `` Do n't cry over spilt milk .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 11]: You 'll catch Fenley all right before the weather changes .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 5]: What really happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 28]: Aware of the paramount necessity of suppressing his personal woes , Furneaux at once gave a graphic and succinct account of Fenley 's imminent capture and escape .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 37]: He was scrupulously fair , and exonerated his assistants from any share of the blame -- if indeed any one could be held accountable for the singular accident which precipitated matters by a few vital seconds .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 49]: Had Fenley reached the ground before the torch revealed the detective 's presence , the latter would have closed with him instantly , throwing the torch aside , and thus taking the prisoner at the disadvantage which the fortune of war had brought to bear against the law .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 33]: Furneaux was wiry though slight , and he could certainly have held his man until re√´nforcements came ; nor would the constables ' lamps have been extinguished during the _ m√™l√©e _ .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 21]: `` Then he has vanished , rifle and all , '' said Winter , when Furneaux had made an end .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 9]: `` As though the earth had swallowed him .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 16]: A thousand years ago it would have done so , '' was the humiliated confession .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 14]: `` None of you have any notion which direction he took ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 22]: _ I _ received such a whack on the skull that I believe he disappeared in fire , '' said Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 52]: `` My friend here , '' turning to the policeman who had voiced his amazement at the suggestion that Hilton Fenley was a murderer , `` was in the position of Bret Harte 's negro lecturer on geology , while this other stalwart thought he had been kicked by a horse .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 12]: We soon recovered , but had to grope for each other .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 13]: Then I called the heavens to witness that I was dished . ''
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 15]: `` That gave us a chance of salvage , anyhow , '' said Winter .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 15]: `` I ` phoned the Roxton Inspector , and he will block the roads .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 20]: When he has communicated with St. Albans and some other centers we should have a fairly wide net spread .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 18]: Bates is coming from the lodge to take charge of a search party to scour the woods .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 5]: We want that rifle .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 7]: He must have dropped it somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 11]: He 'll make for a station in the early morning .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 16]: He dare n't tramp the country without a hat and in a black suit . ''
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 18]: Winter was trying to put heart into his colleague , but Furneaux was not to be comforted .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 16]: The truth was that the blow on the head had been a very severe one .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 19]: Unfortunately , he had changed his hard straw hat for a soft cap which gave hardly any protection .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 29]: Had Fenley 's perch been a few inches lower when he delivered that vindictive thrust , Scotland Yard would probably have lost one of its most zealous officers .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 36]: So the Jerseyman said nothing , having nothing to say that was fit for the ears of the local constabulary , and Winter suggested that they should return to the mansion and give Bates instructions .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 24]: Then he , Winter , would telephone Headquarters , have the main roads watched , and the early Continental trains kept under surveillance .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 12]: Furneaux , torch in hand , at once led the way .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 42]: Thus the party was visible before it entered the avenue , and two young people who had bridged months of ordinary acquaintance in one moment of tragedy , being then on the roadway , saw the gleam of light and waited .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 4]: `` Good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 11]: cackled the little detective when his glance fell on them .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 15]: `` I 'm glad to see there 's one live man in the bunch .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 14]: I presume you 've disposed of Mr. Robert Fenley , Mr. Trenholme ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' said the artist .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 9]: `` His affairs seem to be common property .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 21]: His brother evidently knew he was out of doors , and now you -- '' Furneaux woke up at that .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 4]: `` His brother !
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 12]: How can _ you _ know what his brother knew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 20]: `` Mr. Hilton Fenley saw Miss Manning and myself , and mistook me for -- '' `` Saw you ?
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 3]: When ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 15]: `` About five minutes ago , on the other side of the wood . ''
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 6]: `` What did he say ?
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 3]: Quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 23]: `` He told us that the shooting was the outcome of your efforts to catch some man hiding among the trees . ''
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 6]: `` Of my efforts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 9]: `` He did n't mention you by name .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 10]: The words he used were ` the police . '
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 12]: He was taking part in the chase , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 8]: `` Which way did he go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 3]: Trenholme hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 33]: Not only was he not quite conversant with the locality , but his shrewd wits had reached a certain conclusion , and he did not wish to be too outspoken before Sylvia .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 9]: Surely she had borne sufficient for one day .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 7]: Thereupon the girl herself broke in .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 7]: `` Hilton went toward the cedars .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 9]: He may be making for the Easton gate .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 7]: Have you caught any man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 21]: `` Not yet , Miss Manning , '' said Winter , assuming control of the situation with a firm hand .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 18]: `` I advise you to go straight to your room , and not stir out again tonight .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 13]: There will be no more disturbance -- I promise you that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 14]: Even the chief of the C. I. D. can err when he prophesies .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 13]: At that instant the two lines of trees lost their impenetrable blackness .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 29]: Their foliage sprang into red-tinted life as if the witches of the Brocken had chosen a new meeting-place , and a crackling , tearing sound rent the air .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 11]: screamed Sylvia , who chanced to be facing the mansion .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 8]: `` The house is on fire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 23]: They were standing in a group , almost where Police Constable Farrow had stood at ten minutes past ten the previous morning .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 36]: Hence they were aware of this addition to the day 's horrors before the house servants , who , headed by Tomlinson , were gathered on and near the flight of steps at the entrance .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 22]: Every female servant in the establishment was there as well , not outside the door , but quaking in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 13]: MacBain was the first among the men to realize what was happening .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 46]: He caught the loud clang of an automatic fire alarm ringing in his room , and at once called the house fire brigade to run out the hose while he dashed upstairs into the north corridor , from which a volume of smoke was pouring .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 5]: `` Good Heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 9]: he cried , on reaching the cross gallery .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 10]: `` It 's in Mr. Fenley 's rooms ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 5]: Mr. Fenley 's rooms !
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 12]: No need to tell the horrified staff which rooms he meant .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 13]: A fire was raging in the private suite of the dead man !
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 10]: The residence was singularly well equipped with fire-extinguishing appliances .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 7]: Mortimer Fenley had seen to that .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 35]: Hand grenades , producing carbonic acid gas generated by mixing water with acid and alkali , were stored in convenient places , and there was a plentiful supply of water from many hose pipes .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 44]: The north and south galleries looked on to an internal courtyard , so there was every chance of isolating the outbreak if it were tackled vigorously ; and no fault could be found with either the spirit or training of the amateur brigade .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 22]: Consequently , only two rooms , a bedroom and adjoining dressing-room , were well alight ; these were burned out completely .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 73]: A sitting-room on one side was badly scorched , as was a spare room on the other ; but the men soon knew that they had checked the further progress of the flames , and were speculating , while they worked , as to the cause of a fire originating in a set of empty apartments , when Parker , Mrs. Fenley 's personal attendant , came sobbing and distraught to Sylvia .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 6]: `` Oh , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 5]: `` Oh , miss !
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 6]: Where is your aunt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 10]: `` Is n't Mrs. Fenley in her room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 33]: asked the girl , yielding to a sense of neglect in not having gone to see if Mrs. Fenley was alarmed , though the older woman was not in the slightest danger .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 25]: The two main sections of the building were separated by an open space of forty feet , and The Towers had exceedingly thick walls .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 5]: `` No , miss .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 8]: I ca n't find her anywhere ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 17]: said the woman , well aware that if any one was at fault it was herself .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 8]: `` You know when I saw you .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 19]: I went back then , and she was sleeping , so I thought I could leave her safely .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 10]: Oh , miss , what has become of her ?
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 9]: Maybe she was aroused by the shooting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 37]: All hands that could be spared from the fire-fighting operations engaged instantly in an active search , but there was no clue to Mrs. Fenley 's disappearance beyond an open door and a missing night light .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 38]: The electric current was shut off at the main at midnight , except on a special circuit communicating with the hall , the courtyard , and MacBain 's den , where he had control of these things .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 23]: High and low they hunted without avail , until MacBain himself stumbled over a calcinated body in the murdered banker 's bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 11]: The poor creature had waked to some sense of disaster .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 61]: Vague memories of the morning 's horror had led her , night light in hand , to the spot where she fancied she would find the one person on earth in whom she placed confidence , for Mortimer Fenley had always treated her with kindness , even if his methods were not in accord with the commonly accepted moral code .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 20]: Presumably , on discovering that the rooms were empty , some further glimmering knowledge had stirred her benumbed consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 26]: She may have flung herself on the bed in a paroxysm of weeping , heedless of the overturned night light and the havoc it caused .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 38]: That , of course , is sheer guesswork , though the glass dish which held the light was found later on the charred floor , which was protected , to some extent , by a thick carpet .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 26]: At any rate , she had not long survived the husband who had given her a pomp and circumstance for which she was ill fitted .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 17]: They were buried in the same grave , and Hertfordshire sent its thousands to the funeral .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 20]: Soon after her fate became known , Winter wanted Furneaux , but his colleague was not in the house .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 57]: The telephone having broken down , owing to the collapse of a standard , and the necessity of subduing the fire having put a stop to any immediate search being made in the park , Winter thought that the pair of them would be better employed if they transferred their energies to the local police station .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 35]: He found Furneaux seated on the lowermost step at the entrance ; the Jerseyman was crying as if his heart would break , and Trenholme was trying to comfort him , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 7]: `` What 's up now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 27]: inquired the Superintendent , thinking at the moment that his friend and comrade was giving way to hysteria indirectly owing to the blow he had received .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 4]: Furneaux looked up .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 22]: It was the darkest hour of the night , and his chief could not see the distraught features wrung with pain .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 24]: `` James , '' he said , mastering his voice by a fierce effort , `` my mad antics killed that unfortunate woman !
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 7]: She was aroused by the shots .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 10]: She would cry for help , and none came .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 2]: Heavens !
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 6]: I can hear her now !
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 24]: Then she ran for refuge to the man who had been everything to her since she was a barrack room kid in India .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 7]: I 'm done , old fellow .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 3]: I resign .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 12]: I can never show my face in the Yard again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 28]: `` It 'll do you a world of good if you talk , '' said Winter , meaning to console , but unconsciously wounding by cruel sarcasm .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 31]: `` I 'll be dumb enough after this night 's work , '' said Furneaux , in a tone of such utter dejection that Winter began to take him seriously .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 39]: `` If you fail me now , Charles , '' he said , and his utterance was thick with anger at the crassness of things , `` I 'll consider the advisability of sending in my own papers .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 4]: Dash it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 26]: He said something quite different , but his friends may read this record , and they would repudiate an exact version with scorn and disbelief .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 16]: `` Are we going to admit ourselves beaten by a half-bred hound like Hilton Fenley ?
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 11]: Not if I know it , or I know you .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 39]: We 've got the noose ` round his neck , and you and I will pull it tight if we have to follow him to -- '' `` Pardon the interruption , gentlemen , '' said a voice .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 24]: `` I was called out o ' bed to come to the fire , an ' took a short cut across the park .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 13]: Blow me if I did n't kick my foot against this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 21]: And Police Constable Farrow , who had approached unnoticed , held out an object which seemed to be a rifle .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 25]: Owing to his being seated Furneaux 's eyes were on a level with it , and he could see more clearly than the others .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 32]: He struck a match ; then there could be no doubt that the policeman had actually picked up the weapon which had set in motion so many and such varied vicissitudes .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 7]: But Farrow had more to say .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 31]: It had been his happy lot during many hours to figure bravely in the Fenley case , and he carried himself as a valiant man and true to the end .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 15]: `` I think I heard you mention Mr. Hilton , '' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 23]: `` I met Dr. Stern in the village , an ' he tol ' me Mr. Hilton had borrowed his car . ''
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 4]: Furneaux stood up .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 22]: `` Continue , Solomon , '' he said , and Winter sighed with relief ; the little man was himself again .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 11]: `` That 's all , gentlemen , or practically all .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 34]: It struck me as unusual , but Dr. Stern said Mr. Hilton 's motor was out o ' gear , an ' he wanted a car in a desp ` rit hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 7]: `` He did , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 3]: growled Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 11]: `` You 're quite sure there is no mistake ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 5]: `` Mistake , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 5]: How could there be ?
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 7]: The doctor was walkin ' home .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 6]: That 's an unusual thing .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 11]: He never walks a yard if he can help it .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 12]: Mr. Hilton borrowed the car to go to St. Albans . ''
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 6]: `` Did he , indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 14]: Just how did he come to find the car waiting for him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 11]: `` Oh , that 's the queer part of it .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 48]: Dr. Stern is lookin ' after poor old Joe Bland , who 's mighty bad with -- there , now , if I have n't gone and forgotten the name ; something-itis -- and Mr. Hilton must have seen the car standin ' outside Bland 's house .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 13]: But what was he doin ' in Roxton at arf past twelve ?
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 6]: That 's wot beats me .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 14]: And then , just fancy me stubbin ' my toe against this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 17]: Again he displayed the rifle as if it were an exhibit and he were giving evidence .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 24]: `` Let 's go inside and get a light , '' said Winter , and the four mounted the steps into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 30]: Robert Fenley was there -- red-faced as ever , for he had helped in putting out the fire , but quite sober , since he had been very sick .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 17]: Some lamps and candles gave a fair amount of light , and Robert eyed Trenholme viciously .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 7]: `` So it was you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 6]: `` I thought it was .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 34]: Well , my father and mother are both dead , and this is no time for settlin ' matters ; but I 'll look you up when this business is all over . ''
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 15]: `` If you do , you 'll get hurt , '' said Winter brusquely .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 7]: `` Is that your rifle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 11]: and he pointed to the weapon in Farrow 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 6]: Where was it found ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 21]: `` In the Quarry Wood , sir , but a ` most in the park , '' said the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 8]: `` Has it been used recently ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 21]: Fenley could hardly have put a question better calculated to prove his own innocence of any complicity in the crime .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 29]: Winter took the gun , meaning to open the breech , but he and Furneaux simultaneously noticed a bit of black thread tied to one of the triggers .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 16]: It had been broken , and the two loose ends were some inches in length .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 9]: `` That settles it , '' muttered Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 67]: `` The scoundrel fixed it to a thick branch , aimed it carefully on more than one occasion -- look at the sights , set for four hundred yards -- and fired it by pulling a cord from his bedroom window when he saw his father occupying the exact position where the sighting practiced on Monday and Tuesday showed that a fatal wound would be inflicted .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 43]: The remaining length of cord was stronger than this packing thread , which was bound to give way first when force was applied ... Well , that side of the question did n't bother us much , did it , Winter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 11]: `` May I ask who you 're talking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 5]: inquired Robert Fenley hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 15]: `` About that precious rogue , your half brother , '' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 42]: `` That is why he went to his bedroom , one window of which looks out on the park and the other on the east front , where he watched his father standing to light a cigar before entering the motor .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 30]: He laid the cord before breakfast , knowing that Miss Manning 's habit of bathing in the lake would keep gardeners and others from that part of the grounds .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 54]: When the shot was fired he pulled in the cord -- '' `` I saw him doing that , '' interrupted Trenholme , who , after one glance at the signs of his handiwork on Robert Fenley 's left jaw , had devoted his attention to the extraordinary story revealed by the detectives .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 8]: `` You _ saw _ him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 8]: And Furneaux wheeled round in sudden wrath .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 12]: `` Why the deuce did n't you tell me that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 7]: `` You never asked me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 10]: `` How could I ask you such a thing ?
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 15]: Am I a necromancer , a wizard , or eke a thought reader ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 11]: Trenholme favored the vexed little man with a contemplative look .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 21]: `` I think you are all those , and a jolly clever art critic as well , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 9]: Furneaux was discomfited , and Winter nearly laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 14]: But the matter at issue was too important to be treated with levity .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 15]: `` Tell us now what you saw , Mr. Trenholme , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 22]: `` When the shot was fired , I recognized it as coming from a high-velocity rifle , '' said the artist .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 39]: `` I was surprised that such a weapon should be used in an enclosed park of this nature , and looked toward the house to discover whether or not any heed would be given to the incident there .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 41]: From where I was seated I could see the whole of the south front , but not the east side , where the brass fittings of the automobile alone were visible , glinting through and slightly above a yew hedge .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 31]: `` Now , when Miss Manning returned to the house and entered by way of a window on the ground floor , I noticed that no other window was open .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 47]: But after the report of the gun , I saw the end window of the first floor on the southeast side slightly raised -- say six inches ; and some one in the room was , as I regarded it , gesticulating , or making signs .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 10]: That continued nearly half a minute and then ceased .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 32]: I do n't know whether the person behind the glass was a man or a woman , but some one was there , and engaged in the way I have described .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 27]: If your theory is correct , the motions would be precisely those you suggest , similar to those of a fisherman reeling in a line . ''
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 12]: `` Your simile happens to be exact , '' said Winter .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 38]: `` While Hilton Fenley and my friend here were having a dust-up in the Quarry Wood I searched his rooms ; and among other things I came upon a salmon reel carrying an exceptional quantity of line .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 7]: So our case is fairly complete .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 37]: I 'm sorry to have to inform you , Mr. Fenley , that not only did your half brother kill your father , but he tried his level best to put the crime on your shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 11]: `` He overreached himself in sending for Scotland Yard men .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 22]: We have seen too much of the seamy side of life to accept as Gospel truth the first story we hear .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 20]: The very fact that Hilton Fenley was attacking you in your absence prejudiced us against him at the outset .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 21]: There were other matters , which I need not go into now , which converted our dislike into active suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 18]: `` But it is only fair that you should understand how narrow was your escape from arrest .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 23]: Had the local police been in sole charge I am bound to say you would have passed this night in a cell .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 21]: Luckily for you , Mr. Furneaux and I set our faces against the notion of your guilt from the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 16]: Long before we saw you , we were keeping an eye on the real criminal .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 16]: When you did appear , your conduct only confirmed our belief in your innocence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 14]: `` I told you why , you will remember , '' piped Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 7]: But Robert Fenley said no word .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 4]: He was stunned .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 13]: He began to feel ill again , and made for his room .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 14]: Sylvia had not been seen since she heard of Mrs. Fenley 's death .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 59]: The detectives collected their belongings , which with the gun and a bag packed with various articles taken from Hilton Fenley 's suite -- the reel , for instance , a suit of clothes bearing marks , possibly of moss , and the leather portfolio of papers -- were entrusted to Farrow and another constable for safe conveyance .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 9]: Accompanied by Trenholme , they walked to Easton .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 24]: On the way the artist supplied sufficient details of his two meetings with Sylvia to put them in possession of the main incidents .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 18]: Furneaux , though suffering from a splitting headache , had recovered the use of a vinegary tongue .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 11]: `` I was mistaken in you , '' he chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 7]: `` You 're a rank impressionist .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 26]: Indeed , you 're a neo-impressionist , a get-busy-and-do-it-now master of art ... But she 's a mighty nice girl , is n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 6]: `` Meaning Miss Manning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 4]: said Trenholme coldly .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 3]: Eliza . ''
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 3]: `` Sorry .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 5]: I misunderstood . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 5]: _ ` Cr√© nom !
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 8]: _ You 've got it bad . ''
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 6]: `` Got what bad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 5]: `` The matrimonial measles .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 7]: You 're sickening for them now .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 25]: One of the worst symptoms in the man is his curt refusal to permit anybody else to admire one bright particular star of womanhood .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 21]: If the girl hears another girl gushing over the young man , she 's ready to scratch her eyes out .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 3]: By Jove !
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 26]: It 'll be many a day before you forget your visit to Roxton Park this morning , or yesterday morning , or whenever it was .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 5]: `` I 'm mixed .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 11]: Life has been very strenuous during the past fifteen hours .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 79]: If you love me , James , put my poor head under a pump , or I 'll be dreaming that our lightning sketch performer here , long John Trenholme , late candidate for the P. R. A. , but now devoted to the cult of Hymen , is going to marry Eliza , of the White Horse , and that the fair Sylvia is pledged to cook us a dinner tomorrow night -- or is it tonight ?
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 10]: Oh , Gemini , how my head aches ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 18]: `` Do n't mind a word he 's saying , Mr. Trenholme , '' put in Winter .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 20]: `` Hilton Fenley hit him a smack with that rifle , and it developed certain cracks already well marked .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 47]: But he 's a marvelously ` cute little codger when you make due allowance for his peculiar ways , and he has a queer trick of guessing at future events with an accuracy which has surprised me more times than I can keep track of . ''
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 19]: Trenholme was too good a fellow not to put up with a little mild chaff of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 21]: He looked at the horizon , where the faint streaks of another dawn were beginning to show in the northeast .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 31]: `` Please God , '' he said piously , `` if I 'm deemed worthy of such a boon , I 'll marry Sylvia Manning , or no other woman .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 23]: And , when the chance offers , Eliza of the White Horse shall cook you a dinner to make your mouth water .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 16]: Thus will Mr. Furneaux 's dream come true , because dreams go by contraries ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 19]: CHAPTER XVII THE SETTLEMENT Winter tried to persuade his mercurial-spirited friend to snatch a few hours ' rest .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 38]: The Police Inspector obligingly offered a bed ; but short of a positive order , which the Superintendent did not care to give , nothing would induce Furneaux to let go his grip on the Fenley case .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 14]: `` Wait till the doctor 's car comes back , '' he urged .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 12]: `` The chauffeur will carry the story a few pages farther .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 18]: At any rate , we shall know where he dropped Fenley , and that is something . ''
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 17]: Winter produced a big cigar , and Trenholme felt in his pockets for pipe and tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 17]: `` No , you do n't , young man , '' said the big man firmly .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 13]: `` You 're going straight to your room in the White Horse .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 7]: And I 'll tell you why .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 15]: From what I have heard about the Fenleys , they were a lonely crowd .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 31]: Their friends were business associates and they seem to own no relatives ; while Miss Manning , if ever she possessed any , has been carefully shut away from them .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 12]: The position of affairs in The Towers will be strained tomorrow .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 43]: The elder Fenleys are dead ; one son may be in jail -- or , if he is n't , might as well be -- and the other , as soon as he feels his feet , will be giving himself airs .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 44]: Now , have n't you a mother or an aunt who would come to Roxton and meet Miss Manning , and perhaps help her to get away from a house which is no fit place for her to live in at present ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 21]: `` My mother can be here within an hour of the opening of the telegraph office , '' said Trenholme .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 17]: `` Write the telegram now , and the constable on night duty will attend to it .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 18]: When your mother arrives , tell her the whole story , and send her to Miss Manning .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 5]: Do n't go yourself .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 13]: You might meet Robert Fenley , and he would certainly be cantankerous .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 20]: If your mother resembles you , she will have no difficulty in arranging matters with the young lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 20]: `` If I resemble my mother , I am a very fortunate man , '' said the artist simply .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 15]: `` I thought it would be that way , '' was the smiling comment .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 24]: `` One other thing : I do n't suppose for a minute that Miss Manning is acquainted with a reputable firm of solicitors .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 39]: If she is , tell her to consult them , and get them to communicate with Scotland Yard , where I shall supply or leave with others certain information which should be acted on promptly in her behalf .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 33]: If , as I expect , she knows no lawyer , see that she takes this card to the address on it and give Messrs. Gibb , Morris & Gibb my message .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 4]: You understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 16]: `` Finally , she must be warned to say nothing of this to Robert Fenley .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 15]: In fact , the less that young spark knows about her affairs the better .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 21]: After tonight 's adventure that hint is hardly needed , perhaps ; but it is always well to be explicit .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 6]: Now off with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 6]: `` I 'm not tired .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 8]: Can I be of any service ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 18]: I want you to be ready for a long day 's work in Miss Manning 's interests .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 9]: Mr. Furneaux and I may be busy elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 16]: Unquestionably we shall not be in Roxton ; we may even be far from London .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 7]: Miss Manning will want a friend .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 17]: See to it that you start the day refreshed by some hours of sleep . '' '
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 8]: `` Good-by , '' said Trenholme promptly .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 10]: `` Sorry you two will miss Eliza 's dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 8]: But that is only a feast deferred .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 16]: By the way , if I leave Roxton I 'll send you my address . ''
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 12]: `` Do n't worry about that , '' smiled the Superintendent .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 12]: `` Our friend the Inspector here will keep tab on you .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 33]: Before you 're finished with inquests , police courts and assizes you 'll wish you 'd never heard the name of Fenley ... By Jove , I nearly forgot to caution you .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 10]: Not a word to the press ... Phi-ew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 3]: he whistled .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 21]: `` If they get on to this story in its entirety , wo n't they publish chapter and verse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 19]: So Trenholme went out into the village street and walked to his quarters in the White Horse Inn .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 19]: It was not yet two o'clock , but dawn had already silvered the northeast arc of the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 19]: Just twenty hours earlier an alarm clock had waked him into such a day as few have experienced .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 46]: Many a man has been brought unexpectedly into intimate touch with a tragedy of no personal concern , but seldom indeed do the Fates contrive that death and love and high adventure should be so closely bound , and packed pellmell into one long day .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 6]: Only to think of it !
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 28]: When he stole upstairs with the clock to play a trick on Eliza , he had never seen Sylvia nor so much as heard her name spoken .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 36]: When he sang of love and the dawn while striding homeward through the park , he had seen her , yet did not know her , and had no hope of ever seeing her again .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 24]: When he worked at her picture , he had labored at the idealization of a dream which bade fair to remain a dream .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 41]: And now by some magic jugglery of ordinary events , each well within the bounds of credibility , yet so overwhelmingly incredible in their sequence and completeness , he was Sylvia 's lover , her defender , her trusted knight-errant .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 19]: Even the concluding words of that big , round-headed , sensible detective had brought a fantasy nearer attainment .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 23]: If Sylvia were rich , why then a youngster who painted pictures for a living would hardly dare think of marrying her .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 43]: But if Sylvia were poor -- and Winter 's comments seemed to show that these financiers had been financing themselves at her expense -- what earthly reason was there that she should not become Mrs. John Trenholme at the earliest practicable date ?
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 6]: None that he could conceive .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 26]: Why , a fellow would have to be a fool indeed who did not know when he had met the one woman in the world !
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 17]: He had often laughed at other fellows who spoke in that way about the chosen one .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 12]: Now he understood that they had been wise and he foolish .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 30]: But suppose Sylvia -- oh , dash it , no need to spoil one 's brief rest by allowing a beastly doubt like that to rear its ugly head !
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 46]: One thing he was sure of -- Robert Fenley could never be a rival ; and Fenley , churl that he was , had known her for years , and could hardly be pestering her with his attentions if she were pledged to another man .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 75]: Moreover he , John , newly in love and tingling with the thrill of it , fancied that Sylvia would not have clung to him with such complete confidence when the uproar arose in the park if -- Well , well -- the history of the Fenley case will never be brought to an end if any attempt is made to analyze the effects of love 's first vigorous growth in the artistic temperament .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 27]: About a quarter past three Dr. Stern 's little landaulet was halted at the same cross-road where a policeman had stopped it nearly three hours earlier .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 7]: `` That you , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 4]: said the constable .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 9]: `` You 're wanted at the station . ''
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 5]: `` What station ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 4]: inquired the chauffeur .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 6]: `` The police station . ''
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 7]: `` Am I , by gum ?
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 5]: What 's up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 9]: `` The Scotland Yard men want you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 5]: `` But what for ?
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 12]: I have n't run over so much as a hen . ''
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 8]: `` Oh , it 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 7]: You 're wanted as a witness .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 4]: Never mind why .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 7]: _ They _ 'll tell you .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 14]: The doctor is there , smoking a cigar till you turn up . ''
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 10]: `` I left him at Joe Bland 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 10]: `` Joe Bland has left Boxton for Kingdom Come .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 8]: And The Towers is half burnt down .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 14]: Things have n't been happening while you were away , have they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 8]: `` Not half , '' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 18]: `` No , nor quarter , '' grinned the policeman to himself when the car moved on .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 33]: `` Wait till you know who you took on that trip , and why , and _ your _ sparkin ' - plug 'll be out of order for a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 34]: It was as well that the chauffeur had not the slightest notion that he had conveyed a murderer to London when he began to tell his tale to his employer and the detectives .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 12]: They wanted a plain , unvarnished story , and got it .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 20]: On leaving the offices in Bishopsgate Street , Fenley asked to be driven to Gloucester Mansions , Shaftesbury Avenue .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 22]: Tom had seen the last of him standing on the pavement , with a suitcase on the ground at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 17]: He was wearing an overcoat and a derby hat , and was pressing an electric bell .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 28]: `` He tol ' me I need n't wait , so I made for the Edgware Road ; an ' that 's all , '' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 7]: `` Cool as a fish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 3]: commented Furneaux .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 19]: `` Well , sir , I did n't get hot over it , '' said the surprised chauffeur .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 8]: `` I 'm not talking about you .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 8]: Could you manage another run to town ?
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 6]: Are you too tired ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 8]: The mystified Tom looked at his employer .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 4]: Dr. Stern laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 6]: `` Go right ahead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 10]: `` I 'm thinking of buying a new car .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 22]: A hundred and twenty miles in one night should settle the matter so far as this old rattletrap is concerned . ''
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 14]: `` Of course we 'll pay you , doctor , '' said Winter .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 16]: `` That 's more than Hilton Fenley will ever do , I 'm afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 8]: Tom tickled his scalp under his cap .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 13]: `` Mr. Hilton gemme a fiver , '' he said rather sheepishly .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 26]: There was something going on that he did not understand , but he thought it advisable to own up with regard to that lordly tip .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 12]: `` You 're a lucky fellow , '' said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 5]: `` What about petrol ?
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 13]: And do you feel able to take these gentlemen to London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 6]: Tom was a wiry person .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 16]: In five minutes he was on the road again bound for Scotland Yard this time .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 36]: As a matter of form a detective was sent to Gloucester Mansions , and came back with the not unforeseen news that Mrs. Garth was very angry at being disturbed at such an unearthly hour .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 15]: No ; she had seen nothing of Mr. Hilton Fenley since the preceding afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 40]: Some one had rung the bell about two o'clock that morning , but the summons was not repeated ; and she had not inquired into it , thinking that a mistake had been made and discovered by the blunderer .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 7]: Sheldon was brought from his residence .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 34]: He had a very complete report concerning Mrs. Lisle ; but that lady 's shadowy form need not flit across the screen , since Robert Fenley 's intrigues cease to be of interest .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 29]: He had dispatched her to France , urging that he must be given a free hand until the upset caused by his father 's death was put straight .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 33]: Suffice it to say that when he secured some few hundreds a year out of the residue of the estate , he married Mrs. Lisle , and possibly became a henpecked husband .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 13]: The Garths , too , mother and daughter , may be dropped .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 18]: There was no getting any restitution by them of any share of the proceeds of the robbery .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 14]: They vowed they were innocent agents and received no share of the plunder .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 29]: Miss Eileen Garth has taken up musical comedy , if not seriously at least zealously , and commenced in the chorus with quite a decent show of diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 16]: London was scoured next morning for traces of Hilton Fenley , but with no result .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 7]: This again fell in with anticipation .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 22]: The brain that could plan the brutal murder of a father was not likely to fail when contriving its own safety .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 28]: Somehow both Winter and Furneaux were convinced that Fenley would make for Paris , and that once there it would be difficult to lay hands on him .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 27]: Furneaux , be it remembered , had gone very thoroughly into the bond robbery , and had reached certain conclusions when Mortimer Fenley stopped the inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 13]: In pursuance of this notion they resolved to watch the likeliest ports .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 10]: Furneaux took Dover , Winter Newhaven and Sheldon Folkestone .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 29]: They did not even trouble to search the outgoing trains at the London termini , though a detailed description of the fugitive was circulated in the ordinary way .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 27]: Each man traveled by the earliest train to his destination and , having secured the aid of the local police , mounted guard over the gangways .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 19]: Furneaux drew the prize , which was only a just compensation for a sore head and sorer feelings .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 21]: He had changed his clothing , but adopted no other disguise than a traveling-cap pulled well down over his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 39]: He took it for granted that Fenley , like every other intelligent person going abroad , was aware that all persons leaving the country are subjected to close if unobtrusive scrutiny as they step from pier to ship .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 42]: Fenley , therefore , would have a sharp eye for the quietly dressed men who stand close to the steamer officials at the head of the gangway , but would hardly expect to find Nemesis hidden in the purser 's cabin .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 54]: Through a porthole Furneaux saw every face and , on the third essay , while the fashionable crowd which elects to pay higher rates for the eleven o'clock express from Victoria was struggling like less exalted people to be on board quickly , he found his man in the thick of the press .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 15]: Fenley had procured a new suit , a Homburg hat , and some baggage .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 34]: In fact , it was learned afterwards that he hired a taxi at Charing Cross , breakfasted at Canterbury , and made his purchases there at leisure , before driving on to Dover .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 29]: He passed between two uniformed policemen with the utmost self-possession , even pausing there momentarily to give some instruction to a porter about the disposition of his portmanteaux .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 19]: That was a piece of pure bravado , perhaps a final test of his own highly strung nerves .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 19]: The men , of course , were not watching him or any other individual in the hurrying throng .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 28]: They had a sharp eye for Furneaux , however , and when he nodded and hurried from his lair one of them grabbed Fenley by the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 34]: At that instant a burly German , careless of any one 's comfort but his own , and somewhat irritated by Fenley 's halt at the mouth of the gangway , brushed forward .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 32]: His weight , and Fenley 's quick flinching from that ominous clutch , loosed the policeman 's hold , and the murderer was free once more for a few fleeting seconds .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 13]: The constable pressed on , shoving the other man against the rail .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 3]: `` Here .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 28]: I want you , '' he said , and the quietly spoken words rang in Fenley 's ears as if they had been bellowed through a megaphone .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 14]: Owing to his own delay , there was a clear space in front .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 29]: He took that way of escape instinctively , though he knew he was doomed , since the ship 's officers would seize him at the policeman 's call .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 17]: Then he saw Furneaux , whose foot was already on the lower end of the gangway .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 8]: That , then , was the end !
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 6]: He was done for now .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 31]: All that was left of life was the ghastly progress of the law 's ceremonial until he was brought to the scaffold and hanged amidst a whole nation 's loathing .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 12]: His eyes met Furneaux 's in a glare of deadly malice .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 19]: Then he looked into eternity with daring despair , and dived headlong over the railing into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 14]: That awesome plunge created tremendous excitement among the bystanders on quay and ship .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 6]: It was seen by hundreds .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 11]: Men shouted , women screamed , not a few fainted .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 17]: A sailor on the lower deck ran with a life belt , but Fenley never rose .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 24]: His body was carried out by the tide , and was cast ashore some days later at the foot of Shakespeare 's Cliff .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 16]: Then the poor mortal husk made some amends for the misdeeds of a warped soul .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 57]: In the pockets were found a large amount of negotiable scrip , and no small sum in notes and gold , with the result that Messrs. Gibb , Morris & Gibb were enabled to recover the whole of Sylvia Manning 's fortune , while the sale of the estate provided sufficiently for Robert Fenley 's future .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 14]: The course of true love never ran smoother than for John and Sylvia .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 35]: They were so obviously made for each other , they had so determinedly flown to each other 's arms , that it did not matter tuppence to either whether Sylvia were rich or poor .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 17]: But it mattered a great deal when they came to make plans for a glorious future .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 13]: What a big , grand world it was , to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 10]: And how much there was to see in it !
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 9]: The Continent , America , the gorgeous East !
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 15]: They mapped out tours that would find them middle-aged before they neared England again .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 17]: Does life consist then , in flitting from hotel to hotel , from train to steamship ?
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 3]: Not it .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 9]: German Kultur took care to upset that theory .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 33]: John Trenholme is now a war-worn major in the Gunners , and Sylvia has only recently returned to her home nest after four years ' service with the Red Cross in France .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 6]: But these things came later .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 26]: One evening in the Autumn , Winter and Furneaux took Sheldon over to Roxton and dined with Dr. Stern and Tomlinson at the White Horse .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 13]: Tomlinson had bought the White Horse and secured Eliza with the fixtures .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 24]: Of course , there was talk of the Fenleys , and Winter told how Hilton Fenley 's mother had been unearthed in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 46]: She was a spiteful and wizened half-caste ; but she held her son dear , as mothers will , be they black or white or chocolate-colored , and it was to maintain her in an establishment of some style that he had begun to steal .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 22]: She had married again , and the man had gone through all her money , dying when there was none left .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 20]: She retained his name , however , and Fenley adopted it , too , during frequent visits to Paris .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 25]: Hence he was known there by a good many people , and could have sunk his own personality had he made good his escape .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 15]: The mother 's hatred of Mortimer Fenley had probably communicated itself to her son .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 37]: When she was told of Hilton 's suicide and its cause , she said that if anything could console her for his death it was the fact that he had avenged her wrongs on his father .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 11]: `` What was her grievance against poor Mortimer Fenley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 4]: inquired the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 24]: `` I knew him well , and he was a decent sort of fellow -- rather blustering and dictatorial but not bad-hearted . ''
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 11]: `` His success , I believe , '' said Winter .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 15]: `` They disagreed , and she divorced him , thinking he would remain poor .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 19]: The whirligig of time changed their relative positions , and to a jealous-minded woman that was unforgivable . ''
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 16]: `` The affair made a rare stir here anyhow , '' went on the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 35]: `` The people who have taken The Towers have not only changed the name of the place , but they have commissioned a friend of mine , an architect , to alter the entrance .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 26]: There will be two flights of steps and a covered porch , so the exact spot where Fenley fell dead will be built over . ''
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 13]: `` Gentlemen , '' said Tomlinson , `` talking is dry work .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 22]: I have n't my old cellar to select from , but I can recommend the brands you see on the table .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 15]: Mr. Furneaux , I 'm sure you have not forgotten that Ch√¢teau Yquem ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 21]: Then , and not until then , did the ex-butler hear that the detectives had never tasted his famous port .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 24]: His benign features were wrung with pain , for it was a wine of rare `` bowket , '' and hard to replace .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 16]: But Furneaux restored his wonted geniality by opening a parcel hitherto reposing on the sideboard .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 15]: `` I never sent you that bottle of Alto Douro , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 13]: `` Here it is -- a crusted quart for your own drinking .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 16]: Lest you should be tempted to be too generous tonight , I 've brought another .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 9]: Now -- a cradle and a corkscrew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 39]: So , after a dirge , and before the world shook in war , the story ends on a lively note , for what is there to compare with good wine and good cheer , each in moderation ?
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 12]: And one bottle among five is reasonable enough in all conscience .
