Parsing [sent. 1 len. 156]: A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens Book the First -- Recalled to Life I The Period It was the best of times , it was the worst of times , it was the age of wisdom , it was the age of foolishness , it was the epoch of belief , it was the epoch of incredulity , it was the season of Light , it was the season of Darkness , it was the spring of hope , it was the winter of despair , we had everything before us , we had nothing before us , we were all going direct to Heaven , we were all going direct the other way -- in short , the period was so far like the present period , that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received , for good or for evil , in the superlative degree of comparison only .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 44]: There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face , on the throne of England ; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face , on the throne of France .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 29]: In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes , that things in general were settled for ever .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 14]: It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 15]: Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period , as at this .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 39]: Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday , of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 39]: Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years , after rapping out its messages , as the spirits of this very year last past -LRB- supernaturally deficient in originality -RRB- rapped out theirs .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 56]: Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People , from a congress of British subjects in America : which , strange to relate , have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 34]: France , less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident , rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill , making paper money and spending it .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 76]: Under the guidance of her Christian pastors , she entertained herself , besides , with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off , his tongue torn out with pincers , and his body burned alive , because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view , at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 64]: It is likely enough that , rooted in the woods of France and Norway , there were growing trees , when that sufferer was put to death , already marked by the Woodman , Fate , to come down and be sawn into boards , to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it , terrible in history .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 67]: It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris , there were sheltered from the weather that very day , rude carts , bespattered with rustic mire , snuffed about by pigs , and roosted in by poultry , which the Farmer , Death , had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 49]: But that Woodman and that Farmer , though they work unceasingly , work silently , and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread : the rather , forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake , was to be atheistical and traitorous .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 18]: In England , there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 254]: Daring burglaries by armed men , and highway robberies , took place in the capital itself every night ; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers ' warehouses for security ; the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light , and , being recognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of `` the Captain , '' gallantly shot him through the head and rode away ; the mall was waylaid by seven robbers , and the guard shot three dead , and then got shot dead himself by the other four , `` in consequence of the failure of his ammunition : '' after which the mall was robbed in peace ; that magnificent potentate , the Lord Mayor of London , was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green , by one highwayman , who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue ; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeys , and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them , loaded with rounds of shot and ball ; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms ; musketeers went into St. Giles 's , to search for contraband goods , and the mob fired on the musketeers , and the musketeers fired on the mob , and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 96]: In the midst of them , the hangman , ever busy and ever worse than useless , was in constant requisition ; now , stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals ; now , hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday ; now , burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen , and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall ; to-day , taking the life of an atrocious murderer , and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer 's boy of sixpence .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 28]: All these things , and a thousand like them , came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 47]: Environed by them , while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded , those two of the large jaws , and those other two of the plain and the fair faces , trod with stir enough , and carried their divine rights with a high hand .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 37]: Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses , and myriads of small creatures -- the creatures of this chronicle among the rest -- along the roads that lay before them .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 32]: II The Mail It was the Dover road that lay , on a Friday night late in November , before the first of the persons with whom this history has business .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 22]: The Dover road lay , as to him , beyond the Dover mail , as it lumbered up Shooter 's Hill .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 91]: He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail , as the rest of the passengers did ; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise , under the circumstances , but because the hill , and the harness , and the mud , and the mail , were all so heavy , that the horses had three times already come to a stop , besides once drawing the coach across the road , with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 51]: Reins and whip and coachman and guard , however , in combination , had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument , that some brute animals are endued with Reason ; and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 34]: With drooping heads and tremulous tails , they mashed their way through the thick mud , floundering and stumbling between whiles , as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 20]: As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand , with a wary `` Wo-ho !
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 3]: so-ho-then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 29]: the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it -- like an unusually emphatic horse , denying that the coach could be got up the hill .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 23]: Whenever the leader made this rattle , the passenger started , as a nervous passenger might , and was disturbed in mind .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 32]: There was a steaming mist in all the hollows , and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill , like an evil spirit , seeking rest and finding none .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 35]: A clammy and intensely cold mist , it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another , as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 46]: It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings , and a few yards of road ; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it , as if they had made it all .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 20]: Two other passengers , besides the one , were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 16]: All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears , and wore jack-boots .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 52]: Not one of the three could have said , from anything he saw , what either of the other two was like ; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind , as from the eyes of the body , of his two companions .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 31]: In those days , travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice , for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 40]: As to the latter , when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in `` the Captain 's '' pay , ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript , it was the likeliest thing upon the cards .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 81]: So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself , that Friday night in November , one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five , lumbering up Shooter 's Hill , as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail , beating his feet , and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him , where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols , deposited on a substratum of cutlass .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 69]: The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers , the passengers suspected one another and the guard , they all suspected everybody else , and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses ; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the journey .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 4]: `` Wo-ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 4]: said the coachman .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 5]: `` So , then !
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 27]: One more pull and you 're at the top and be damned to you , for I have had trouble enough to get you to it !
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 4]: -- Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 4]: `` Halloa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 4]: the guard replied .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 11]: `` What o'clock do you make it , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 10]: `` Ten minutes , good , past eleven . ''
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 5]: `` My blood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 14]: ejaculated the vexed coachman , `` and not atop of Shooter 's yet !
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 2]: Tst !
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 2]: Yah !
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 6]: Get on with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 30]: The emphatic horse , cut short by the whip in a most decided negative , made a decided scramble for it , and the three other horses followed suit .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 21]: Once more , the Dover mail struggled on , with the jack-boots of its passengers squashing along by its side .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 16]: They had stopped when the coach stopped , and they kept close company with it .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 43]: If any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness , he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 13]: The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 30]: The horses stopped to breathe again , and the guard got down to skid the wheel for the descent , and open the coach-door to let the passengers in .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 3]: `` Tst !
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 3]: Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 14]: cried the coachman in a warning voice , looking down from his box .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 9]: `` What do you say , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 4]: They both listened .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 14]: `` I say a horse at a canter coming up , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 30]: `` I say a horse at a gallop , Tom , '' returned the guard , leaving his hold of the door , and mounting nimbly to his place .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 3]: `` Gentlemen !
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 10]: In the kings name , all of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 16]: With this hurried adjuration , he cocked his blunderbuss , and stood on the offensive .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 29]: The passenger booked by this history , was on the coach-step , getting in ; the two other passengers were close behind him , and about to follow .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 23]: He remained on the step , half in the coach and half out of ; they re-mained in the road below him .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 21]: They all looked from the coachman to the guard , and from the guard to the coachman , and listened .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 26]: The coachman looked back and the guard looked back , and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back , without contradicting .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 29]: The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach , added to the stillness of the night , made it very quiet indeed .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 23]: The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach , as if it were in a state of agitation .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 43]: The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard ; but at any rate , the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath , and holding the breath , and having the pulses quickened by expectation .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 16]: The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 4]: `` So-ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 12]: the guard sang out , as loud as he could roar .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 4]: `` Yo there !
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 2]: Stand !
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 5]: I shall fire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 31]: The pace was suddenly checked , and , with much splashing and floundering , a man 's voice called from the mist , `` Is that the Dover mail ? ''
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 9]: `` Never you mind what it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 4]: the guard retorted .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 6]: `` What are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 8]: `` IS that the Dover mail ? ''
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 9]: `` Why do you want to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 11]: `` I want a passenger , if it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 5]: `` What passenger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 6]: `` Mr. Jarvis Lorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 13]: Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 15]: The guard , the coachman , and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 37]: `` Keep where you are , '' the guard called to the voice in the mist , `` because , if I should make a mistake , it could never be set right in your lifetime .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 10]: Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight . ''
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 7]: `` What is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 11]: asked the passenger , then , with mildly quavering speech .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 5]: `` Who wants me ?
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 5]: Is it Jerry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 22]: -LRB- `` I do n't like Jerry 's voice , if it is Jerry , '' growled the guard to himself .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 13]: `` He 's hoarser than suits me , is Jerry . '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 7]: `` Yes , Mr. Lorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 7]: `` What is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 10]: `` A despatch sent after you from over yonder .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 53]: T. and Co. '' `` I know this messenger , guard , '' said Mr. Lorry , getting down into the road -- assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two passengers , who immediately scrambled into the coach , shut the door , and pulled up the window .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 12]: `` He may come close ; there 's nothing wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 28]: `` I hope there ai n't , but I ca n't make so ` Nation sure of that , '' said the guard , in gruff soliloquy .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 5]: `` Hallo you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 5]: And hallo you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 8]: said Jerry , more hoarsely than before .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 7]: `` Come on at a footpace !
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 4]: d'ye mind me ?
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 24]: And if you 've got holsters to that saddle o ' yourn , do n't let me see your hand go nigh 'em .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 22]: For I 'm a devil at a quick mistake , and when I make one it takes the form of Lead .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 9]: So now let 's look at you . ''
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 28]: The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist , and came to the side of the mail , where the passenger stood .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 22]: The rider stooped , and , casting up his eyes at the guard , handed the passenger a small folded paper .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 30]: The rider 's horse was blown , and both horse and rider were covered with mud , from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of the man .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 4]: `` Guard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 12]: said the passenger , in a tone of quiet business confidence .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 36]: The watchful guard , with his right hand at the stock of his raised blunderbuss , his left at the barrel , and his eye on the horseman , answered curtly , `` Sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 7]: `` There is nothing to apprehend .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 7]: I belong to Tellson 's Bank .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 9]: You must know Tellson 's Bank in London .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 8]: I am going to Paris on business .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 5]: A crown to drink .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 6]: I may read this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 12]: `` If so be as you 're quick , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 34]: He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side , and read -- first to himself and then aloud : '' ` Wait at Dover for Mam ` selle . '
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 10]: It 's not long , you see , guard .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 13]: Jerry , say that my answer was , RECALLED TO LIFE . ''
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 6]: Jerry started in his saddle .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 18]: `` That 's a Blazing strange answer , too , '' said he , at his hoarsest .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 22]: `` Take that message back , and they will know that I received this , as well as if I wrote .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 7]: Make the best of your way .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 4]: Good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 43]: With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in ; not at all assisted by his fellow-passengers , who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots , and were now making a general pretence of being asleep .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 18]: With no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 20]: The coach lumbered on again , with heavier wreaths of mist closing round it as it began the descent .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 63]: The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss in his arm-chest , and , having looked to the rest of its contents , and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt , looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat , in which there were a few smith 's tools , a couple of torches , and a tinder-box .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 62]: For he was furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown and stormed out , which did occasionally happen , he had only to shut himself up inside , keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw , and get a light with tolerable safety and ease -LRB- if he were lucky -RRB- in five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 4]: `` Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 6]: softly over the coach roof .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 6]: `` Hallo , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 8]: `` Did you hear the message ? ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 7]: `` I did , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 11]: `` What did you make of it , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 8]: `` Nothing at all , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 24]: `` That 's a coincidence , too , '' the guard mused , `` for I made the same of it myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 50]: Jerry , left alone in the mist and darkness , dismounted meanwhile , not only to ease his spent horse , but to wipe the mud from his face , and shake the wet out of his hat-brim , which might be capable of holding about half a gallon .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 37]: After standing with the bridle over his heavily-splashed arm , until the wheels of the mail were no longer within hearing and the night was quite still again , he turned to walk down the hill .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 38]: `` After that there gallop from Temple Bar , old lady , I wo n't trust your fore-legs till I get you on the level , '' said this hoarse messenger , glancing at his mare . ''
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 6]: ` Recalled to life . '
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 7]: That 's a Blazing strange message .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 11]: Much of that would n't do for you , Jerry !
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 5]: I say , Jerry !
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 22]: You 'd be in a Blazing bad way , if recalling to life was to come into fashion , Jerry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 28]: III The Night Shadows A wonderful fact to reflect upon , that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 68]: A solemn consideration , when I enter a great city by night , that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret ; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret ; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there , is , in some of its imaginings , a secret to the heart nearest it !
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 15]: Something of the awfulness , even of Death itself , is referable to this .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 25]: No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved , and vainly hope in time to read it all .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 34]: No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable water , wherein , as momentary lights glanced into it , I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 26]: It was appointed that the book should shut with a spring , for ever and for ever , when I had read but a page .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 32]: It was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost , when the light was playing on its surface , and I stood in ignorance on the shore .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 52]: My friend is dead , my neighbour is dead , my love , the darling of my soul , is dead ; it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality , and which I shall carry in mine to my life 's end .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 40]: In any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass , is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are , in their innermost personality , to me , or than I am to them ?
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 39]: As to this , his natural and not to be alienated inheritance , the messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King , the first Minister of State , or the richest merchant in London .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 58]: So with the three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail coach ; they were mysteries to one another , as complete as if each had been in his own coach and six , or his own coach and sixty , with the breadth of a county between him and the next .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 40]: The messenger rode back at an easy trot , stopping pretty often at ale-houses by the way to drink , but evincing a tendency to keep his own counsel , and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 53]: He had eyes that assorted very well with that decoration , being of a surface black , with no depth in the colour or form , and much too near together -- as if they were afraid of being found out in something , singly , if they kept too far apart .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 35]: They had a sinister expression , under an old cocked-hat like a three-cornered spittoon , and over a great muffler for the chin and throat , which descended nearly to the wearer 's knees .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 37]: When he stopped for drink , he moved this muffler with his left hand , only while he poured his liquor in with his right ; as soon as that was done , he muffled again .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 8]: `` No , Jerry , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 12]: said the messenger , harping on one theme as he rode .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 10]: `` It would n't do for you , Jerry .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 15]: Jerry , you honest tradesman , it would n't suit YOUR line of business !
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 3]: Recalled -- !
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 14]: Bust me if I do n't think he 'd been a drinking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 26]: His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain , several times , to take off his hat to scratch his head .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 35]: Except on the crown , which was raggedly bald , he had stiff , black hair , standing jaggedly all over it , and growing down hill almost to his broad , blunt nose .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 49]: It was so like Smith 's work , so much more like the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair , that the best of players at leap-frog might have declined him , as the most dangerous man in the world to go over .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 74]: While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night watchman in his box at the door of Tellson 's Bank , by Temple Bar , who was to deliver it to greater authorities within , the shadows of the night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message , and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of HER private topics of uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 16]: They seemed to be numerous , for she shied at every shadow on the road .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 24]: What time , the mail-coach lumbered , jolted , rattled , and bumped upon its tedious way , with its three fellow-inscrutables inside .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 24]: To whom , likewise , the shadows of the night revealed themselves , in the forms their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 12]: Tellson 's Bank had a run upon it in the mail .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 86]: As the bank passenger -- with an arm drawn through the leathern strap , which did what lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger , and driving him into his corner , whenever the coach got a special jolt -- nodded in his place , with half-shut eyes , the little coach-windows , and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them , and the bulky bundle of opposite passenger , became the bank , and did a great stroke of business .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 39]: The rattle of the harness was the chink of money , and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson 's , with all its foreign and home connection , ever paid in thrice the time .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 78]: Then the strong-rooms underground , at Tellson 's , with such of their valuable stores and secrets as were known to the passenger -LRB- and it was not a little that he knew about them -RRB- , opened before him , and he went in among them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle , and found them safe , and strong , and sound , and still , just as he had last seen them .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 52]: But , though the bank was almost always with him , and though the coach -LRB- in a confused way , like the presence of pain under an opiate -RRB- was always with him , there was another current of impression that never ceased to run , all through the night .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 14]: He was on his way to dig some one out of a grave .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 66]: Now , which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him was the true face of the buried person , the shadows of the night did not indicate ; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by years , and they differed principally in the passions they expressed , and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 31]: Pride , contempt , defiance , stubbornness , submission , lamentation , succeeded one another ; so did varieties of sunken cheek , cadaverous colour , emaciated hands and figures .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 17]: But the face was in the main one face , and every head was prematurely white .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 17]: A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this spectre : `` Buried how long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 13]: The answer was always the same : `` Almost eighteen years . ''
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 12]: `` You had abandoned all hope of being dug out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 5]: `` Long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 11]: `` You know that you are recalled to life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 7]: `` They tell me so . ''
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 9]: `` I hope you care to live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 7]: `` I ca n't say . ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 8]: `` Shall I show her to you ?
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 8]: Will you come and see her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 10]: The answers to this question were various and contradictory .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 9]: Sometimes the broken reply was , `` Wait !
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 12]: It would kill me if I saw her too soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 24]: Sometimes , it was given in a tender rain of tears , and then it was , `` Take me to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 19]: Sometimes it was staring and bewildered , and then it was , `` I do n't know her .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 6]: I do n't understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 41]: After such imaginary discourse , the passenger in his fancy would dig , and dig , dig -- now with a spade , now with a great key , now with his hands -- to dig this wretched creature out .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 22]: Got out at last , with earth hanging about his face and hair , he would suddenly fan away to dust .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 25]: The passenger would then start to himself , and lower the window , to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 50]: Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain , on the moving patch of light from the lamps , and the hedge at the roadside retreating by jerks , the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the night shadows within .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 38]: The real Banking-house by Temple Bar , the real business of the past day , the real strong rooms , the real express sent after him , and the real message returned , would all be there .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 20]: Out of the midst of them , the ghostly face would rise , and he would accost it again .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 6]: `` Buried how long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 6]: `` Almost eighteen years . ''
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 9]: `` I hope you care to live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 7]: `` I ca n't say . ''
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 63]: Dig -- dig -- dig -- until an impatient movement from one of the two passengers would admonish him to pull up the window , draw his arm securely through the leathern strap , and speculate upon the two slumbering forms , until his mind lost its hold of them , and they again slid away into the bank and the grave .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 6]: `` Buried how long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 6]: `` Almost eighteen years . ''
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 12]: `` You had abandoned all hope of being dug out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 5]: `` Long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 47]: The words were still in his hearing as just spoken -- distinctly in his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life -- when the weary passenger started to the consciousness of daylight , and found that the shadows of the night were gone .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 13]: He lowered the window , and looked out at the rising sun .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 48]: There was a ridge of ploughed land , with a plough upon it where it had been left last night when the horses were unyoked ; beyond , a quiet coppice-wood , in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained upon the trees .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 24]: Though the earth was cold and wet , the sky was clear , and the sun rose bright , placid , and beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 5]: `` Eighteen years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 9]: said the passenger , looking at the sun .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 6]: `` Gracious Creator of day !
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 9]: To be buried alive for eighteen years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 34]: IV The Preparation When the mail got successfully to Dover , in the course of the forenoon , the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his custom was .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 27]: He did it with some flourish of ceremony , for a mail journey from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 28]: By that time , there was only one adventurous traveller left be congratulated : for the two others had been set down at their respective roadside destinations .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 29]: The mildewy inside of the coach , with its damp and dirty straw , its disageeable smell , and its obscurity , was rather like a larger dog-kennel .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 38]: Mr. Lorry , the passenger , shaking himself out of it in chains of straw , a tangle of shaggy wrapper , flapping hat , and muddy legs , was rather like a larger sort of dog .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 14]: `` There will be a packet to Calais , tomorrow , drawer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 16]: `` Yes , sir , if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 15]: The tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon , sir .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 5]: Bed , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 21]: `` I shall not go to bed till night ; but I want a bedroom , and a barber . ''
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 7]: `` And then breakfast , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 4]: Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 9]: That way , sir , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 3]: Show Concord !
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 9]: Gentleman 's valise and hot water to Concord .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 8]: Pull off gentleman 's boots in Concord .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 12]: -LRB- You will find a fine sea-coal fire , sir . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 5]: Fetch barber to Concord .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 10]: Stir about there , now , for Concord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 67]: The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the mail , and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from head to foot , the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the Royal George , that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it , all kinds and varieties of men came out of it .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 78]: Consequently , another drawer , and two porters , and several maids and the landlady , were all loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord and the coffee-room , when a gentleman of sixty , formally dressed in a brown suit of clothes , pretty well worn , but very well kept , with large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets , passed along on his way to his breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 16]: The coffee-room had no other occupant , that forenoon , than the gentleman in brown .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 40]: His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire , and as he sat , with its light shining on him , waiting for the meal , he sat so still , that he might have been sitting for his portrait .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 45]: Very orderly and methodical he looked , with a hand on each knee , and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist-coat , as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and evanescence of the brisk fire .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 43]: He had a good leg , and was a little vain of it , for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close , and were of a fine texture ; his shoes and buckles , too , though plain , were trim .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 48]: He wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig , setting very close to his head : which wig , it is to be presumed , was made of hair , but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 44]: His linen , though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings , was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach , or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 50]: A face habitually suppressed and quieted , was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost their owner , in years gone by , some pains to drill to the composed and reserved expression of Tellson 's Bank .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 22]: He had a healthy colour in his cheeks , and his face , though lined , bore few traces of anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 36]: But , perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson 's Bank were principally occupied with the cares of other people ; and perhaps second-hand cares , like second-hand clothes , come easily off and on .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 20]: Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait , Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 41]: The arrival of his breakfast roused him , and he said to the drawer , as he moved his chair to it : `` I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any time to-day .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 21]: She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry , or she may only ask for a gentleman from Tellson 's Bank .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 7]: Please to let me know . ''
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 9]: Tellson 's Bank in London , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 22]: We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris , sir .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 16]: A vast deal of travelling , sir , in Tellson and Company 's House . ''
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 15]: We are quite a French House , as well as an English one . ''
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 16]: Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself , I think , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 6]: `` Not of late years .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 16]: It is fifteen years since we -- since I -- came last from France . ''
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 5]: `` Indeed , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 9]: That was before my time here , sir .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 9]: Before our people 's time here , sir .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 13]: The George was in other hands at that time , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 6]: `` I believe so . ''
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 35]: `` But I would hold a pretty wager , sir , that a House like Tellson and Company was flourishing , a matter of fifty , not to speak of fifteen years ago ? ''
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 22]: `` You might treble that , and say a hundred and fifty , yet not be far from the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 6]: `` Indeed , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 53]: Rounding his mouth and both his eyes , as he stepped backward from the table , the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left , dropped into a comfortable attitude , and stood surveying the guest while he ate and drank , as from an observatory or watchtower .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 11]: According to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 18]: When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast , he went out for a stroll on the beach .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 29]: The little narrow , crooked town of Dover hid itself away from the beach , and ran its head into the chalk cliffs , like a marine ostrich .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 30]: The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about , and the sea did what it liked , and what it liked was destruction .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 20]: It thundered at the town , and thundered at the cliffs , and brought the coast down , madly .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 39]: The air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it , as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 36]: A little fishing was done in the port , and a quantity of strolling about by night , and looking seaward : particularly at those times when the tide made , and was near flood .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 29]: Small tradesmen , who did no business whatever , sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes , and it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 45]: As the day declined into the afternoon , and the air , which had been at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen , became again charged with mist and vapour , Mr. Lorry 's thoughts seemed to cloud too .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 39]: When it was dark , and he sat before the coffee-room fire , awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast , his mind was busily digging , digging , digging , in the live red coals .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 31]: A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no harm , otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 67]: Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time , and had just poured out his last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle , when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow street , and rumbled into the inn-yard .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 7]: He set down his glass untouched .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 8]: `` This is Mam ` selle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 31]: In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette had arrived from London , and would be happy to see the gentleman from Tellson 's .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 5]: `` So soon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 36]: Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road , and required none then , and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson 's immediately , if it suited his pleasure and convenience .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 42]: The gentleman from Tellson 's had nothing left for it but to empty his glass with an air of stolid desperation , settle his odd little flaxen wig at the ears , and follow the waiter to Miss Manette 's apartment .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 24]: It was a large , dark room , furnished in a funereal manner with black horsehair , and loaded with heavy dark tables .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 58]: These had been oiled and oiled , until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf ; as if THEY were buried , in deep graves of black mahogany , and no light to speak of could be expected from them until they were dug out .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 86]: The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry , picking his way over the well-worn Turkey carpet , supposed Miss Manette to be , for the moment , in some adjacent room , until , having got past the two tall candles , he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and the fire , a young lady of not more than seventeen , in a riding-cloak , and still holding her straw travelling-hat by its ribbon in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 135]: As his eyes rested on a short , slight , pretty figure , a quantity of golden hair , a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look , and a forehead with a singular capacity -LRB- remembering how young and smooth it was -RRB- , of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was not quite one of perplexity , or wonder , or alarm , or merely of a bright fixed attention , though it included all the four expressions-as his eyes rested on these things , a sudden vivid likeness passed before him , of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very Channel , one cold time , when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran high .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 61]: The likeness passed away , like a breath along the surface of the gaunt pier-glass behind her , on the frame of which , a hospital procession of negro cupids , several headless and all cripples , were offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the feminine gender-and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 9]: `` Pray take a seat , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 22]: In a very clear and pleasant young voice ; a little foreign in its accent , but a very little indeed .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 34]: `` I kiss your hand , miss , '' said Mr. Lorry , with the manners of an earlier date , as he made his formal bow again , and took his seat .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 39]: `` I received a letter from the Bank , sir , yesterday , informing me that some intelligence -- or discovery -- '' `` The word is not material , miss ; either word will do . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 40]: -- respecting the small property of my poor father , whom I never saw -- so long dead -- '' Mr. Lorry moved in his chair , and cast a troubled look towards the hospital procession of negro cupids .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 14]: As if THEY had any help for anybody in their absurd baskets ! ''
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 34]: -- rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris , there to communicate with a gentleman of the Bank , so good as to be despatched to Paris for the purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 4]: `` Myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 11]: `` As I was prepared to hear , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 35]: She curtseyed to him -LRB- young ladies made curtseys in those days -RRB- , with a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he was than she .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 6]: He made her another bow .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 80]: `` I replied to the Bank , sir , that as it was considered necessary , by those who know , and who are so kind as to advise me , that I should go to France , and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with me , I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself , during the journey , under that worthy gentleman 's protection .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 27]: The gentleman had left London , but I think a messenger was sent after him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here . ''
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 18]: `` I was happy , '' said Mr. Lorry , `` to be entrusted with the charge .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 10]: I shall be more happy to execute it . ''
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 8]: `` Sir , I thank you indeed .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 6]: I thank you very gratefully .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 34]: It was told me by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the business , and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising nature .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 25]: I have done my best to prepare myself , and I naturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are . ''
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 8]: `` Naturally , '' said Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 32]: `` Yes -- I -- '' After a pause , he added , again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the ears , `` It is very difficult to begin . ''
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 15]: He did not begin , but , in his indecision , met her glance .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 43]: The young forehead lifted itself into that singular expression -- but it was pretty and characteristic , besides being singular -- and she raised her hand , as if with an involuntary action she caught at , or stayed some passing shadow .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 12]: `` Are you quite a stranger to me , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 6]: `` Am I not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 15]: Mr. Lorry opened his hands , and extended them outwards with an argumentative smile .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 48]: Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose , the line of which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be , the expression deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which she had hitherto remained standing .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 46]: He watched her as she mused , and the moment she raised her eyes again , went on : `` In your adopted country , I presume , I can not do better than address you as a young English lady , Miss Manette ? ''
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 8]: `` If you please , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 11]: `` Miss Manette , I am a man of business .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 10]: I have a business charge to acquit myself of .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 26]: In your reception of it , do n't heed me any more than if I was a speaking machine-truly , I am not much else .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 22]: I will , with your leave , relate to you , miss , the story of one of our customers . ''
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 4]: `` Story ! ''
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 36]: He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated , when he added , in a hurry , `` Yes , customers ; in the banking business we usually call our connection our customers .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 20]: He was a French gentleman ; a scientific gentleman ; a man of great acquirements -- a Doctor . ''
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 6]: `` Not of Beauvais ? ''
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 8]: `` Why , yes , of Beauvais .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 13]: Like Monsieur Manette , your father , the gentleman was of Beauvais .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 15]: Like Monsieur Manette , your father , the gentleman was of repute in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 9]: I had the honour of knowing him there .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 9]: Our relations were business relations , but confidential .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 16]: I was at that time in our French House , and had been -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 4]: twenty years . ''
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 16]: `` At that time -- I may ask , at what time , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 11]: `` I speak , miss , of twenty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 15]: He married -- an English lady -- and I was one of the trustees .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 22]: His affairs , like the affairs of many other French gentlemen and French families , were entirely in Tellson 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 24]: In a similar way I am , or I have been , trustee of one kind or other for scores of our customers .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 23]: These are mere business relations , miss ; there is no friendship in them , no particular interest , nothing like sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 49]: I have passed from one to another , in the course of my business life , just as I pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my business day ; in short , I have no feelings ; I am a mere machine .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 61]: To go on -- '' `` But this is my father 's story , sir ; and I begin to think '' -- the curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him -- `` that when I was left an orphan through my mother 's surviving my father only two years , it was you who brought me to England .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 9]: I am almost sure it was you . ''
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 25]: Mr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced to take his , and he put it with some ceremony to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 60]: He then conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again , and , holding the chair-back with his left hand , and using his right by turns to rub his chin , pull his wig at the ears , or point what he said , stood looking down into her face while she sat looking up into his .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 53]: `` Miss Manette , it WAS I. And you will see how truly I spoke of myself just now , in saying I had no feelings , and that all the relations I hold with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations , when you reflect that I have never seen you since .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 28]: No ; you have been the ward of Tellson 's House since , and I have been busy with the other business of Tellson 's House since .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 2]: Feelings !
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 12]: I have no time for them , no chance of them .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 16]: I pass my whole life , miss , in turning an immense pecuniary Mangle . ''
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 48]: After this odd description of his daily routine of employment , Mr. Lorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands -LRB- which was most unnecessary , for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before -RRB- , and resumed his former attitude .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 21]: `` So far , miss -LRB- as you have remarked -RRB- , this is the story of your regretted father .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 5]: Now comes the difference .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 15]: If your father had not died when he did -- Do n't be frightened !
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 5]: How you start ! ''
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 7]: She did , indeed , start .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 10]: And she caught his wrist with both her hands .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 50]: `` Pray , '' said Mr. Lorry , in a soothing tone , bringing his left hand from the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped him in so violent a tremble : `` pray control your agitation -- a matter of business .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 186]: As I was saying -- '' Her look so discomposed him that he stopped , wandered , and began anew : `` As I was saying ; if Monsieur Manette had not died ; if he had suddenly and silently disappeared ; if he had been spirited away ; if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place , though no art could trace him ; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to speak of in a whisper , across the water there ; for instance , the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time ; if his wife had implored the king , the queen , the court , the clergy , for any tidings of him , and all quite in vain ; -- then the history of your father would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman , the Doctor of Beauvais . ''
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 12]: `` I entreat you to tell me more , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 4]: `` I will .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 5]: I am going to .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 6]: You can bear it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 17]: `` I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 11]: `` You speak collectedly , and you -- ARE collected .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 5]: That 's good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 12]: -LRB- Though his manner was less satisfied than his words . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 6]: `` A matter of business .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 12]: Regard it as a matter of business-business that must be done .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 42]: Now if this doctor 's wife , though a lady of great courage and spirit , had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was born -- '' `` The little child was a daughter , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 4]: `` A daughter .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 9]: A-a-matter of business -- do n't be distressed .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 61]: Miss , if the poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born , that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of , by rearing her in the belief that her father was dead -- No , do n't kneel !
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 12]: In Heaven 's name why should you kneel to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 5]: `` For the truth .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 13]: O dear , good , compassionate sir , for the truth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 6]: `` A-a matter of business .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 15]: You confuse me , and how can I transact business if I am confused ?
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 5]: Let us be clear-headed .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 30]: If you could kindly mention now , for instance , what nine times ninepence are , or how many shillings in twenty guineas , it would be so encouraging .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 16]: I should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 50]: Without directly answering to this appeal , she sat so still when he had very gently raised her , and the hands that had not ceased to clasp his wrists were so much more steady than they had been , that she communicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 9]: `` That 's right , that 's right .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 2]: Courage !
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 2]: Business !
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 9]: You have business before you ; useful business .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 11]: Miss Manette , your mother took this course with you .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 69]: And when she died -- I believe broken-hearted -- having never slackened her unavailing search for your father , she left you , at two years old , to grow to be blooming , beautiful , and happy , without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison , or wasted there through many lingering years . ''
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 36]: As he said the words he looked down , with an admiring pity , on the flowing golden hair ; as if he pictured to himself that it might have been already tinged with grey .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 25]: `` You know that your parents had no great possession , and that what they had was secured to your mother and to you .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 30]: There has been no new discovery , of money , or of any other property ; but -- '' He felt his wrist held closer , and he stopped .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 29]: The expression in the forehead , which had so particularly attracted his notice , and which was now immovable , had deepened into one of pain and horror .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 9]: `` But he has been -- been found .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 4]: He is alive .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 23]: Greatly changed , it is too probable ; almost a wreck , it is possible ; though we will hope the best .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 4]: Still , alive .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 47]: Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant in Paris , and we are going there : I , to identify him if I can : you , to restore him to life , love , duty , rest , comfort . ''
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 13]: A shiver ran through her frame , and from it through his .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 31]: She said , in a low , distinct , awe-stricken voice , as if she were saying it in a dream , `` I am going to see his Ghost !
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 10]: It will be his Ghost -- not him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 11]: Mr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 7]: `` There , there , there !
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 6]: See now , see now !
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 12]: The best and the worst are known to you , now .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 36]: You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman , and , with a fair sea voyage , and a fair land journey , you will be soon at his dear side . ''
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 32]: She repeated in the same tone , sunk to a whisper , `` I have been free , I have been happy , yet his Ghost has never haunted me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 42]: `` Only one thing more , '' said Mr. Lorry , laying stress upon it as a wholesome means of enforcing her attention : `` he has been found under another name ; his own , long forgotten or long concealed .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 32]: It would be worse than useless now to inquire which ; worse than useless to seek to know whether he has been for years overlooked , or always designedly held prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 18]: It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries , because it would be dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 29]: Better not to mention the subject , anywhere or in any way , and to remove him -- for a while at all events -- out of France .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 28]: Even I , safe as an Englishman , and even Tellson 's , important as they are to French credit , avoid all naming of the matter .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 15]: I carry about me , not a scrap of writing openly referring to it .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 7]: This is a secret service altogether .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 27]: My credentials , entries , and memoranda , are all comprehended in the one line , ` Recalled to Life ; ' which may mean anything .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 6]: But what is the matter !
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 7]: She does n't notice a word !
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 4]: Miss Manette ! ''
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 49]: Perfectly still and silent , and not even fallen back in her chair , she sat under his hand , utterly insensible ; with her eyes open and fixed upon him , and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or branded into her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 31]: So close was her hold upon his arm , that he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her ; therefore he called out loudly for assistance without moving .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 109]: A wild-looking woman , whom even in his agitation , Mr. Lorry observed to be all of a red colour , and to have red hair , and to be dressed in some extraordinary tight-fitting fashion , and to have on her head a most wonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure , and good measure too , or a great Stilton cheese , came running into the room in advance of the inn servants , and soon settled the question of his detachment from the poor young lady , by laying a brawny hand upon his chest , and sending him flying back against the nearest wall .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 12]: -LRB- `` I really think this must be a man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 16]: was Mr. Lorry 's breathless reflection , simultaneously with his coming against the wall . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 9]: `` Why , look at you all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 9]: bawled this figure , addressing the inn servants .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 18]: `` Why do n't you go and fetch things , instead of standing there staring at me ?
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 12]: I am not so much to look at , am I ?
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 9]: Why do n't you go and fetch things ?
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 25]: I 'll let you know , if you do n't bring smelling-salts , cold water , and vinegar , quick , I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 35]: There was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives , and she softly laid the patient on a sofa , and tended her with great skill and gentleness : calling her `` my precious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 6]: and `` my bird ! ''
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 15]: and spreading her golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 7]: `` And you in brown ! ''
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 28]: she said , indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry ; `` could n't you tell her what you had to tell her , without frightening her to death ?
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 14]: Look at her , with her pretty pale face and her cold hands .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 9]: Do you call THAT being a Banker ? ''
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 84]: Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to answer , that he could only look on , at a distance , with much feebler sympathy and humility , while the strong woman , having banished the inn servants under the mysterious penalty of `` letting them know '' something not mentioned if they stayed there , staring , recovered her charge by a regular series of gradations , and coaxed her to lay her drooping head upon her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 14]: `` I hope she will do well now , '' said Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 12]: `` No thanks to you in brown , if she does .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 5]: My darling pretty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 28]: `` I hope , '' said Mr. Lorry , after another pause of feeble sympathy and humility , `` that you accompany Miss Manette to France ? ''
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 8]: `` A likely thing , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 5]: replied the strong woman .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 28]: `` If it was ever intended that I should go across salt water , do you suppose Providence would have cast my lot in an island ? ''
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 16]: This being another question hard to answer , Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to consider it .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 18]: V The Wine-shop A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken , in the street .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 45]: The accident had happened in getting it out of a cart ; the cask had tumbled out with a run , the hoops had burst , and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop , shattered like a walnut-shell .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 24]: All the people within reach had suspended their business , or their idleness , to run to the spot and drink the wine .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 56]: The rough , irregular stones of the street , pointing every way , and designed , one might have thought , expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them , had dammed it into little pools ; these were surrounded , each by its own jostling group or crowd , according to its size .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 42]: Some men kneeled down , made scoops of their two hands joined , and sipped , or tried to help women , who bent over their shoulders , to sip , before the wine had all run out between their fingers .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 103]: Others , men and women , dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware , or even with handkerchiefs from women 's heads , which were squeezed dry into infants ' mouths ; others made small mud-embankments , to stem the wine as it ran ; others , directed by lookers-on up at high windows , darted here and there , to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions ; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of the cask , licking , and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments with eager relish .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 56]: There was no drainage to carry off the wine , and not only did it all get taken up , but so much mud got taken up along with it , that there might have been a scavenger in the street , if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 29]: A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices -- voices of men , women , and children -- resounded in the street while this wine game lasted .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 12]: There was little roughness in the sport , and much playfulness .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 57]: There was a special companionship in it , an observable inclination on the part of every one to join some other one , which led , especially among the luckier or lighter-hearted , to frolicsome embraces , drinking of healths , shaking of hands , and even joining of hands and dancing , a dozen together .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 35]: When the wine was gone , and the places where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers , these demonstrations ceased , as suddenly as they had broken out .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 110]: The man who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting , set it in motion again ; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of hot ashes , at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own starved fingers and toes , or in those of her child , returned to it ; men with bare arms , matted locks , and cadaverous faces , who had emerged into the winter light from cellars , moved away , to descend again ; and a gloom gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 30]: The wine was red wine , and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the suburb of Saint Antoine , in Paris , where it was spilled .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 22]: It had stained many hands , too , and many faces , and many naked feet , and many wooden shoes .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 44]: The hands of the man who sawed the wood , left red marks on the billets ; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby , was stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 58]: Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask , had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth ; and one tall joker so besmirched , his head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it , scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees -- BLOOD .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 30]: The time was to come , when that wine too would be spilled on the street-stones , and when the stain of it would be red upon many there .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 60]: And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine , which a momentary gleam had driven from his sacred countenance , the darkness of it was heavy-cold , dirt , sickness , ignorance , and want , were the lords in waiting on the saintly presence-nobles of great power all of them ; but , most especially the last .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 59]: Samples of a people that had undergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill , and certainly not in the fabulous mill which ground old people young , shivered at every corner , passed in and out at every doorway , looked from every window , fluttered in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 54]: The mill which had worked them down , was the mill that grinds young people old ; the children had ancient faces and grave voices ; and upon them , and upon the grown faces , and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh , was the sigh , Hunger .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 5]: It was prevalent everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 81]: Hunger was pushed out of the tall houses , in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines ; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and paper ; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the man sawed off ; Hunger stared down from the smokeless chimneys , and started up from the filthy street that had no offal , among its refuse , of anything to eat .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 37]: Hunger was the inscription on the baker 's shelves , written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad bread ; at the sausage-shop , in every dead-dog preparation that was offered for sale .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 37]: Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting chestnuts in the turned cylinder ; Hunger was shred into atomics in every farthing porringer of husky chips of potato , fried with some reluctant drops of oil .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 11]: Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 47]: A narrow winding street , full of offence and stench , with other narrow winding streets diverging , all peopled by rags and nightcaps , and all smelling of rags and nightcaps , and all visible things with a brooding look upon them that looked ill .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 21]: In the hunted air of the people there was yet some wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 43]: Depressed and slinking though they were , eyes of fire were not wanting among them ; nor compressed lips , white with what they suppressed ; nor foreheads knitted into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring , or inflicting .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 23]: The trade signs -LRB- and they were almost as many as the shops -RRB- were , all , grim illustrations of Want .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 24]: The butcher and the porkman painted up , only the leanest scrags of meat ; the baker , the coarsest of meagre loaves .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 27]: The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops , croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer , and were gloweringly confidential together .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 41]: Nothing was represented in a flourishing condition , save tools and weapons ; but , the cutler 's knives and axes were sharp and bright , the smith 's hammers were heavy , and the gunmaker 's stock was murderous .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 29]: The crippling stones of the pavement , with their many little reservoirs of mud and water , had no footways , but broke off abruptly at the doors .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 42]: The kennel , to make amends , ran down the middle of the street -- when it ran at all : which was only after heavy rains , and then it ran , by many eccentric fits , into the houses .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 58]: Across the streets , at wide intervals , one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and pulley ; at night , when the lamplighter had let these down , and lighted , and hoisted them again , a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly manner overhead , as if they were at sea .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 17]: Indeed they were at sea , and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 60]: For , the time was to come , when the gaunt scarecrows of that region should have watched the lamplighter , in their idleness and hunger , so long , as to conceive the idea of improving on his method , and hauling up men by those ropes and pulleys , to flare upon the darkness of their condition .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 39]: But , the time was not come yet ; and every wind that blew over France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain , for the birds , fine of song and feather , took no warning .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 46]: The wine-shop was a corner shop , better than most others in its appearance and degree , and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside it , in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches , looking on at the struggle for the lost wine .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 19]: `` It 's not my affair , '' said he , with a final shrug of the shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 9]: `` The people from the market did it .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 6]: Let them bring another . ''
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 38]: There , his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke , he called to him across the way : `` Say , then , my Gaspard , what do you do there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 19]: The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance , as is often the way with his tribe .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 19]: It missed its mark , and completely failed , as is often the way with his tribe too .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 4]: `` What now ?
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 10]: Are you a subject for the mad hospital ? ''
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 30]: said the wine-shop keeper , crossing the road , and obliterating the jest with a handful of mud , picked up for the purpose , and smeared over it .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 10]: `` Why do you write in the public streets ?
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 19]: Is there -- tell me thou -- is there no other place to write such words in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 21]: In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand -LRB- perhaps accidentally , perhaps not -RRB- upon the joker 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 41]: The joker rapped it with his own , took a nimble spring upward , and came down in a fantastic dancing attitude , with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his hand , and held out .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 20]: A joker of an extremely , not to say wolfishly practical character , he looked , under those circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 14]: `` Put it on , put it on , '' said the other .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 11]: `` Call wine , wine ; and finish there . ''
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 42]: With that advice , he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker 's dress , such as it was -- quite deliberately , as having dirtied the hand on his account ; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 44]: This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked , martial-looking man of thirty , and he should have been of a hot temperament , for , although it was a bitter day , he wore no coat , but carried one slung over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 18]: His shirt-sleeves were rolled up , too , and his brown arms were bare to the elbows .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 17]: Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own crisply-curling short dark hair .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 18]: He was a dark man altogether , with good eyes and a good bold breadth between them .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 50]: Good-humoured looking on the whole , but implacable-looking , too ; evidently a man of a strong resolution and a set purpose ; a man not desirable to be met , rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side , for nothing would turn the man .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 18]: Madame Defarge , his wife , sat in the shop behind the counter as he came in .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 43]: Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age , with a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything , a large hand heavily ringed , a steady face , strong features , and great composure of manner .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 33]: There was a character about Madame Defarge , from which one might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself in any of the reckonings over which she presided .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 34]: Madame Defarge being sensitive to cold , was wrapped in fur , and had a quantity of bright shawl twined about her head , though not to the concealment of her large earrings .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 20]: Her knitting was before her , but she had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 31]: Thus engaged , with her right elbow supported by her left hand , Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in , but coughed just one grain of cough .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 55]: This , in combination with the lifting of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a line , suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the shop among the customers , for any new customer who had dropped in while he stepped over the way .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 28]: The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about , until they rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady , who were seated in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 26]: Other company were there : two playing cards , two playing dominoes , three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply of wine .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 30]: As he passed behind the counter , he took notice that the elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady , `` This is our man . ''
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 13]: `` What the devil do YOU do in that galley there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 14]: said Monsieur Defarge to himself ; `` I do n't know you . ''
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 27]: But , he feigned not to notice the two strangers , and fell into discourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 8]: `` How goes it , Jacques ? ''
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 9]: said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 9]: `` Is all the spilt wine swallowed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 11]: `` Every drop , Jacques , '' answered Monsieur Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 36]: When this interchange of Christian name was effected , Madame Defarge , picking her teeth with her toothpick , coughed another grain of cough , and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 40]: `` It is not often , '' said the second of the three , addressing Monsieur Defarge , `` that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine , or of anything but black bread and death .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 8]: Is it not so , Jacques ? ''
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 12]: `` It is so , Jacques , '' Monsieur Defarge returned .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 37]: At this second interchange of the Christian name , Madame Defarge , still using her toothpick with profound composure , coughed another grain of cough , and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 23]: The last of the three now said his say , as he put down his empty drinking vessel and smacked his lips .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 5]: So much the worse !
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 23]: A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths , and hard lives they live , Jacques .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 7]: Am I right , Jacques ? ''
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 15]: `` You are right , Jacques , '' was the response of Monsieur Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 32]: This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by , kept her eyebrows up , and slightly rustled in her seat .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 4]: `` Hold then !
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 3]: True ! ''
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 4]: muttered her husband .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 7]: `` Gentlemen -- my wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 15]: The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge , with three flourishes .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 16]: She acknowledged their homage by bending her head , and giving them a quick look .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 30]: Then she glanced in a casual manner round the wine-shop , took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose of spirit , and became absorbed in it .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 22]: `` Gentlemen , '' said her husband , who had kept his bright eye observantly upon her , `` good day .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 27]: The chamber , furnished bachelor-fashion , that you wished to see , and were inquiring for when I stepped out , is on the fifth floor .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 31]: The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard close to the left here , '' pointing with his hand , `` near to the window of my establishment .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 21]: But , now that I remember , one of you has already been there , and can show the way .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 5]: Gentlemen , adieu ! ''
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 11]: They paid for their wine , and left the place .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 29]: The eyes of Monsieur Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly gentleman advanced from his corner , and begged the favour of a word .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 19]: `` Willingly , sir , '' said Monsieur Defarge , and quietly stepped with him to the door .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 10]: Their conference was very short , but very decided .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 14]: Almost at the first word , Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 14]: It had not lasted a minute , when he nodded and went out .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 17]: The gentleman then beckoned to the young lady , and they , too , went out .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 14]: Madame Defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows , and saw nothing .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 30]: Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette , emerging from the wine-shop thus , joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own company just before .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 30]: It opened from a stinking little black courtyard , and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses , inhabited by a great number of people .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 34]: In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the gloomy tile-paved staircase , Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee to the child of his old master , and put her hand to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 26]: It was a gentle action , but not at all gently done ; a very remarkable transformation had come over him in a few seconds .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 26]: He had no good-humour in his face , nor any openness of aspect left , but had become a secret , angry , dangerous man .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 12]: `` It is very high ; it is a little difficult .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 6]: Better to begin slowly . ''
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 21]: Thus , Monsieur Defarge , in a stern voice , to Mr. Lorry , as they began ascending the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 6]: `` Is he alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 4]: the latter whispered .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 3]: `` Alone !
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 11]: God help him , who should be with him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 10]: said the other , in the same low voice .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 9]: `` Is he always alone , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 7]: `` Of his own desire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 6]: `` Of his own necessity .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 42]: As he was , when I first saw him after they found me and demanded to know if I would take him , and , at my peril be discreet -- as he was then , so he is now . ''
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 7]: `` He is greatly changed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 4]: `` Changed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 20]: The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand , and mutter a tremendous curse .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 10]: No direct answer could have been half so forcible .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 20]: Mr. Lorry 's spirits grew heavier and heavier , as he and his two companions ascended higher and higher .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 40]: Such a staircase , with its accessories , in the older and more crowded parts of Paris , would be bad enough now ; but , at that time , it was vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 52]: Every little habitation within the great foul nest of one high building -- that is to say , the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general staircase -- left its own heap of refuse on its own landing , besides flinging other refuse from its own windows .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 40]: The uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered , would have polluted the air , even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities ; the two bad sources combined made it almost insupportable .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 19]: Through such an atmosphere , by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison , the way lay .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 30]: Yielding to his own disturbance of mind , and to his young companion 's agitation , which became greater every instant , Mr. Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 37]: Each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating , by which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted , seemed to escape , and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 51]: Through the rusted bars , tastes , rather than glimpses , were caught of the jumbled neighbourhood ; and nothing within range , nearer or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre -- Dame , had any promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 19]: At last , the top of the staircase was gained , and they stopped for the third time .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 27]: There was yet an upper staircase , of a steeper inclination and of contracted dimensions , to be ascended , before the garret story was reached .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 64]: The keeper of the wine-shop , always going a little in advance , and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took , as though he dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady , turned himself about here , and , carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over his shoulder , took out a key .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 11]: `` The door is locked then , my friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 6]: said Mr. Lorry , surprised .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 3]: `` Ay .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 11]: Yes , '' was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 14]: `` You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired ? ''
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 11]: `` I think it necessary to turn the key . ''
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 13]: Monsieur Defarge whispered it closer in his ear , and frowned heavily .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 3]: `` Why !
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 33]: Because he has lived so long , locked up , that he would be frightened-rave-tear himself to pieces-die-come to I know not what harm -- if his door was left open . ''
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 6]: `` Is it possible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 4]: exclaimed Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 6]: `` Is it possible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 5]: repeated Defarge , bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 35]: And a beautiful world we live in , when it IS possible , and when many other such things are possible , and not only possible , but done -- done , see you !
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 9]: -- under that sky there , every day .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 5]: Long live the Devil .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 6]: Let us go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 26]: This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper , that not a word of it had reached the young lady 's ears .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 47]: But , by this time she trembled under such strong emotion , and her face expressed such deep anxiety , and , above all , such dread and terror , that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 6]: `` Courage , dear miss !
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 2]: Courage !
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 2]: Business !
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 22]: The worst will be over in a moment ; it is but passing the room-door , and the worst is over .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 24]: Then , all the good you bring to him , all the relief , all the happiness you bring to him , begin .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 12]: Let our good friend here , assist you on that side .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 7]: That 's well , friend Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 4]: Come , now .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 5]: Business , business ! ''
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 7]: They went up slowly and softly .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 13]: The staircase was short , and they were soon at the top .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 59]: There , as it had an abrupt turn in it , they came all at once in sight of three men , whose heads were bent down close together at the side of a door , and who were intently looking into the room to which the door belonged , through some chinks or holes in the wall .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 32]: On hearing footsteps close at hand , these three turned , and rose , and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the wine-shop .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 16]: `` I forgot them in the surprise of your visit , '' explained Monsieur Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 13]: `` Leave us , good boys ; we have business here . ''
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 10]: The three glided by , and went silently down .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 52]: There appearing to be no other door on that floor , and the keeper of the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone , Mr. Lorry asked him in a whisper , with a little anger : `` Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette ? ''
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 18]: `` I show him , in the way you have seen , to a chosen few . ''
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 6]: `` Is that well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 8]: `` I think it is well . ''
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 6]: `` Who are the few ?
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 7]: How do you choose them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 27]: `` I choose them as real men , of my name -- Jacques is my name -- to whom the sight is likely to do good .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 11]: Enough ; you are English ; that is another thing .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 12]: Stay there , if you please , a little moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 22]: With an admonitory gesture to keep them back , he stooped , and looked in through the crevice in the wall .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 27]: Soon raising his head again , he struck twice or thrice upon the door -- evidently with no other object than to make a noise there .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 35]: With the same intention , he drew the key across it , three or four times , before he put it clumsily into the lock , and turned it as heavily as he could .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 19]: The door slowly opened inward under his hand , and he looked into the room and said something .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 6]: A faint voice answered something .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 14]: Little more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 13]: He looked back over his shoulder , and beckoned them to enter .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 24]: Mr. Lorry got his arm securely round the daughter 's waist , and held her ; for he felt that she was sinking .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 6]: `` A-a-a-business , business ! ''
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 16]: he urged , with a moisture that was not of business shining on his cheek .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 8]: `` Come in , come in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 13]: `` I am afraid of it , '' she answered , shuddering .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 4]: `` Of it ?
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 3]: What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 6]: `` I mean of him .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 5]: Of my father . ''
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 42]: Rendered in a manner desperate , by her state and by the beckoning of their conductor , he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his shoulder , lifted her a little , and hurried her into the room .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 17]: He sat her down just within the door , and held her , clinging to him .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 29]: Defarge drew out the key , closed the door , locked it on the inside , took out the key again , and held it in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 22]: All this he did , methodically , and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he could make .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 17]: Finally , he walked across the room with a measured tread to where the window was .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 8]: He stopped there , and faced round .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 71]: The garret , built to be a depository for firewood and the like , was dim and dark : for , the window of dormer shape , was in truth a door in the roof , with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from the street : unglazed , and closing up the middle in two pieces , like any other door of French construction .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 25]: To exclude the cold , one half of this door was fast closed , and the other was opened but a very little way .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 50]: Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means , that it was difficult , on first coming in , to see anything ; and long habit alone could have slowly formed in any one , the ability to do any work requiring nicety in such obscurity .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 57]: Yet , work of that kind was being done in the garret ; for , with his back towards the door , and his face towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at him , a white-haired man sat on a low bench , stooping forward and very busy , making shoes .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 8]: VI The Shoemaker `` Good day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 17]: said Monsieur Defarge , looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 30]: It was raised for a moment , and a very faint voice responded to the salutation , as if it were at a distance : `` Good day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 12]: `` You are still hard at work , I see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 26]: After a long silence , the head was lifted for another moment , and the voice replied , `` Yes -- I am working . ''
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 21]: This time , a pair of haggard eyes had looked at the questioner , before the face had dropped again .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 10]: The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 22]: It was not the faintness of physical weakness , though confinement and hard fare no doubt had their part in it .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 15]: Its deplorable peculiarity was , that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 16]: It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 32]: So entirely had it lost the life and resonance of the human voice , that it affected the senses like a once beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 15]: So sunken and suppressed it was , that it was like a voice underground .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 42]: So expressive it was , of a hopeless and lost creature , that a famished traveller , wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness , would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 52]: Some minutes of silent work had passed : and the haggard eyes had looked up again : not with any interest or curiosity , but with a dull mechanical perception , beforehand , that the spot where the only visitor they were aware of had stood , was not yet empty .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 28]: `` I want , '' said Defarge , who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker , `` to let in a little more light here .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 8]: You can bear a little more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 43]: The shoemaker stopped his work ; looked with a vacant air of listening , at the floor on one side of him ; then similarly , at the floor on the other side of him ; then , upward at the speaker .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 7]: `` What did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 10]: `` You can bear a little more light ? ''
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 13]: `` I must bear it , if you let it in . ''
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 14]: -LRB- Laying the palest shadow of a stress upon the second word . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 18]: The opened half-door was opened a little further , and secured at that angle for the time .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 27]: A broad ray of light fell into the garret , and showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap , pausing in his labour .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 18]: His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 23]: He had a white beard , raggedly cut , but not very long , a hollow face , and exceedingly bright eyes .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 45]: The hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large , under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair , though they had been really otherwise ; but , they were naturally large , and looked unnaturally so .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 21]: His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat , and showed his body to be withered and worn .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 55]: He , and his old canvas frock , and his loose stockings , and all his poor tatters of clothes , had , in a long seclusion from direct light and air , faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment-yellow , that it would have been hard to say which was which .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 22]: He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light , and the very bones of it seemed transparent .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 15]: So he sat , with a steadfastly vacant gaze , pausing in his work .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 52]: He never looked at the figure before him , without first looking down on this side of himself , then on that , as if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound ; he never spoke , without first wandering in this manner , and forgetting to speak .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 13]: `` Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 11]: asked Defarge , motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 7]: `` What did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 13]: `` Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 10]: `` I ca n't say that I mean to .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 4]: I suppose so .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 6]: I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 17]: But , the question reminded him of his work , and he bent over it again .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 13]: Mr. Lorry came silently forward , leaving the daughter by the door .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 22]: When he had stood , for a minute or two , by the side of Defarge , the shoemaker looked up .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 59]: He showed no surprise at seeing another figure , but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at it -LRB- his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour -RRB- , and then the hand dropped to his work , and he once more bent over the shoe .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 11]: The look and the action had occupied but an instant .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 14]: `` You have a visitor , you see , '' said Monsieur Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 7]: `` What did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 7]: `` Here is a visitor . ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 16]: The shoemaker looked up as before , but without removing a hand from his work .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 4]: `` Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 3]: said Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 15]: `` Here is monsieur , who knows a well-made shoe when he sees one .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 9]: Show him that shoe you are working at .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 6]: Take it , monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 8]: Mr. Lorry took it in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 17]: `` Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is , and the maker 's name . ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 23]: There was a longer pause than usual , before the shoemaker replied : `` I forget what it was you asked me .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 6]: What did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 19]: `` I said , could n't you describe the kind of shoe , for monsieur 's information ? ''
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 8]: `` It is a lady 's shoe .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 8]: It is a young lady 's walking-shoe .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 7]: It is in the present mode .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 6]: I never saw the mode .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 10]: I have had a pattern in my hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 13]: He glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 8]: `` And the maker 's name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 3]: said Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 62]: Now that he had no work to hold , he laid the knuckles of the right hand in the hollow of the left , and then the knuckles of the left hand in the hollow of the right , and then passed a hand across his bearded chin , and so on in regular changes , without a moment 's intermission .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 48]: The task of recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he had spoken , was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon , or endeavouring , in the hope of some disclosure , to stay the spirit of a fast-dying man .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 10]: `` Did you ask me for my name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 6]: `` Assuredly I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 10]: `` One Hundred and Five , North Tower . ''
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 6]: `` Is that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 10]: `` One Hundred and Five , North Tower . ''
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 27]: With a weary sound that was not a sigh , nor a groan , he bent to work again , until the silence was again broken .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 10]: `` You are not a shoemaker by trade ? ''
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 9]: said Mr. Lorry , looking steadfastly at him .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 39]: His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred the question to him : but as no help came from that quarter , they turned back on the questioner when they had sought the ground .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 9]: `` I am not a shoemaker by trade ?
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 10]: No , I was not a shoemaker by trade .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 7]: I -- I learnt it here .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 4]: I taught myself .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 25]: I asked leave to -- '' He lapsed away , even for minutes , ringing those measured changes on his hands the whole time .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 48]: His eyes came slowly back , at last , to the face from which they had wandered ; when they rested on it , he started , and resumed , in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake , reverting to a subject of last night .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 29]: `` I asked leave to teach myself , and I got it with much difficulty after a long while , and I have made shoes ever since . ''
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 39]: As he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him , Mr. Lorry said , still looking steadfastly in his face : `` Monsieur Manette , do you remember nothing of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 16]: The shoe dropped to the ground , and he sat looking fixedly at the questioner .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 24]: `` Monsieur Manette '' ; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge 's arm ; `` do you remember nothing of this man ?
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 4]: Look at him .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 4]: Look at me .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 27]: Is there no old banker , no old business , no old servant , no old time , rising in your mind , Monsieur Manette ? ''
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 49]: As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly , by turns , at Mr. Lorry and at Defarge , some long obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead , gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 19]: They were overclouded again , they were fainter , they were gone ; but they had been there .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 133]: And so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him , and where she now stood looking at him , with hands which at first had been only raised in frightened compassion , if not even to keep him off and shut out the sight of him , but which were now extending towards him , trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young breast , and love it back to life and hope -- so exactly was the expression repeated -LRB- though in stronger characters -RRB- on her fair young face , that it looked as though it had passed like a moving light , from him to her .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 9]: Darkness had fallen on him in its place .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 29]: He looked at the two , less and less attentively , and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him in the old way .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 19]: Finally , with a deep long sigh , he took the shoe up , and resumed his work .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 9]: `` Have you recognised him , monsieur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 6]: asked Defarge in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 7]: `` Yes ; for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 28]: At first I thought it quite hopeless , but I have unquestionably seen , for a single moment , the face that I once knew so well .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 6]: Let us draw further back .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 3]: Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 20]: She had moved from the wall of the garret , very near to the bench on which he sat .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 27]: There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped over his labour .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 12]: Not a word was spoken , not a sound was made .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 17]: She stood , like a spirit , beside him , and he bent over his work .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 24]: It happened , at length , that he had occasion to change the instrument in his hand , for his shoemaker 's knife .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 17]: It lay on that side of him which was not the side on which she stood .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 23]: He had taken it up , and was stooping to work again , when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 9]: He raised them , and saw her face .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 17]: The two spectators started forward , but she stayed them with a motion of her hand .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 17]: She had no fear of his striking at her with the knife , though they had .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 28]: He stared at her with a fearful look , and after a while his lips began to form some words , though no sound proceeded from them .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 25]: By degrees , in the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing , he was heard to say : `` What is this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 39]: With the tears streaming down her face , she put her two hands to her lips , and kissed them to him ; then clasped them on her breast , as if she laid his ruined head there .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 10]: `` You are not the gaoler 's daughter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 6]: She sighed `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 6]: `` Who are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 18]: Not yet trusting the tones of her voice , she sat down on the bench beside him .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 12]: He recoiled , but she laid her hand upon his arm .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 32]: A strange thrill struck him when she did so , and visibly passed over his frame ; he laid the knife down ' softly , as he sat staring at her .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 24]: Her golden hair , which she wore in long curls , had been hurriedly pushed aside , and fell down over her neck .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 17]: Advancing his hand by little and little , he took it up and looked at it .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 24]: In the midst of the action he went astray , and , with another deep sigh , fell to work at his shoemaking .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 5]: But not for long .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 12]: Releasing his arm , she laid her hand upon his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 51]: After looking doubtfully at it , two or three times , as if to be sure that it was really there , he laid down his work , put his hand to his neck , and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag attached to it .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 45]: He opened this , carefully , on his knee , and it contained a very little quantity of hair : not more than one or two long golden hairs , which he had , in some old day , wound off upon his finger .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 15]: He took her hair into his hand again , and looked closely at it .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 6]: `` It is the same .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 5]: How can it be !
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 4]: When was it !
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 5]: How was it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 21]: As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead , he seemed to become conscious that it was in hers too .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 13]: He turned her full to the light , and looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 47]: `` She had laid her head upon my shoulder , that night when I was summoned out -- she had a fear of my going , though I had none -- and when I was brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 7]: ` You will leave me them ?
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 19]: They can never help me to escape in the body , though they may in the spirit . '
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 7]: Those were the words I said .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 7]: I remember them very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 15]: He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 19]: But when he did find spoken words for it , they came to him coherently , though slowly .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 5]: `` How was this ?
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 6]: -- WAS IT YOU ? ''
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 18]: Once more , the two spectators started , as he turned upon her with a frightful suddenness .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 41]: But she sat perfectly still in his grasp , and only said , in a low voice , `` I entreat you , good gentlemen , do not come near us , do not speak , do not move ! ''
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 4]: `` Hark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 7]: `` Whose voice was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 25]: His hands released her as he uttered this cry , and went up to his white hair , which they tore in a frenzy .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 43]: It died out , as everything but his shoemaking did die out of him , and he refolded his little packet and tried to secure it in his breast ; but he still looked at her , and gloomily shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 15]: `` No , no , no ; you are too young , too blooming .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 5]: It ca n't be .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 6]: See what the prisoner is .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 25]: These are not the hands she knew , this is not the face she knew , this is not a voice she ever heard .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 4]: No , no .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 19]: She was -- and He was -- before the slow years of the North Tower -- ages ago .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 10]: What is your name , my gentle angel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 24]: Hailing his softened tone and manner , his daughter fell upon her knees before him , with her appealing hands upon his breast .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 36]: `` O , sir , at another time you shall know my name , and who my mother was , and who my father , and how I never knew their hard , hard history .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 18]: But I can not tell you at this time , and I can not tell you here .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 26]: All that I may tell you , here and now , is , that I pray to you to touch me and to bless me .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 6]: Kiss me , kiss me !
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 8]: O my dear , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 27]: His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair , which warmed and lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 51]: `` If you hear in my voice -- I do n't know that it is so , but I hope it is -- if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears , weep for it , weep for it !
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 35]: If you touch , in touching my hair , anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your breast when you were young and free , weep for it , weep for it !
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 60]: If , when I hint to you of a Home that is before us , where I will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful service , I bring back the remembrance of a Home long desolate , while your poor heart pined away , weep for it , weep for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 18]: She held him closer round the neck , and rocked him on her breast like a child .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 73]: `` If , when I tell you , dearest dear , that your agony is over , and that I have come here to take you from it , and that we go to England to be at peace and at rest , I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste , and of our native France so wicked to you , weep for it , weep for it !
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 82]: And if , when I shall tell you of my name , and of my father who is living , and of my mother who is dead , you learn that I have to kneel to my honoured father , and implore his pardon for having never for his sake striven all day and lain awake and wept all night , because the love of my poor mother hid his torture from me , weep for it , weep for it !
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 10]: Weep for her , then , and for me !
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 6]: Good gentlemen , thank God !
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 17]: I feel his sacred tears upon my face , and his sobs strike against my heart .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 4]: O , see !
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 9]: Thank God for us , thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 43]: He had sunk in her arms , and his face dropped on her breast : a sight so touching , yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which had gone before it , that the two beholders covered their faces .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 63]: When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed , and his heaving breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all storms -- emblem to humanity , of the rest and silence into which the storm called Life must hush at last -- they came forward to raise the father and daughter from the ground .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 18]: He had gradually dropped to the floor , and lay there in a lethargy , worn out .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 28]: She had nestled down with him , that his head might lie upon her arm ; and her hair drooping over him curtained him from the light .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 63]: `` If , without disturbing him , '' she said , raising her hand to Mr. Lorry as he stooped over them , after repeated blowings of his nose , `` all could be arranged for our leaving Paris at once , so that , from the , very door , he could be taken away -- '' `` But , consider .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 8]: Is he fit for the journey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 4]: asked Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 22]: `` More fit for that , I think , than to remain in this city , so dreadful to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 18]: `` It is true , '' said Defarge , who was kneeling to look on and hear .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 18]: `` More than that ; Monsieur Manette is , for all reasons , best out of France .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 11]: Say , shall I hire a carriage and post-horses ? ''
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 35]: `` That 's business , '' said Mr. Lorry , resuming on the shortest notice his methodical manners ; `` and if business is to be done , I had better do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 18]: `` Then be so kind , '' urged Miss Manette , `` as to leave us here .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 21]: You see how composed he has become , and you can not be afraid to leave him with me now .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 5]: Why should you be ?
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 34]: If you will lock the door to secure us from interruption , I do not doubt that you will find him , when you come back , as quiet as you leave him .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 23]: In any case , I will take care of him until you return , and then we will remove him straight . ''
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 21]: Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course , and in favour of one of them remaining .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 57]: But , as there were not only carriage and horses to be seen to , but travelling papers ; and as time pressed , for the day was drawing to an end , it came at last to their hastily dividing the business that was necessary to be done , and hurrying away to do it .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 29]: Then , as the darkness closed in , the daughter laid her head down on the hard ground close at the father 's side , and watched him .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 23]: The darkness deepened and deepened , and they both lay quiet , until a light gleamed through the chinks in the wall .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 35]: Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey , and had brought with them , besides travelling cloaks and wrappers , bread and meat , wine , and hot coffee .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 47]: Monsieur Defarge put this provender , and the lamp he carried , on the shoemaker 's bench -LRB- there was nothing else in the garret but a pallet bed -RRB- , and he and Mr. Lorry roused the captive , and assisted him to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 21]: No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind , in the scared blank wonder of his face .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 34]: Whether he knew what had happened , whether he recollected what they had said to him , whether he knew that he was free , were questions which no sagacity could have solved .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 40]: They tried speaking to him ; but , he was so confused , and so very slow to answer , that they took fright at his bewilderment , and agreed for the time to tamper with him no more .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 50]: He had a wild , lost manner of occasionally clasping his head in his hands , that had not been seen in him before ; yet , he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his daughter 's voice , and invariably turned to it when she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 42]: In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion , he ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink , and put on the cloak and other wrappings , that they gave him to wear .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 26]: He readily responded to his daughter 's drawing her arm through his , and took -- and kept -- her hand in both his own .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 20]: They began to descend ; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp , Mr. Lorry closing the little procession .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 26]: They had not traversed many steps of the long main staircase when he stopped , and stared at the roof and round at the wails .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 9]: `` You remember the place , my father ?
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 7]: You remember coming up here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 7]: `` What did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 20]: But , before she could repeat the question , he murmured an answer as if she had repeated it .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 3]: `` Remember ?
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 7]: No , I do n't remember .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 8]: It was so very long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 23]: That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his prison to that house , was apparent to them .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 35]: They heard him mutter , `` One Hundred and Five , North Tower ; '' and when he looked about him , it evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed him .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 49]: On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his tread , as being in expectation of a drawbridge ; and when there was no drawbridge , and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street , he dropped his daughter 's hand and clasped his head again .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 28]: No crowd was about the door ; no people were discernible at any of the many windows ; not even a chance passerby was in the street .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 8]: An unnatural silence and desertion reigned there .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 26]: Only one soul was to be seen , and that was Madame Defarge -- who leaned against the door-post , knitting , and saw nothing .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 40]: The prisoner had got into a coach , and his daughter had followed him , when Mr. Lorry 's feet were arrested on the step by his asking , miserably , for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 27]: Madame Defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them , and went , knitting , out of the lamplight , through the courtyard .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 25]: She quickly brought them down and handed them in ; -- and immediately afterwards leaned against the door-post , knitting , and saw nothing .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 16]: Defarge got upon the box , and gave the word `` To the Barrier ! ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 16]: The postilion cracked his whip , and they clattered away under the feeble over-swinging lamps .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 41]: Under the over-swinging lamps -- swinging ever brighter in the better streets , and ever dimmer in the worse -- and by lighted shops , gay crowds , illuminated coffee-houses , and theatre-doors , to one of the city gates .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 9]: Soldiers with lanterns , at the guard-house there .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 7]: `` Your papers , travellers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 36]: `` See here then , Monsieur the Officer , '' said Defarge , getting down , and taking him gravely apart , `` these are the papers of monsieur inside , with the white head .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 67]: They were consigned to me , with him , at the -- '' He dropped his voice , there was a flutter among the military lanterns , and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm in uniform , the eyes connected with the arm looked , not an every day or an every night look , at monsieur with the white head .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 5]: `` It is well .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 3]: Forward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 4]: from the uniform .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 4]: `` Adieu ! ''
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 3]: from Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 22]: And so , under a short grove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps , out under the great grove of stars .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 56]: Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights ; some , so remote from this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their rays have even yet discovered it , as a point in space where anything is suffered or done : the shadows of the night were broad and black .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 69]: All through the cold and restless interval , until dawn , they once more whispered in the ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorry -- sitting opposite the buried man who had been dug out , and wondering what subtle powers were for ever lost to him , and what were capable of restoration -- the old inquiry : `` I hope you care to be recalled to life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 12]: And the old answer : `` I ca n't say . ''
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 7]: The end of the first book .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 33]: Book the Second -- the Golden Thread I Five Years Later Tellson 's Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place , even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 14]: It was very small , very dark , very ugly , very incommodious .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 39]: It was an old-fashioned place , moreover , in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were proud of its smallness , proud of its darkness , proud of its ugliness , proud of its incommodiousness .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 32]: They were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars , and were fired by an express conviction that , if it were less objectionable , it would be less respectable .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 20]: This was no passive belief , but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 22]: Tellson 's -LRB- they said -RRB- wanted no elbow-room , Tellson 's wanted no light , Tellson 's wanted no embellishment .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 20]: Noakes and Co. ` s might , or Snooks Brothers ' might ; but Tellson 's , thank Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 19]: -- Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the question of rebuilding Tellson 's .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 42]: In this respect the House was much on a par with the Country ; which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable , but were only the more respectable .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 17]: Thus it had come to pass , that Tellson 's was the triumphant perfection of inconvenience .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 100]: After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with a weak rattle in its throat , you fell into Tellson 's down two steps , and came to your senses in a miserable little shop , with two little counters , where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the wind rustled it , while they examined the signature by the dingiest of windows , which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street , and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper , and the heavy shadow of Temple Bar .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 55]: If your business necessitated your seeing `` the House , '' you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back , where you meditated on a misspent life , until the House came with its hands in its pockets , and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal twilight .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 33]: Your money came out of , or went into , wormy old wooden drawers , particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when they were opened and shut .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 17]: Your bank-notes had a musty odour , as if they were fast decomposing into rags again .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 23]: Your plate was stowed away among the neighbouring cesspools , and evil communications corrupted its good polish in a day or two .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 26]: Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms made of kitchens and sculleries , and fretted all the fat out of their parchments into the banking-house air .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 91]: Your lighter boxes of family papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room , that always had a great dining-table in it and never had a dinner , and where , even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty , the first letters written to you by your old love , or by your little children , were but newly released from the horror of being ogled through the windows , by the heads exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of Abyssinia or Ashantee .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 31]: But indeed , at that time , putting to death was a recipe much in vogue with all trades and professions , and not least of all with Tellson 's .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 15]: Death is Nature 's remedy for all things , and why not Legislation 's ?
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 94]: Accordingly , the forger was put to Death ; the utterer of a bad note was put to Death ; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death ; the purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death ; the holder of a horse at Tellson 's door , who made off with it , was put to Death ; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death ; the sounders of three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime , were put to Death .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 58]: Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention -- it might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the reverse -- but , it cleared off -LRB- as to this world -RRB- the trouble of each particular case , and left nothing else connected with it to be looked after .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 65]: Thus , Tellson 's , in its day , like greater places of business , its contemporaries , had taken so many lives , that , if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately disposed of , they would probably have excluded what little light the ground floor had , in a rather significant manner .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 23]: Cramped in all kinds of dun cupboards and hutches at Tellson 's , the oldest of men carried on the business gravely .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 21]: When they took a young man into Tellson 's London house , they hid him somewhere till he was old .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 24]: They kept him in a dark place , like a cheese , until he had the full Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 29]: Then only was he permitted to be seen , spectacularly poring over large books , and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 35]: Outside Tellson 's -- never by any means in it , unless called in -- was an odd-job-man , an occasional porter and messenger , who served as the live sign of the house .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 34]: He was never absent during business hours , unless upon an errand , and then he was represented by his son : a grisly urchin of twelve , who was his express image .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 15]: People understood that Tellson 's , in a stately way , tolerated the odd-job-man .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 23]: The house had always tolerated some person in that capacity , and time and tide had drifted this person to the post .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 37]: His surname was Cruncher , and on the youthful occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness , in the easterly parish church of Hounsditch , he had received the added appellation of Jerry .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 34]: The scene was Mr. Cruncher 's private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley , Whitefriars : the time , half-past seven of the clock on a windy March morning , Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 45]: -LRB- Mr. Cruncher himself always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes : apparently under the impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a popular game , by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 36]: Mr. Cruncher 's apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood , and were but two in number , even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it might be counted as one .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 7]: But they were very decently kept .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 47]: Early as it was , on the windy March morning , the room in which he lay abed was already scrubbed throughout ; and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast , and the lumbering deal table , a very clean white cloth was spread .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 14]: Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane , like a Harlequin at home .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 42]: At fast , he slept heavily , but , by degrees , began to roll and surge in bed , until he rose above the surface , with his spiky hair looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 27]: At which juncture , he exclaimed , in a voice of dire exasperation : `` Bust me , if she ai n't at it agin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 30]: A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a corner , with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the person referred to .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 12]: said Mr. Cruncher , looking out of bed for a boot .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 11]: `` You 're at it agin , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 20]: After hailing the mom with this second salutation , he threw a boot at the woman as a third .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 50]: It was a very muddy boot , and may introduce the odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher 's domestic economy , that , whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots , he often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 26]: `` What , '' said Mr. Cruncher , varying his apostrophe after missing his mark -- `` what are you up to , Aggerawayter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 9]: `` I was only saying my prayers . ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 5]: `` Saying your prayers !
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 6]: You 're a nice woman !
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 14]: What do you mean by flopping yourself down and praying agin me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 15]: `` I was not praying against you ; I was praying for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 5]: `` You were n't .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 14]: And if you were , I wo n't be took the liberty with .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 2]: Here !
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 19]: your mother 's a nice woman , young Jerry , going a praying agin your father 's prosperity .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 13]: You 've got a dutiful mother , you have , my son .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 37]: You 've got a religious mother , you have , my boy : going and flopping herself down , and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched out of the mouth of her only child . ''
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 31]: Master Cruncher -LRB- who was in his shirt -RRB- took this very ill , and , turning to his mother , strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal board .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 30]: `` And what do you suppose , you conceited female , '' said Mr. Cruncher , with unconscious inconsistency , `` that the worth of YOUR prayers may be ?
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 11]: Name the price that you put YOUR prayers at ! ''
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 10]: `` They only come from the heart , Jerry .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 9]: They are worth no more than that . ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 12]: `` Worth no more than that , '' repeated Mr. Cruncher .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 9]: `` They ai n't worth much , then .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 15]: Whether or no , I wo n't be prayed agin , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 6]: I ca n't afford it .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 13]: I 'm not a going to be made unlucky by YOUR sneaking .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 24]: If you must go flopping yourself down , flop in favour of your husband and child , and not in opposition to 'em .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 49]: If I had had any but a unnat ` ral wife , and this poor boy had had any but a unnat ` ral mother , I might have made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 4]: B-u-u-ust me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 52]: said Mr. Cruncher , who all this time had been putting on his clothes , `` if I ai n't , what with piety and one blowed thing and another , been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor devil of a honest tradesman met with !
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 40]: Young Jerry , dress yourself , my boy , and while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and then , and if you see any signs of more flopping , give me a call .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 27]: For , I tell you , '' here he addressed his wife once more , `` I wo n't be gone agin , in this manner .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 103]: I am as rickety as a hackney-coach , I 'm as sleepy as laudanum , my lines is strained to that degree that I should n't know , if it was n't for the pain in 'em , which was me and which somebody else , yet I 'm none the better for it in pocket ; and it 's my suspicion that you 've been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for it in pocket , and I wo n't put up with it , Aggerawayter , and what do you say now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 11]: Growling , in addition , such phrases as `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 2]: yes !
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 6]: You 're religious , too .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 19]: You would n't put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband and child , would you ?
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 4]: Not you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 28]: and throwing off other sarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his indignation , Mr. Cruncher betook himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 39]: In the meantime , his son , whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes , and whose young eyes stood close by one another , as his father 's did , kept the required watch upon his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 37]: He greatly disturbed that poor woman at intervals , by darting out of his sleeping closet , where he made his toilet , with a suppressed cry of `` You are going to flop , mother .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 6]: -- Halloa , father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 16]: and , after raising this fictitious alarm , darting in again with an undutiful grin .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 16]: Mr. Cruncher 's temper was not at all improved when he came to his breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 11]: He resented Mrs. Cruncher 's saying grace with particular animosity .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 5]: `` Now , Aggerawayter !
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 6]: What are you up to ?
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 5]: At it again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 13]: His wife explained that she had merely `` asked a blessing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 7]: `` Do n't do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 25]: said Mr. Crunches looking about , as if he rather expected to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife 's petitions .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 15]: `` I ai n't a going to be blest out of house and home .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 11]: I wo n't have my wittles blest off my table .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 4]: Keep still ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 46]: Exceedingly red-eyed and grim , as if he had been up all night at a party which had taken anything but a convivial turn , Jerry Cruncher worried his breakfast rather than ate it , growling over it like any four-footed inmate of a menagerie .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 36]: Towards nine o'clock he smoothed his ruffled aspect , and , presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as he could overlay his natural self with , issued forth to the occupation of the day .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 23]: It could scarcely be called a trade , in spite of his favourite description of himself as `` a honest tradesman . ''
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 83]: His stock consisted of a wooden stool , made out of a broken-backed chair cut down , which stool , young Jerry , walking at his father 's side , carried every morning to beneath the banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar : where , with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man 's feet , it formed the encampment for the day .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 30]: On this post of his , Mr. Cruncher was as well known to Fleet-street and the Temple , as the Bar itself , -- and was almost as in-looking .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 78]: Encamped at a quarter before nine , in good time to touch his three-cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellson 's , Jerry took up his station on this windy March morning , with young Jerry standing by him , when not engaged in making forays through the Bar , to inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 46]: Father and son , extremely like each other , looking silently on at the morning traffic in Fleet-street , with their two heads as near to one another as the two eyes of each were , bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 41]: The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance , that the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw , while the twinkling eyes of the youthful Jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else in Fleet-street .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 31]: The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson 's establishment was put through the door , and the word was given : `` Porter wanted ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 5]: `` Hooray , father !
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 10]: Here 's an early job to begin with ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 33]: Having thus given his parent God speed , young Jerry seated himself on the stool , entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father had been chewing , and cogitated .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 4]: `` Al-ways rusty !
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 7]: His fingers is al-ways rusty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 4]: muttered young Jerry .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 12]: `` Where does my father get all that iron rust from ?
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 10]: He do n't get no iron rust here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 16]: II A Sight `` You know the Old Bailey , well , no doubt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 12]: said one of the oldest of clerks to Jerry the messenger .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 16]: `` Ye-es , sir , '' returned Jerry , in something of a dogged manner .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 8]: `` I DO know the Bailey . ''
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 4]: `` Just so .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 7]: And you know Mr. Lorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 16]: `` I know Mr. Lorry , sir , much better than I know the Bailey .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 34]: Much better , '' said Jerry , not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment in question , `` than I , as a honest tradesman , wish to know the Bailey . ''
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 19]: Find the door where the witnesses go in , and show the door-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 8]: He will then let you in . ''
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 8]: `` Into the court , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 6]: `` Into the court . ''
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 29]: Mr. Cruncher 's eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another , and to interchange the inquiry , `` What do you think of this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 12]: `` Am I to wait in the court , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 10]: he asked , as the result of that conference .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 8]: `` I am going to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 31]: The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr. Lorry , and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry 's attention , and show him where you stand .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 18]: Then what you have to do , is , to remain there until he wants you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 8]: `` Is that all , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 5]: `` That 's all .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 9]: He wishes to have a messenger at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 10]: This is to tell him you are there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 41]: As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note , Mr. Cruncher , after surveying him in silence until he came to the blotting-paper stage , remarked : `` I suppose they 'll be trying Forgeries this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 4]: `` Treason ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 9]: `` That 's quartering , '' said Jerry .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 4]: `` Barbarous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 19]: `` It is the law , '' remarked the ancient clerk , turning his surprised spectacles upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 7]: `` It is the law . ''
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 15]: `` It 's hard in the law to spile a man , I think .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 19]: Ifs hard enough to kill him , but it 's wery hard to spile him , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 11]: `` Not at all , '' retained the ancient clerk .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 7]: `` Speak well of the law .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 22]: Take care of your chest and voice , my good friend , and leave the law to take care of itself .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 7]: I give you that advice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 20]: `` It 's the damp , sir , what settles on my chest and voice , '' said Jerry .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 18]: `` I leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 23]: `` Well , well , '' said the old clerk ; `` we all have our various ways of gaining a livelihood .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 15]: Some of us have damp ways , and some of us have dry ways .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 5]: Here is the letter .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 4]: Go along . ''
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 53]: Jerry took the letter , and , remarking to himself with less internal deference than he made an outward show of , `` You are a lean old one , too , '' made his bow , informed his son , in passing , of his destination , and went his way .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 27]: They hanged at Tyburn , in those days , so the street outside Newgate had not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 56]: But , the gaol was a vile place , in which most kinds of debauchery and villainy were practised , and where dire diseases were bred , that came into court with the prisoners , and sometimes rushed straight from the dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself , and pulled him off the bench .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 31]: It had more than once happened , that the Judge in the black cap pronounced his own doom as certainly as the prisoner 's , and even died before him .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 60]: For the rest , the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard , from which pale travellers set out continually , in carts and coaches , on a violent passage into the other world : traversing some two miles and a half of public street and road , and shaming few good citizens , if any .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 16]: So powerful is use , and so desirable to be good use in the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 77]: It was famous , too , for the pillory , a wise old institution , that inflicted a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent ; also , for the whipping-post , another dear old institution , very humanising and softening to behold in action ; also , for extensive transactions in blood-money , another fragment of ancestral wisdom , systematically leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed under Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 55]: Altogether , the Old Bailey , at that date , was a choice illustration of the precept , that `` Whatever is is right ; '' an aphorism that would be as final as it is lazy , did it not include the troublesome consequence , that nothing that ever was , was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 51]: Making his way through the tainted crowd , dispersed up and down this hideous scene of action , with the skill of a man accustomed to make his way quietly , the messenger found out the door he sought , and handed in his letter through a trap in it .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 34]: For , people then paid to see the play at the Old Bailey , just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam -- only the former entertainment was much the dearer .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 33]: Therefore , all the Old Bailey doors were well guarded -- except , indeed , the social doors by which the criminals got there , and those were always left wide open .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 29]: After some delay and demur , the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a very little way , and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into court .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 6]: `` What 's on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 16]: he asked , in a whisper , of the man he found himself next to .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 5]: `` Nothing yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 7]: `` What 's coming on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 6]: `` The Treason case . ''
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 8]: `` The quartering one , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 67]: returned the man , with a relish ; `` he 'll be drawn on a hurdle to be half hanged , and then he 'll be taken down and sliced before his own face , and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on , and then his head will be chopped off , and he 'll be cut into quarters .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 6]: That 's the sentence . ''
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 13]: `` If he 's found Guilty , you mean to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 8]: Jerry added , by way of proviso .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 11]: they 'll find him guilty , '' said the other .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 10]: `` Do n't you be afraid of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 28]: Mr. Cruncher 's attention was here diverted to the door-keeper , whom he saw making his way to Mr. Lorry , with the note in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 73]: Mr. Lorry sat at a table , among the gentlemen in wigs : not far from a wigged gentleman , the prisoner 's counsel , who had a great bundle of papers before him : and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands in his pockets , whose whole attention , when Mr. Cruncher looked at him then or afterwards , seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the court .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 41]: After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing with his hand , Jerry attracted the notice of Mr. Lorry , who had stood up to look for him , and who quietly nodded and sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 12]: `` What 's HE got to do with the case ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 8]: asked the man he had spoken with .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 10]: `` Blest if I know , '' said Jerry .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 19]: `` What have YOU got to do with it , then , if a person may inquire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 12]: `` Blest if I know that either , '' said Jerry .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 22]: The entrance of the Judge , and a consequent great stir and settling down in the court , stopped the dialogue .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 11]: Presently , the dock became the central point of interest .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 25]: Two gaolers , who had been standing there , wont out , and the prisoner was brought in , and put to the bar .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 18]: Everybody present , except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the ceiling , stared at him .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 24]: All the human breath in the place , rolled at him , like a sea , or a wind , or a fire .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 85]: Eager faces strained round pillars and corners , to get a sight of him ; spectators in back rows stood up , not to miss a hair of him ; people on the floor of the court , laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them , to help themselves , at anybody 's cost , to a view of him -- stood a-tiptoe , got upon ledges , stood upon next to nothing , to see every inch of him .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 83]: Conspicuous among these latter , like an animated bit of the spiked wall of Newgate , Jerry stood : aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a whet he had taken as he came along , and discharging it to mingle with the waves of other beer , and gin , and tea , and coffee , and what not , that flowed at him , and already broke upon the great windows behind him in an impure mist and rain .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 30]: The object of all this staring and blaring , was a young man of about five-and-twenty , well-grown and well-looking , with a sunburnt cheek and a dark eye .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 9]: His condition was that of a young gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 45]: He was plainly dressed in black , or very dark grey , and his hair , which was long and dark , was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck ; more to be out of his way than for ornament .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 41]: As an emotion of the mind will express itself through any covering of the body , so the paleness which his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek , showing the soul to be stronger than the sun .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 15]: He was otherwise quite self-possessed , bowed to the Judge , and stood quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 22]: The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at , was not a sort that elevated humanity .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 38]: Had he stood in peril of a less horrible sentence -- had there been a chance of any one of its savage details being spared -- by just so much would he have lost in his fascination .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 34]: The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled , was the sight ; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered and torn asunder , yielded the sensation .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 32]: Whatever gloss the various spectators put upon the interest , according to their several arts and powers of self-deceit , the interest was , at the root of it , Ogreish .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 5]: Silence in the court !
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 161]: Charles Darnay had yesterday pleaded Not Guilty to an indictment denouncing him -LRB- with infinite jingle and jangle -RRB- for that he was a false traitor to our serene , illustrious , excellent , and so forth , prince , our Lord the King , by reason of his having , on divers occasions , and by divers means and ways , assisted Lewis , the French King , in his wars against our said serene , illustrious , excellent , and so forth ; that was to say , by coming and going , between the dominions of our said serene , illustrious , excellent , and so forth , and those of the said French Lewis , and wickedly , falsely , traitorously , and otherwise evil-adverbiously , revealing to the said French Lewis what forces our said serene , illustrious , excellent , and so forth , had in preparation to send to Canada and North America .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 74]: This much , Jerry , with his head becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it , made out with huge satisfaction , and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that the aforesaid , and over and over again aforesaid , Charles Darnay , stood there before him upon his trial ; that the jury were swearing in ; and that Mr. Attorney -- General was making ready to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 39]: The accused , who was -LRB- and who knew he was -RRB- being mentally hanged , beheaded , and quartered , by everybody there , neither flinched from the situation , nor assumed any theatrical air in it .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 48]: He was quiet and attentive ; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest ; and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him , so composedly , that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which it was strewn .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 22]: The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with vinegar , as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 18]: Over the prisoner 's head there was a mirror , to throw the light down upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 25]: Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in it , and had passed from its surface and this earth 's together .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 36]: Haunted in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been , if the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections , as the ocean is one day to give up its dead .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 23]: Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace for which it had been reserved , may have struck the prisoner 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 46]: Be that as it may , a change in his position making him conscious of a bar of light across his face , he looked up ; and when he saw the glass his face flushed , and his right hand pushed the herbs away .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 21]: It happened , that the action turned his face to that side of the court which was on his left .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 56]: About on a level with his eyes , there sat , in that corner of the Judge 's bench , two persons upon whom his look immediately rested ; so immediately , and so much to the changing of his aspect , that all the eyes that were tamed upon him , turned to them .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 62]: The spectators saw in the two figures , a young lady of little more than twenty , and a gentleman who was evidently her father ; a man of a very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair , and a certain indescribable intensity of face : not of an active kind , but pondering and self-communing .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 53]: When this expression was upon him , he looked as if he were old ; but when it was stirred and broken up -- as it was now , in a moment , on his speaking to his daughter -- he became a handsome man , not past the prime of life .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 25]: His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm , as she sat by him , and the other pressed upon it .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 22]: She had drawn close to him , in her dread of the scene , and in her pity for the prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 22]: Her forehead had been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion that saw nothing but the peril of the accused .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 40]: This had been so very noticeable , so very powerfully and naturally shown , that starers who had had no pity for him were touched by her ; and the whisper went about , `` Who are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 40]: Jerry , the messenger , who had made his own observations , in his own manner , and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his absorption , stretched his neck to hear who they were .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 40]: The crowd about him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant , and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back ; at last it got to Jerry : `` Witnesses . ''
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 6]: `` For which side ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 4]: `` Against . ''
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 6]: `` Against what side ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 6]: `` The prisoner 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 57]: The Judge , whose eyes had gone in the general direction , recalled them , leaned back in his seat , and looked steadily at the man whose life was in his hand , as Mr. Attorney -- General rose to spin the rope , grind the axe , and hammer the nails into the scaffold .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 38]: III A Disappointment Mr. Attorney -- General had to inform the jury , that the prisoner before them , though young in years , was old in the treasonable practices which claimed the forfeit of his life .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 30]: That this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day , or of yesterday , or even of last year , or of the year before .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 39]: That , it was certain the prisoner had , for longer than that , been in the habit of passing and repassing between France and England , on secret business of which he could give no honest account .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 34]: That , if it were in the nature of traitorous ways to thrive -LRB- which happily it never was -RRB- , the real wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 56]: That Providence , however , had put it into the heart of a person who was beyond fear and beyond reproach , to ferret out the nature of the prisoner 's schemes , and , struck with horror , to disclose them to his Majesty 's Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 10]: That , this patriot would be produced before them .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 14]: That , his position and attitude were , on the whole , sublime .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 48]: That , he had been the prisoner 's friend , but , at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his infamy , had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish in his bosom , on the sacred altar of his country .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 29]: That , if statues were decreed in Britain , as in ancient Greece and Rome , to public benefactors , this shining citizen would assuredly have had one .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 16]: That , as they were not so decreed , he probably would not have one .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 73]: That , Virtue , as had been observed by the poets -LRB- in many passages which he well knew the jury would have , word for word , at the tips of their tongues ; whereat the jury 's countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that they knew nothing about the passages -RRB- , was in a manner contagious ; more especially the bright virtue known as patriotism , or love of country .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 56]: That , the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness for the Crown , to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour , had communicated itself to the prisoner 's servant , and had engendered in him a holy determination to examine his master 's table-drawers and pockets , and secrete his papers .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 62]: That , he -LRB- Mr. Attorney -- General -RRB- was prepared to hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant ; but that , in a general way , he preferred him to his -LRB- Mr. Attorney -- General 's -RRB- brothers and sisters , and honoured him more than his -LRB- Mr. Attorney -- General 's -RRB- father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 15]: That , he called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 67]: That , the evidence of these two witnesses , coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be produced , would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of his Majesty 's forces , and of their disposition and preparation , both by sea and land , and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed such information to a hostile power .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 48]: That , these lists could not be proved to be in the prisoner 's handwriting ; but that it was all the same ; that , indeed , it was rather the better for the prosecution , as showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 43]: That , the proof would go back five years , and would show the prisoner already engaged in these pernicious missions , within a few weeks before the date of the very first action fought between the British troops and the Americans .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 55]: That , for these reasons , the jury , being a loyal jury -LRB- as he knew they were -RRB- , and being a responsible jury -LRB- as THEY knew they were -RRB- , must positively find the prisoner Guilty , and make an end of him , whether they liked it or not .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 81]: That , they never could lay their heads upon their pillows ; that , they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying their heads upon their pillows ; that , they never could endure the notion of their children laying their heads upon their pillows ; in short , that there never more could be , for them or theirs , any laying of heads upon pillows at all , unless the prisoner 's head was taken off .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 49]: That head Mr. Attorney -- General concluded by demanding of them , in the name of everything he could think of with a round turn in it , and on the faith of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as good as dead and gone .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 36]: When the Attorney -- General ceased , a buzz arose in the court as if a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner , in anticipation of what he was soon to become .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 13]: When toned down again , the unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 24]: Mr. Solicitor -- General then , following his leader 's lead , examined the patriot : John Barsad , gentleman , by name .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 32]: The story of his pure soul was exactly what Mr. Attorney -- General had described it to be -- perhaps , if it had a fault , a little too exactly .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 42]: Having released his noble bosom of its burden , he would have modestly withdrawn himself , but that the wigged gentleman with the papers before him , sitting not far from Mr. Lorry , begged to ask him a few questions .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 15]: The wigged gentleman sitting opposite , still looking at the ceiling of the court .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 8]: Had he ever been a spy himself ?
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 8]: No , he scorned the base insinuation .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 6]: What did he live upon ?
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 3]: His property .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 5]: Where was his property ?
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 9]: He did n't precisely remember where it was .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 4]: What was it ?
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 6]: No business of anybody 's .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 5]: Had he inherited it ?
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 5]: Yes , he had .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 3]: From whom ?
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 3]: Distant relation .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 3]: Very distant ?
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 2]: Rather .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 5]: Ever been in prison ?
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 3]: Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 7]: Never in a debtors ' prison ?
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 11]: Did n't see what that had to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 7]: Never in a debtors ' prison ?
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 6]: -- Come , once again .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 2]: Never ?
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 4]: How many times ?
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 5]: Two or three times .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 5]: Not five or six ?
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 2]: Perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 4]: Of what profession ?
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 2]: Gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 4]: Ever been kicked ?
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 4]: Might have been .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 2]: Frequently ?
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 4]: Ever kicked downstairs ?
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 22]: Decidedly not ; once received a kick on the top of a staircase , and fell downstairs of his own accord .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 9]: Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice ?
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 21]: Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who committed the assault , but it was not true .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 6]: Swear it was not true ?
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 2]: Positively .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 7]: Ever live by cheating at play ?
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 2]: Never .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 5]: Ever live by play ?
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 7]: Not more than other gentlemen do .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 7]: Ever borrow money of the prisoner ?
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 4]: Ever pay him ?
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 27]: Was not this intimacy with the prisoner , in reality a very slight one , forced upon the prisoner in coaches , inns , and packets ?
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 9]: Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists ?
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 2]: Certain .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 7]: Knew no more about the lists ?
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 9]: Had not procured them himself , for instance ?
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 8]: Expect to get anything by this evidence ?
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 12]: Not in regular government pay and employment , to lay traps ?
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 4]: Oh dear no .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 5]: Or to do anything ?
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 4]: Oh dear no .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 3]: Swear that ?
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 5]: Over and over again .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 8]: No motives but motives of sheer patriotism ?
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 3]: None whatever .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 18]: The virtuous servant , Roger Cly , swore his way through the case at a great rate .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 18]: He had taken service with the prisoner , in good faith and simplicity , four years ago .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 25]: He had asked the prisoner , aboard the Calais packet , if he wanted a handy fellow , and the prisoner had engaged him .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 24]: He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of charity -- never thought of such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 20]: He began to have suspicions of the prisoner , and to keep an eye upon him , soon afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 26]: In arranging his clothes , while travelling , he had seen similar lists to these in the prisoner 's pockets , over and over again .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 14]: He had taken these lists from the drawer of the prisoner 's desk .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 8]: He had not put them there first .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 28]: He had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen at Calais , and similar lists to French gentlemen , both at Calais and Boulogne .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 16]: He loved his country , and could n't bear it , and had given information .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 30]: He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot ; he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot , but it turned out to be only a plated one .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 17]: He had known the last witness seven or eight years ; that was merely a coincidence .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 15]: He did n't call it a particularly curious coincidence ; most coincidences were curious .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 17]: Neither did he call it a curious coincidence that true patriotism was HIS only motive too .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 14]: He was a true Briton , and hoped there were many like him .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 15]: The blue-flies buzzed again , and Mr. Attorney -- General called Mr. Jarvis Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 15]: `` Mr. Jarvis Lorry , are you a clerk in Tellson 's bank ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 5]: `` I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 30]: `` On a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five , did business occasion you to travel between London and Dover by the mail ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 5]: `` It did . ''
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 11]: `` Were there any other passengers in the mail ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 4]: `` Two . ''
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 15]: `` Did they alight on the road in the course of the night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 5]: `` They did . ''
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 9]: `` Mr. Lorry , look upon the prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 9]: Was he one of those two passengers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 12]: `` I can not undertake to say that he was . ''
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 11]: `` Does he resemble either of these two passengers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 32]: `` Both were so wrapped up , and the night was so dark , and we were all so reserved , that I can not undertake to say even that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 10]: `` Mr. Lorry , look again upon the prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 30]: Supposing him wrapped up as those two passengers were , is there anything in his bulk and stature to render it unlikely that he was one of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 18]: `` You will not swear , Mr. Lorry , that he was not one of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 15]: `` So at least you say he may have been one of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 27]: Except that I remember them both to have been -- like myself -- timorous of highwaymen , and the prisoner has not a timorous air . ''
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 14]: `` Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity , Mr. Lorry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 8]: `` I certainly have seen that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 11]: `` Mr. Lorry , look once more upon the prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 13]: Have you seen him , to your certain knowledge , before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 5]: `` I have . ''
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 4]: `` When ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 36]: `` I was returning from France a few days afterwards , and , at Calais , the prisoner came on board the packet-ship in which I returned , and made the voyage with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 11]: `` At what hour did he come on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 8]: `` At a little after midnight . ''
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 8]: `` In the dead of the night .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 15]: Was he the only passenger who came on board at that untimely hour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 10]: `` He happened to be the only one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 11]: `` Never mind about ` happening , ' Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 17]: He was the only passenger who came on board in the dead of the night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 5]: `` He was . ''
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 15]: `` Were you travelling alone , Mr. Lorry , or with any companion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 5]: `` With two companions .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 5]: A gentleman and lady .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 5]: They are here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 5]: `` They are here .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 9]: Had you any conversation with the prisoner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 4]: `` Hardly any .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 26]: The weather was stormy , and the passage long and rough , and I lay on a sofa , almost from shore to shore . ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 5]: `` Miss Manette ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 26]: The young lady , to whom all eyes had been turned before , and were now turned again , stood up where she had sat .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 15]: Her father rose with her , and kept her hand drawn through his arm .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 10]: `` Miss Manette , look upon the prisoner . ''
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 30]: To be confronted with such pity , and such earnest youth and beauty , was far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 38]: Standing , as it were , apart with her on the edge of his grave , not all the staring curiosity that looked on , could , for the moment , nerve him to remain quite still .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 40]: His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden ; and his efforts to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour rushed to his heart .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 10]: The buzz of the great flies was loud again .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 12]: `` Miss Manette , have you seen the prisoner before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 20]: `` On board of the packet-ship just now referred to , sir , and on the same occasion . ''
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 12]: `` You are the young lady just now referred to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 3]: `` O !
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 7]: most unhappily , I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 38]: The plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice of the Judge , as he said something fiercely : `` Answer the questions put to you , and make no remark upon them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 19]: `` Miss Manette , had you any conversation with the prisoner on that passage across the Channel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 5]: `` Recall it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 29]: In the midst of a profound stillness , she faintly began : `` When the gentleman came on board -- '' `` Do you mean the prisoner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 8]: inquired the Judge , knitting his brows .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 7]: `` Yes , my Lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 7]: `` Then say the prisoner . ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 40]: `` When the prisoner came on board , he noticed that my father , '' turning her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her , `` was much fatigued and in a very weak state of health .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 48]: My father was so reduced that I was afraid to take him out of the air , and I had made a bed for him on the deck near the cabin steps , and I sat on the deck at his side to take care of him .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 12]: There were no other passengers that night , but we four .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 30]: The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could shelter my father from the wind and weather , better than I had done .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 25]: I had not known how to do it well , not understanding how the wind would set when we were out of the harbour .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 6]: He did it for me .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 20]: He expressed great gentleness and kindness for my father 's state , and I am sure he felt it .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 12]: That was the manner of our beginning to speak together . ''
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 9]: `` Let me interrupt you for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 8]: Had he come on board alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 8]: `` How many were with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 6]: `` Two French gentlemen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 7]: `` Had they conferred together ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 26]: `` They had conferred together until the last moment , when it was necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 16]: `` Had any papers been handed about among them , similar to these lists ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 19]: `` Some papers had been handed about among them , but I do n't know what papers . ''
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 9]: `` Like these in shape and size ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 72]: `` Possibly , but indeed I do n't know , although they stood whispering very near to me : because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the light of the lamp that was hanging there ; it was a dull lamp , and they spoke very low , and I did not hear what they said , and saw only that they looked at papers . ''
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 13]: `` Now , to the prisoner 's conversation , Miss Manette . ''
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 34]: `` The prisoner was as open in his confidence with me -- which arose out of my helpless situation -- as he was kind , and good , and useful to my father .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 21]: I hope , '' bursting into tears , `` I may not repay him by doing him harm to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 5]: Buzzing from the blue-flies .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 52]: `` Miss Manette , if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that you give the evidence which it is your duty to give -- which you must give -- and which you can not escape from giving -- with great unwillingness , he is the only person present in that condition .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 6]: Please to go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 35]: `` He told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and difficult nature , which might get people into trouble , and that he was therefore travelling under an assumed name .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 40]: He said that this business had , within a few days , taken him to France , and might , at intervals , take him backwards and forwards between France and England for a long time to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 11]: `` Did he say anything about America , Miss Manette ?
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 4]: Be particular . ''
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 37]: `` He tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen , and he said that , so far as he could judge , it was a wrong and foolish one on England 's part .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 26]: He added , in a jesting way , that perhaps George Washington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the Third .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 24]: But there was no harm in his way of saying this : it was said laughingly , and to beguile the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 34]: Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed , will be unconsciously imitated by the spectators .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 39]: Her forehead was painfully anxious and intent as she gave this evidence , and , in the pauses when she stopped for the Judge to write it down , watched its effect upon the counsel for and against .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 52]: Among the lookers-on there was the same expression in all quarters of the court ; insomuch , that a great majority of the foreheads there , might have been mirrors reflecting the witness , when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous heresy about George Washington .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 35]: Mr. Attorney -- General now signified to my Lord , that he deemed it necessary , as a matter of precaution and form , to call the young lady 's father , Doctor Manette .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 5]: Who was called accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 9]: `` Doctor Manette , look upon the prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 8]: Have you ever seen him before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 3]: `` Once .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 9]: When he caged at my lodgings in London .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 13]: Some three years , or three years and a half ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 23]: `` Can you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet , or speak to his conversation with your daughter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 9]: `` Sir , I can do neither . ''
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 17]: `` Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 13]: He answered , in a low voice , `` There is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 28]: `` Has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment , without trial , or even accusation , in your native country , Doctor Manette ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 18]: He answered , in a tone that went to every heart , `` A long imprisonment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 12]: `` Were you newly released on the occasion in question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 7]: `` They tell me so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 10]: `` Have you no remembrance of the occasion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 3]: `` None .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 47]: My mind is a blank , from some time -- I can not even say what time -- when I employed myself , in my captivity , in making shoes , to the time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter here .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 30]: She had become familiar to me , when a gracious God restored my faculties ; but , I am quite unable even to say how she had become familiar .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 9]: I have no remembrance of the process . ''
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 16]: Mr. Attorney -- General sat down , and the father and daughter sat down together .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 9]: A singular circumstance then arose in the case .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 110]: The object in hand being to show that the prisoner went down , with some fellow-plotter untracked , in the Dover mail on that Friday night in November five years ago , and got out of the mail in the night , as a blind , at a place where he did not remain , but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more , to a garrison and dockyard , and there collected information ; a witness was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required , in the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard town , waiting for another person .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 65]: The prisoner 's counsel was cross-examining this witness with no result , except that he had never seen the prisoner on any other occasion , when the wigged gentleman who had all this time been looking at the ceiling of the court , wrote a word or two on a little piece of paper , screwed it up , and tossed it to him .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 22]: Opening this piece of paper in the next pause , the counsel looked with great attention and curiosity at the prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 15]: `` You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 6]: The witness was quite sure .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 12]: `` Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 15]: Not so like -LRB- the witness said -RRB- as that he could be mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 32]: `` Look well upon that gentleman , my learned friend there , '' pointing to him who had tossed the paper over , `` and then look well upon the prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 4]: How say you ?
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 8]: Are they very like each other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 41]: Allowing for my learned friend 's appearance being careless and slovenly if not debauched , they were sufficiently like each other to surprise , not only the witness , but everybody present , when they were thus brought into comparison .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 28]: My Lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside his wig , and giving no very gracious consent , the likeness became much more remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 31]: My Lord inquired of Mr. Stryver -LRB- the prisoner 's counsel -RRB- , whether they were next to try Mr. Carton -LRB- name of my learned friend -RRB- for treason ?
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 61]: But , Mr. Stryver replied to my Lord , no ; but he would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once , might happen twice ; whether he would have been so confident if he had seen this illustration of his rashness sooner , whether he would be so confident , having seen it ; and more .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 27]: The upshot of which , was , to smash this witness like a crockery vessel , and shiver his part of the case to useless lumber .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 22]: Mr. Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his fingers in his following of the evidence .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 65]: He had now to attend while Mr. Stryver fitted the prisoner 's case on the jury , like a compact suit of clothes ; showing them how the patriot , Barsad , was a hired spy and traitor , an unblushing trafficker in blood , and one of the greatest scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas -- which he certainly did look rather like .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 90]: How the virtuous servant , Cly , was his friend and partner , and was worthy to be ; how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim , because some family affairs in France , he being of French extraction , did require his making those passages across the Channel -- though what those affairs were , a consideration for others who were near and dear to him , forbade him , even for his life , to disclose .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 80]: How the evidence that had been warped and wrested from the young lady , whose anguish in giving it they had witnessed , came to nothing , involving the mere little innocent gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman and young lady so thrown together ; -- with the exception of that reference to George Washington , which was altogether too extravagant and impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 75]: How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies and fears , and therefore Mr. Attorney -- General had made the most of it ; how , nevertheless , it rested upon nothing , save that vile and infamous character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases , and of which the State Trials of this country were full .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 35]: But , there my Lord interposed -LRB- with as grave a face as if it had not been true -RRB- , saying that he could not sit upon that Bench and suffer those allusions .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 62]: Mr. Stryver then called his few witnesses , and Mr. Cruncher had next to attend while Mr. Attorney -- General turned the whole suit of clothes Mr. Stryver had fitted on the jury , inside out ; showing how Barsad and Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them , and the prisoner a hundred times worse .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 36]: Lastly , came my Lord himself , turning the suit of clothes , now inside out , now outside in , but on the whole decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 16]: And now , the jury turned to consider , and the great flies swarmed again .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 29]: Mr. Carton , who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court , changed neither his place nor his attitude , even in this excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 135]: While his teamed friend , Mr. Stryver , massing his papers before him , whispered with those who sat near , and from time to time glanced anxiously at the jury ; while all the spectators moved more or less , and grouped themselves anew ; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat , and slowly paced up and down his platform , not unattended by a suspicion in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish ; this one man sat leaning back , with his torn gown half off him , his untidy wig put on just as it had happened to fight on his head after its removal , his hands in his pockets , and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all day .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 70]: Something especially reckless in his demeanour , not only gave him a disreputable look , but so diminished the strong resemblance he undoubtedly bore to the prisoner -LRB- which his momentary earnestness , when they were compared together , had strengthened -RRB- , that many of the lookers-on , taking note of him now , said to one another they would hardly have thought the two were so alike .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 30]: Mr. Cruncher made the observation to his next neighbour , and added , `` I 'd hold half a guinea that HE do n't get no law-work to do .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 16]: Do n't look like the sort of one to get any , do he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 52]: Yet , this Mr. Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he appeared to take in ; for now , when Miss Manette 's head dropped upon her father 's breast , he was the first to see it , and to say audibly : `` Officer !
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 6]: look to that young lady .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 8]: Help the gentleman to take her out .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 9]: Do n't you see she will fall ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 18]: There was much commiseration for her as she was removed , and much sympathy with her father .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 19]: It had evidently been a great distress to him , to have the days of his imprisonment recalled .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 35]: He had shown strong internal agitation when he was questioned , and that pondering or brooding look which made him old , had been upon him , like a heavy cloud , ever since .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 23]: As he passed out , the jury , who had turned back and paused a moment , spoke , through their foreman .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 10]: They were not agreed , and wished to retire .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 37]: My Lord -LRB- perhaps with George Washington on his mind -RRB- showed some surprise that they were not agreed , but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward , and retired himself .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 18]: The trial had lasted all day , and the lamps in the court were now being lighted .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 15]: It began to be rumoured that the jury would be out a long while .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 23]: The spectators dropped off to get refreshment , and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock , and sat down .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 38]: Mr. Lorry , who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out , now reappeared , and beckoned to Jerry : who , in the slackened interest , could easily get near him .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 15]: `` Jerry , if you wish to take something to eat , you can .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 7]: But , keep in the way .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 12]: You will be sure to hear when the jury come in .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 21]: Do n't be a moment behind them , for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 20]: You are the quickest messenger I know , and will get to Temple Bar long before I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 21]: Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle , and he knuckled it in acknowedgment of this communication and a shilling .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 16]: Mr. Carton came up at the moment , and touched Mr. Lorry on the arm .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 8]: `` How is the young lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 25]: `` She is greatly distressed ; but her father is comforting her , and she feels the better for being out of court . ''
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 8]: `` I 'll tell the prisoner so .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 24]: It wo n't do for a respectable bank gentleman like you , to be seen speaking to him publicly , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 30]: Mr. Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point in his mind , and Mr. Carton made his way to the outside of the bar .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 23]: The way out of court lay in that direction , and Jerry followed him , all eyes , ears , and spikes .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 5]: `` Mr. Darnay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 6]: The prisoner came forward directly .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 15]: `` You will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness , Miss Manette .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 6]: She will do very well .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 10]: You have seen the worst of her agitation . ''
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 13]: `` I am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 14]: Could you tell her so for me , with my fervent acknowledgments ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 6]: `` Yes , I could .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 9]: I will , if you ask it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 13]: Mr. Carton 's manner was so careless as to be almost insolent .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 17]: He stood , half turned from the prisoner , lounging with his elbow against the bar .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 6]: `` I do ask it .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 6]: Accept my cordial thanks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 23]: `` What , '' said Carton , still only half turned towards him , `` do you expect , Mr. Darnay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 5]: `` The worst . ''
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 13]: `` It 's the wisest thing to expect , and the likeliest .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 11]: But I think their withdrawing is in your favour . ''
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 47]: Loitering on the way out of court not being allowed , Jerry heard no more : but left them -- so like each other in feature , so unlike each other in manner -- standing side by side , both reflected in the glass above them .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 25]: An hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal crowded passages below , even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 46]: The hoarse messenger , uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that refection , had dropped into a doze , when a loud murmur and a rapid tide of people setting up the stairs that led to the court , carried him along with them .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 3]: `` Jerry !
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 3]: Jerry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 13]: Mr. Lorry was already calling at the door when he got there .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 5]: `` Here , sir !
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 9]: It 's a fight to get back again .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 7]: Here I am , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 10]: Mr. Lorry handed him a paper through the throng .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 3]: `` Quick !
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 6]: Have you got it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 12]: Hastily written on the paper was the word `` AQUITTED . ''
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 37]: `` If you had sent the message , ` Recalled to Life , ' again , '' muttered Jerry , as he turned , `` I should have known what you meant , this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 64]: He had no opportunity of saying , or so much as thinking , anything else , until he was clear of the Old Bailey ; for , the crowd came pouring out with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs , and a loud buzz swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in search of other carrion .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 73]: IV Congratulatory From the dimly-lighted passages of the court , the last sediment of the human stew that had been boiling there all day , was straining off , when Doctor Manette , Lucie Manette , his daughter , Mr. Lorry , the solicitor for the defence , and its counsel , Mr. Stryver , stood gathered round Mr. Charles Darnay -- just released -- congratulating him on his escape from death .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 33]: It would have been difficult by a far brighter light , to recognise in Doctor Manette , intellectual of face and upright of bearing , the shoemaker of the garret in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 48]: Yet , no one could have looked at him twice , without looking again : even though the opportunity of observation had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice , and to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully , without any apparent reason .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 88]: While one external cause , and that a reference to his long lingering agony , would always -- as on the trial -- evoke this condition from the depths of his soul , it was also in its nature to arise of itself , and to draw a gloom over him , as incomprehensible to those unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual Bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun , when the substance was three hundred miles away .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 15]: Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from his mind .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 52]: She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his misery , and to a Present beyond his misery : and the sound of her voice , the light of her face , the touch of her hand , had a strong beneficial influence with him almost always .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 30]: Not absolutely always , for she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed ; but they were few and slight , and she believed them over .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 22]: Mr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully , and had turned to Mr. Stryver , whom he warmly thanked .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 65]: Mr. Stryver , a man of little more than thirty , but looking twenty years older than he was , stout , loud , red , bluff , and free from any drawback of delicacy , had a pushing way of shouldering himself -LRB- morally and physically -RRB- into companies and conversations , that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 50]: He still had his wig and gown on , and he said , squaring himself at his late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean out of the group : `` I am glad to have brought you off with honour , Mr. Darnay .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 21]: It was an infamous prosecution , grossly infamous ; but not the less likely to succeed on that account . ''
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 27]: `` You have laid me under an obligation to you for life -- in two senses , '' said his late client , taking his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 27]: `` I have done my best for you , Mr. Darnay ; and my best is as good as another man 's , I believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 36]: It clearly being incumbent on some one to say , `` Much better , '' Mr. Lorry said it ; perhaps not quite disinterestedly , but with the interested object of squeezing himself back again .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 6]: `` You think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 4]: said Mr. Stryver .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 13]: you have been present all day , and you ought to know .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 10]: You are a man of business , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 59]: `` And as such , '' quoth Mr. Lorry , whom the counsel learned in the law had now shouldered back into the group , just as he had previously shouldered him out of it -- `` as such I will appeal to Doctor Manette , to break up this conference and order us all to our homes .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 19]: Miss Lucie looks ill , Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day , we are worn out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 23]: `` Speak for yourself , Mr. Lorry , '' said Stryver ; `` I have a night 's work to do yet .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 5]: Speak for yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 39]: `` I speak for myself , '' answered Mr. Lorry , `` and for Mr. Darnay , and for Miss Lucie , and -- Miss Lucie , do you not think I may speak for us all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 15]: He asked her the question pointedly , and with a glance at her father .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 37]: His face had become frozen , as it were , in a very curious look at Darnay : an intent look , deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust , not even unmixed with fear .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 12]: With this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 15]: `` My father , '' said Lucie , softly laying her hand on his .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 12]: He slowly shook the shadow off , and turned to her .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 10]: `` Shall we go home , my father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 11]: With a long breath , he answered `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 28]: The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed , under the impression -- which he himself had originated -- that he would not be released that night .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 48]: The lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages , the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle , and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning 's interest of gallows , pillory , whipping-post , and branding-iron , should repeople it .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 16]: Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay , Lucie Manette passed into the open air .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 14]: A hackney-coach was called , and the father and daughter departed in it .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 18]: Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages , to shoulder his way back to the robing-room .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 52]: Another person , who had not joined the group , or interchanged a word with any one of them , but who had been leaning against the wall where its shadow was darkest , had silently strolled out after the rest , and had looked on until the coach drove away .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 16]: He now stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 6]: `` So , Mr. Lorry !
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 11]: Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 22]: Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton 's part in the day 's proceedings ; nobody had known of it .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 14]: He was unrobed , and was none the better for it in appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 36]: `` If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind , when the business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business appearances , you would be amused , Mr. Darnay . ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 18]: Mr. Lorry reddened , and said , warmly , `` You have mentioned that before , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 16]: We men of business , who serve a House , are not our own masters .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 12]: We have to think of the House more than ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 14]: `` I know , I know , '' rejoined Mr. Carton , carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 9]: `` Do n't be nettled , Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 19]: You are as good as another , I have no doubt : better , I dare say . ''
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 30]: `` And indeed , sir , '' pursued Mr. Lorry , not minding him , `` I really do n't know what you have to do with the matter .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 28]: If you 'll excuse me , as very much your elder , for saying so , I really do n't know that it is your business . ''
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 3]: `` Business !
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 13]: Bless you , I have no business , '' said Mr. Carton .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 12]: `` It is a pity you have not , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 8]: `` I think so , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 19]: `` If you had , '' pursued Mr. Lorry , `` perhaps you would attend to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 7]: `` Lord love you , no !
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 10]: -- I should n't , '' said Mr. Carton .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 6]: `` Well , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 24]: cried Mr. Lorry , thoroughly heated by his indifference , `` business is a very good thing , and a very respectable thing .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 32]: And , sir , if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments , Mr. Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance for that circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 12]: Mr. Darnay , good night , God bless you , sir !
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 15]: I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy life .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 5]: -- Chair there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 29]: Perhaps a little angry with himself , as well as with the barrister , Mr. Lorry bustled into the chair , and was carried off to Tellson 's .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 38]: Carton , who smelt of port wine , and did not appear to be quite sober , laughed then , and turned to Darnay : `` This is a strange chance that throws you and me together .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 21]: This must be a strange night to you , standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 20]: `` I hardly seem yet , '' returned Charles Darnay , `` to belong to this world again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 25]: `` I do n't wonder at it ; it 's not so long since you were pretty far advanced on your way to another .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 5]: You speak faintly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 10]: `` I begin to think I AM faint . ''
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 10]: `` Then why the devil do n't you dine ?
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 23]: I dined , myself , while those numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to -- this , or some other .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 13]: Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at . ''
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 27]: Drawing his arm through his own , he took him down Ludgate-hill to Fleet-street , and so , up a covered way , into a tavern .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 55]: Here , they were shown into a little room , where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine : while Carton sat opposite to him at the same table , with his separate bottle of port before him , and his fully half-insolent manner upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 20]: `` Do you feel , yet , that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again , Mr. Darnay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 22]: `` I am frightfully confused regarding time and place ; but I am so far mended as to feel that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 9]: `` It must be an immense satisfaction ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 18]: He said it bitterly , and filled up his glass again : which was a large one .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 20]: `` As to me , the greatest desire I have , is to forget that I belong to it .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 19]: It has no good in it for me -- except wine like this -- nor I for it .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 10]: So we are not much alike in that particular .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 62]: Indeed , I begin to think we are not much alike in any particular , you and I. '' Confused by the emotion of the day , and feeling his being there with this Double of coarse deportment , to be like a dream , Charles Darnay was at a loss how to answer ; finally , answered not at all .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 33]: `` Now your dinner is done , '' Carton presently said , `` why do n't you call a health , Mr. Darnay ; why do n't you give your toast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 4]: `` What health ?
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 4]: What toast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 12]: `` Why , it 's on the tip of your tongue .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 17]: It ought to be , it must be , I 'll swear it 's there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 7]: `` Miss Manette , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 7]: `` Miss Manette , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 41]: Looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast , Carton flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall , where it shivered to pieces ; then , rang the bell , and ordered in another .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 20]: `` That 's a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark , Mr. Darnay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 8]: he said , ruing his new goblet .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 14]: A slight frown and a laconic `` Yes , '' were the answer .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 16]: `` That 's a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by !
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 5]: How does it feel ?
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 24]: Is it worth being tried for one 's life , to be the object of such sympathy and compassion , Mr. Darnay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 7]: Again Darnay answered not a word .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 16]: `` She was mightily pleased to have your message , when I gave it her .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 15]: Not that she showed she was pleased , but I suppose she was . ''
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 30]: The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had , of his own free will , assisted him in the strait of the day .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 14]: He turned the dialogue to that point , and thanked him for it .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 17]: `` I neither want any thanks , nor merit any , '' was the careless rejoinder .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 26]: `` It was nothing to do , in the first place ; and I do n't know why I did it , in the second .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 11]: Mr. Darnay , let me ask you a question . ''
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 13]: `` Willingly , and a small return for your good offices . ''
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 10]: `` Do you think I particularly like you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 24]: `` Really , Mr. Carton , '' returned the other , oddly disconcerted , `` I have not asked myself the question . ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 9]: `` But ask yourself the question now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 18]: `` You have acted as if you do ; but I do n't think you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 12]: `` I do n't think I do , '' said Carton .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 14]: `` I begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding . ''
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 40]: `` Nevertheless , '' pursued Darnay , rising to ring the bell , `` there is nothing in that , I hope , to prevent my calling the reckoning , and our parting without ill-blood on either side . ''
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 9]: Carton rejoining , `` Nothing in life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 3]: Darnay rang .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 9]: `` Do you call the whole reckoning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 3]: said Carton .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 29]: On his answering in the affirmative , `` Then bring me another pint of this same wine , drawer , and come and wake me at ten . ''
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 14]: The bill being paid , Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 38]: Without returning the wish , Carton rose too , with something of a threat of defiance in his manner , and said , `` A last word , Mr. Darnay : you think I am drunk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 12]: `` I think you have been drinking , Mr. Carton . ''
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 3]: `` Think ?
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 8]: You know I have been drinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 12]: `` Since I must say so , I know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 8]: `` Then you shall likewise know why .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 8]: I am a disappointed drudge , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 18]: I care for no man on earth , and no man on earth cares for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 6]: `` Much to be regretted .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 9]: You might have used your talents better . ''
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 12]: `` May be so , Mr. Darnay ; may be not .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 21]: Do n't let your sober face elate you , however ; you do n't know what it may come to .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 4]: Good night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 31]: When he was left alone , this strange being took up a candle , went to a glass that hung against the wall , and surveyed himself minutely in it .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 9]: `` Do you particularly like the man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 20]: he muttered , at his own image ; `` why should you particularly like a man who resembles you ?
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 12]: There is nothing in you to like ; you know that .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 5]: Ah , confound you !
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 9]: What a change you have made in yourself !
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 27]: A good reason for taking to a man , that he shows you what you have fallen away from , and what you might have been !
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 30]: Change places with him , and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was , and commiserated by that agitated face as he was ?
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 11]: Come on , and have it out in plain words !
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 6]: You hate the fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 45]: He resorted to his pint of wine for consolation , drank it all in a few minutes , and fell asleep on his arms , with his hair straggling over the table , and a long winding-sheet in the candle dripping down upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 14]: V The Jackal Those were drinking days , and most men drank hard .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 59]: So very great is the improvement Time has brought about in such habits , that a moderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow in the course of a night , without any detriment to his reputation as a perfect gentleman , would seem , in these days , a ridiculous exaggeration .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 55]: The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other learned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities ; neither was Mr. Stryver , already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative practice , behind his compeers in this particular , any more than in the drier parts of the legal race .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 32]: A favourite at the Old Bailey , and eke at the Sessions , Mr. Stryver had begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which he mounted .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 75]: Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite , specially , to their longing arms ; and shouldering itself towards the visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King 's Bench , the florid countenance of Mr. Stryver might be daily seen , bursting out of the bed of wigs , like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from among a rank garden-full of flaring companions .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 59]: It had once been noted at the Bar , that while Mr. Stryver was a glib man , and an unscrupulous , and a ready , and a bold , he had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements , which is among the most striking and necessary of the advocate 's accomplishments .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 12]: But , a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 47]: The more business he got , the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith and marrow ; and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney Carton , he always had his points at his fingers ' ends in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 16]: Sydney Carton , idlest and most unpromising of men , was Stryver 's great ally .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 20]: What the two drank together , between Hilary Term and Michaelmas , might have floated a king 's ship .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 74]: Stryver never had a case in hand , anywhere , but Carton was there , with his hands in his pockets , staring at the ceiling of the court ; they went the same Circuit , and even there they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night , and Carton was rumoured to be seen at broad day , going home stealthily and unsteadily to his lodgings , like a dissipated cat .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 49]: At last , it began to get about , among such as were interested in the matter , that although Sydney Carton would never be a lion , he was an amazingly good jackal , and that he rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 29]: `` Ten o'clock , sir , '' said the man at the tavern , whom he had charged to wake him -- `` ten o'clock , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 7]: `` WHAT 'S the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 7]: `` Ten o'clock , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 6]: `` What do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 6]: Ten o'clock at night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 9]: Your honour told me to call you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 3]: I remember .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 7]: Very well , very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 38]: After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again , which the man dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes , he got up , tossed his hat on , and walked out .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 29]: He turned into the Temple , and , having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of King 's Bench-walk and Paper-buildings , turned into the Stryver chambers .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 23]: The Stryver clerk , who never assisted at these conferences , had gone home , and the Stryver principal opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 21]: He had his slippers on , and a loose bed-gown , and his throat was bare for his greater ease .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 53]: He had that rather wild , strained , seared marking about the eyes , which may be observed in all free livers of his class , from the portrait of Jeffries downward , and which can be traced , under various disguises of Art , through the portraits of every Drinking Age .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 13]: `` You are a little late , Memory , '' said Stryver .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 17]: `` About the usual time ; it may be a quarter of an hour later . ''
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 21]: They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers , where there was a blazing fire .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 39]: A kettle steamed upon the hob , and in the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone , with plenty of wine upon it , and brandy , and rum , and sugar , and lemons .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 13]: `` You have had your bottle , I perceive , Sydney . ''
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 7]: `` Two to-night , I think .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 21]: I have been dining with the day 's client ; or seeing him dine -- it 's all one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 18]: `` That was a rare point , Sydney , that you brought to bear upon the identification .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 7]: How did you come by it ?
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 7]: When did it strike you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 32]: `` I thought he was rather a handsome fellow , and I thought I should have been much the same sort of fellow , if I had had any luck . ''
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 10]: Mr. Stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 8]: `` You and your luck , Sydney !
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 9]: Get to work , get to work . ''
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 35]: Sullenly enough , the jackal loosened his dress , went into an adjoining room , and came back with a large jug of cold water , a basin , and a towel or two .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 42]: Steeping the towels in the water , and partially wringing them out , he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold , sat down at the table , and said , `` Now I am ready ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 26]: `` Not much boiling down to be done to-night , Memory , '' said Mr. Stryver , gaily , as he looked among his papers .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 5]: `` How much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 8]: `` Only two sets of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 8]: `` Give me the worst first . ''
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 7]: `` There they are , Sydney .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 4]: Fire away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 46]: The lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the drinking-table , while the jackal sat at his own paper-bestrewn table proper , on the other side of it , with the bottles and glasses ready to his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 94]: Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint , but each in a different way ; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in his waistband , looking at the fire , or occasionally flirting with some lighter document ; the jackal , with knitted brows and intent face , so deep in his task , that his eyes did not even follow the hand he stretched out for his glass -- which often groped about , for a minute or more , before it found the glass for his lips .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 31]: Two or three times , the matter in hand became so knotty , that the jackal found it imperative on him to get up , and steep his towels anew .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 34]: From these pilgrimages to the jug and basin , he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as no words can describe ; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious gravity .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 22]: At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion , and proceeded to offer it to him .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 27]: The lion took it with care and caution , made his selections from it , and his remarks upon it , and the jackal assisted both .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 23]: When the repast was fully discussed , the lion put his hands in his waistband again , and lay down to mediate .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 56]: The jackal then invigorated himself with a bum for his throttle , and a fresh application to his head , and applied himself to the collection of a second meal ; this was administered to the lion in the same manner , and was not disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 20]: `` And now we have done , Sydney , fill a bumper of punch , '' said Mr. Stryver .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 25]: The jackal removed the towels from his head , which had been steaming again , shook himself , yawned , shivered , and complied .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 17]: `` You were very sound , Sydney , in the matter of those crown witnesses to-day .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 5]: Every question told . ''
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 11]: `` I always am sound ; am I not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 7]: `` I do n't gainsay it .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 6]: What has roughened your temper ?
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 11]: Put some punch to it and smooth it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 10]: With a deprecatory grunt , the jackal again complied .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 36]: `` The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School , '' said Stryver , nodding his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past , `` the old seesaw Sydney .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 17]: Up one minute and down the next ; now in spirits and now in despondency ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 9]: returned the other , sighing : `` yes !
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 9]: The same Sydney , with the same luck .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 16]: Even then , I did exercises for other boys , and seldom did my own .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 6]: `` And why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 4]: `` God knows .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 9]: It was my way , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 22]: He sat , with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before him , looking at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 69]: `` Carton , '' said his friend , squaring himself at him with a bullying air , as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour was forged , and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it , `` your way is , and always was , a lame way .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 7]: You summon no energy and purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 5]: Look at me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 6]: `` Oh , botheration ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 19]: returned Sydney , with a lighter and more good-humoured laugh , `` do n't YOU be moral ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 11]: `` How have I done what I have done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 13]: said Stryver ; `` how do I do what I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 12]: `` Partly through paying me to help you , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 27]: But it 's not worth your while to apostrophise me , or the air , about it ; what you want to do , you do .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 15]: You were always in the front rank , and I was always behind . ''
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 20]: `` I had to get into the front rank ; I was not born there , was I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 20]: `` I was not present at the ceremony ; but my opinion is you were , '' said Carton .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 12]: At this , he laughed again , and they both laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 32]: `` Before Shrewsbury , and at Shrewsbury , and ever since Shrewsbury , '' pursued Carton , `` you have fallen into your rank , and I have fallen into mine .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 46]: Even when we were fellow-students in the Student -- Quarter of Paris , picking up French , and French law , and other French crumbs that we did n't get much good of , you were always somewhere , and I was always nowhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 8]: `` And whose fault was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 15]: `` Upon my soul , I am not sure that it was not yours .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 29]: You were always driving and riving and shouldering and passing , to that restless degree that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 21]: It 's a gloomy thing , however , to talk about one 's own past , with the day breaking .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 11]: Turn me in some other direction before I go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 4]: `` Well then !
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 16]: Pledge me to the pretty witness , '' said Stryver , holding up his glass .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 10]: `` Are you turned in a pleasant direction ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 9]: Apparently not , for he became gloomy again .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 14]: `` Pretty witness , '' he muttered , looking down into his glass .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 18]: `` I have had enough of witnesses to-day and to-night ; who 's your pretty witness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 11]: `` The picturesque doctor 's daughter , Miss Manette . ''
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 5]: `` SHE pretty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 6]: `` Is she not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 16]: `` Why , man alive , she was the admiration of the whole Court ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 9]: `` Rot the admiration of the whole Court !
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 10]: Who made the Old Bailey a judge of beauty ?
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 7]: She was a golden-haired doll ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 63]: `` Do you know , Sydney , '' said Mr. Stryver , looking at him with sharp eyes , and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face : `` do you know , I rather thought , at the time , that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll , and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 7]: `` Quick to see what happened !
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 29]: If a girl , doll or no doll , swoons within a yard or two of a man 's nose , he can see it without a perspective-glass .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 10]: I pledge you , but I deny the beauty .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 16]: And now I 'll have no more drink ; I 'll get to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 31]: When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle , to light him down the stairs , the day was coldly looking in through its grimy windows .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 34]: When he got out of the house , the air was cold and sad , the dull sky overcast , the river dark and dim , the whole scene like a lifeless desert .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 39]: And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round before the morning blast , as if the desert-sand had risen far away , and the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 47]: Waste forces within him , and a desert all around , this man stood still on his way across a silent terrace , and saw for a moment , lying in the wilderness before him , a mirage of honourable ambition , self-denial , and perseverance .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 41]: In the fair city of this vision , there were airy galleries from which the loves and graces looked upon him , gardens in which the fruits of life hung ripening , waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 8]: A moment , and it was gone .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 32]: Climbing to a high chamber in a well of houses , he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed , and its pillow was wet with wasted tears .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 57]: Sadly , sadly , the sun rose ; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions , incapable of their directed exercise , incapable of his own help and his own happiness , sensible of the blight on him , and resigning himself to let it eat him away .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 20]: VI Hundreds of People The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not far from Soho-square .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 62]: On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the waves of four months had roiled over the trial for treason , and carried it , as to the public interest and memory , far out to sea , Mr. Jarvis Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived , on his way to dine with the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 27]: After several relapses into business-absorption , Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor 's friend , and the quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 23]: On this certain fine Sunday , Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho , early in the afternoon , for three reasons of habit .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 95]: Firstly , because , on fine Sundays , he often walked out , before dinner , with the Doctor and Lucie ; secondly , because , on unfavourable Sundays , he was accustomed to be with them as the family friend , talking , reading , looking out of window , and generally getting through the day ; thirdly , because he happened to have his own little shrewd doubts to solve , and knew how the ways of the Doctor 's household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving them .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 19]: A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived , was not to be found in London .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 33]: There was no way through it , and the front windows of the Doctor 's lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that had a congenial air of retirement on it .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 31]: There were few buildings then , north of the Oxford-road , and forest-trees flourished , and wild flowers grew , and the hawthorn blossomed , in the now vanished fields .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 48]: As a consequence , country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom , instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a settlement ; and there was many a good south wall , not far off , on which the peaches ripened in their season .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 49]: The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part of the day ; but , when the streets grew hot , the corner was in shadow , though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a glare of brightness .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 25]: It was a cool spot , staid but cheerful , a wonderful place for echoes , and a very harbour from the raging streets .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 17]: There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage , and there was .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 40]: The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house , where several callings purported to be pursued by day , but whereof little was audible any day , and which was shunned by all of them at night .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 73]: In a building at the back , attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree rustled its green leaves , church-organs claimed to be made , and silver to be chased , and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall -- as if he had beaten himself precious , and menaced a similar conversion of all visitors .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 35]: Very little of these trades , or of a lonely lodger rumoured to live up-stairs , or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have a counting-house below , was ever heard or seen .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 39]: Occasionally , a stray workman putting his coat on , traversed the hall , or a stranger peered about there , or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard , or a thump from the golden giant .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 43]: These , however , were only the exceptions required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind the house , and the echoes in the corner before it , had their own way from Sunday morning unto Saturday night .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 25]: Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation , and its revival in the floating whispers of his story , brought him .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 30]: His scientific knowledge , and his vigilance and skill in conducting ingenious experiments , brought him otherwise into moderate request , and he earned as much as he wanted .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 34]: These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry 's knowledge , thoughts , and notice , when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner , on the fine Sunday afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 7]: `` Doctor Manette at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 3]: Expected home .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 7]: `` Miss Lucie at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 3]: Expected home .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 7]: `` Miss Pross at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 27]: Possibly at home , but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to anticipate intentions of Miss Pross , as to admission or denial of the fact .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 20]: `` As I am at home myself , '' said Mr. Lorry , `` I 'll go upstairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 44]: Although the Doctor 's daughter had known nothing of the country of her birth , she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to make much of little means , which is one of its most useful and most agreeable characteristics .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 32]: Simple as the furniture was , it was set off by so many little adornments , of no value but for their taste and fancy , that its effect was delightful .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 97]: The disposition of everything in the rooms , from the largest object to the least ; the arrangement of colours , the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles , by delicate hands , clear eyes , and good sense ; were at once so pleasant in themselves , and so expressive of their originator , that , as Mr. Lorry stood looking about him , the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him , with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this time , whether he approved ?
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 51]: There were three rooms on a floor , and , the doors by which they communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them all , Mr. Lorry , smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which he detected all around him , walked from one to another .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 111]: The first was the best room , and in it were Lucie 's birds , and flowers , and books , and desk , and work-table , and box of water-colours ; the second was the Doctor 's consulting-room , used also as the dining-room ; the third , changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard , was the Doctor 's bedroom , and there , in a corner , stood the disused shoemaker 's bench and tray of tools , much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the dismal house by the wine-shop , in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 28]: `` I wonder , '' said Mr. Lorry , pausing in his looking about , `` that he keeps that reminder of his sufferings about him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 8]: `` And why wonder at that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 9]: was the abrupt inquiry that made him start .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 34]: It proceeded from Miss Pross , the wild red woman , strong of hand , whose acquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover , and had since improved .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 11]: `` I should have thought -- '' Mr. Lorry began .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 3]: `` Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 6]: You 'd have thought ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 10]: said Miss Pross ; and Mr. Lorry left off .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 7]: `` How do you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 20]: inquired that lady then -- sharply , and yet as if to express that she bore him no malice .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 24]: `` I am pretty well , I thank you , '' answered Mr. Lorry , with meekness ; `` how are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 11]: `` Nothing to boast of , '' said Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 4]: `` Indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 3]: indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 4]: said Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 12]: `` I am very much put out about my Ladybird . ''
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 4]: `` Indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 35]: `` For gracious sake say something else besides ` indeed , ' or you 'll fidget me to death , '' said Miss Pross : whose character -LRB- dissociated from stature -RRB- was shortness .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 6]: `` Really , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 8]: said Mr. Lorry , as an amendment .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 16]: `` Really , is bad enough , '' returned Miss Pross , `` but better .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 10]: Yes , I am very much put out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 8]: `` May I ask the cause ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 29]: `` I do n't want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird , to come here looking after her , '' said Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 9]: `` DO dozens come for that purpose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 8]: `` Hundreds , '' said Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 30]: It was characteristic of this lady -LRB- as of some other people before her time and since -RRB- that whenever her original proposition was questioned , she exaggerated it .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 5]: `` Dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 13]: said Mr. Lorry , as the safest remark he could think of .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 57]: `` I have lived with the darling -- or the darling has lived with me , and paid me for it ; which she certainly should never have done , you may take your affidavit , if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her for nothing -- since she was ten years old .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 12]: And it 's really very hard , '' said Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 32]: Not seeing with precision what was very hard , Mr. Lorry shook his head ; using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would fit anything .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 27]: `` All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet , are always turning up , '' said Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 16]: `` When you began it -- '' `` I began it , Miss Pross ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 5]: `` Did n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 8]: Who brought her father to life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 11]: If THAT was beginning it -- '' said Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 10]: `` It was n't ending it , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 59]: I say , when you began it , it was hard enough ; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette , except that he is not worthy of such a daughter , which is no imputation on him , for it was not to be expected that anybody should be , under any circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 37]: But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds and multitudes of people turning up after him -LRB- I could have forgiven him -RRB- , to take Ladybird 's affections away from me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 91]: Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous , but he also knew her by this time to be , beneath the service of her eccentricity , one of those unselfish creatures -- found only among women -- who will , for pure love and admiration , bind themselves willing slaves , to youth when they have lost it , to beauty that they never had , to accomplishments that they were never fortunate enough to gain , to bright hopes that never shone upon their own sombre lives .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 93]: He knew enough of the world to know that there is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart ; so rendered and so free from any mercenary taint , he had such an exalted respect for it , that in the retributive arrangements made by his own mind -- we all make such arrangements , more or less -- he stationed Miss Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably better got up both by Nature and Art , who had balances at Tellson 's .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 40]: `` There never was , nor will be , but one man worthy of Ladybird , '' said Miss Pross ; `` and that was my brother Solomon , if he had n't made a mistake in life . ''
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 57]: Here again : Mr. Lorry 's inquiries into Miss Pross 's personal history had established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed , as a stake to speculate with , and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore , with no touch of compunction .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 38]: Miss Pross 's fidelity of belief in Solomon -LRB- deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake -RRB- was quite a serious matter with Mr. Lorry , and had its weight in his good opinion of her .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 64]: `` As we happen to be alone for the moment , and are both people of business , '' he said , when they had got back to the drawing-room and had sat down there in friendly relations , `` let me ask you -- does the Doctor , in talking with Lucie , never refer to the shoemaking time , yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 4]: `` Never . ''
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 13]: `` And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 8]: returned Miss Pross , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 16]: `` But I do n't say he do n't refer to it within himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 12]: `` Do you believe that he thinks of it much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 9]: `` I do , '' said Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 25]: `` Do you imagine -- '' Mr. Lorry had begun , when Miss Pross took him up short with : `` Never imagine anything .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 7]: Have no imagination at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 20]: `` I stand corrected ; do you suppose -- you go so far as to suppose , sometimes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 10]: `` Now and then , '' said Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 65]: `` Do you suppose , '' Mr. Lorry went on , with a laughing twinkle in his bright eye , as it looked kindly at her , `` that Doctor Manette has any theory of his own , preserved through all those years , relative to the cause of his being so oppressed ; perhaps , even to the name of his oppressor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 15]: `` I do n't suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 7]: `` And that is -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 8]: `` That she thinks he has . ''
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 32]: `` Now do n't be angry at my asking all these questions ; because I am a mere dull man of business , and you are a woman of business . ''
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 4]: `` Dull ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 7]: Miss Pross inquired , with placidity .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 18]: Rather wishing his modest adjective away , Mr. Lorry replied , `` No , no , no .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 3]: Surely not .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 35]: To return to business : -- Is it not remarkable that Doctor Manette , unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured he is , should never touch upon that question ?
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 48]: I will not say with me , though he had business relations with me many years ago , and we are now intimate ; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly attached , and who is so devotedly attached to him ?
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 26]: Believe me , Miss Pross , I do n't approach the topic with you , out of curiosity , but out of zealous interest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 41]: To the best of my understanding , and bad 's the best , you 'll tell me , '' said Miss Pross , softened by the tone of the apology , `` he is afraid of the whole subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 4]: `` Afraid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 15]: `` It 's plain enough , I should think , why he may be .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 6]: It 's a dreadful remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 12]: Besides that , his loss of himself grew out of it .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 24]: Not knowing how he lost himself , or how he recovered himself , he may never feel certain of not losing himself again .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 14]: That alone would n't make the subject pleasant , I should think . ''
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 12]: It was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 14]: `` True , '' said he , `` and fearful to reflect upon .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 29]: Yet , a doubt lurks in my mind , Miss Pross , whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression always shut up within him .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 23]: Indeed , it is this doubt and the uneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence . ''
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 15]: `` Ca n't be helped , '' said Miss Pross , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 13]: `` Touch that string , and he instantly changes for the worse .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 5]: Better leave it alone .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 13]: In short , must leave it alone , like or no like .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 36]: Sometimes , he gets up in the dead of the night , and will be heard , by us overhead there , walking up and down , walking up and down , in his room .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 25]: Ladybird has learnt to know then that his mind is walking up and down , walking up and down , in his old prison .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 26]: She hurries to him , and they go on together , walking up and down , walking up and down , until he is composed .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 30]: But he never says a word of the true reason of his restlessness , to her , and she finds it best not to hint at it to him .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 28]: In silence they go walking up and down together , walking up and down together , till her love and company have brought him to himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 47]: Notwithstanding Miss Pross 's denial of her own imagination , there was a perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea , in her repetition of the phrase , walking up and down , which testified to her possessing such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 46]: The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes ; it had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet , that it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 6]: `` Here they are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 24]: said Miss Pross , rising to break up the conference ; `` and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 47]: It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties , such a peculiar Ear of a place , that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window , looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard , he fancied they would never approach .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 44]: Not only would the echoes die away , as though the steps had gone ; but , echoes of other steps that never came would be heard in their stead , and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 23]: However , father and daughter did at last appear , and Miss Pross was ready at the street door to receive them .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 84]: Miss Pross was a pleasant sight , albeit wild , and red , and grim , taking off her darling 's bonnet when she came up-stairs , and touching it up with the ends of her handkerchief , and blowing the dust off it , and folding her mantle ready for laying by , and smoothing her rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had been the vainest and handsomest of women .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 51]: Her darling was a pleasant sight too , embracing her and thanking her , and protesting against her taking so much trouble for her -- which last she only dared to do playfully , or Miss Pross , sorely hurt , would have retired to her own chamber and cried .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 49]: The Doctor was a pleasant sight too , looking on at them , and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie , in accents and with eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had , and would have had more if it were possible .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 34]: Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too , beaming at all this in his little wig , and thanking his bachelor stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 27]: But , no Hundreds of people came to see the sights , and Mr. Lorry looked in vain for the fulfilment of Miss Pross 's prediction .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 9]: Dinner-time , and still no Hundreds of people .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 23]: In the arrangements of the little household , Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions , and always acquitted herself marvellously .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 37]: Her dinners , of a very modest quality , were so well cooked and so well served , and so neat in their contrivances , half English and half French , that nothing could be better .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 41]: Miss Pross 's friendship being of the thoroughly practical kind , she had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces , in search of impoverished French , who , tempted by shillings and half-crowns , would impart culinary mysteries to her .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 66]: From these decayed sons and daughters of Gaul , she had acquired such wonderful arts , that the woman and girl who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress , or Cinderella 's Godmother : who would send out for a fowl , a rabbit , a vegetable or two from the garden , and change them into anything she pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 56]: On Sundays , Miss Pross dined at the Doctor 's table , but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods , either in the lower regions , or in her own room on the second floor -- a blue chamber , to which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 32]: On this occasion , Miss Pross , responding to Ladybird 's pleasant face and pleasant efforts to please her , unbent exceedingly ; so the dinner was very pleasant , too .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 33]: It was an oppressive day , and , after dinner , Lucie proposed that the wine should be carried out under the plane-tree , and they should sit there in the air .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 32]: As everything turned upon her , and revolved about her , they went out under the plane-tree , and she carried the wine down for the special benefit of Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 31]: She had installed herself , some time before , as Mr. Lorry 's cup-bearer ; and while they sat under the plane-tree , talking , she kept his glass replenished .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 27]: Mysterious backs and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked , and the plane-tree whispered to them in its own way above their heads .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 11]: Still , the Hundreds of people did not present themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 18]: Mr. Darnay presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree , but he was only One .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 11]: Doctor Manette received him kindly , and so did Lucie .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 22]: But , Miss Pross suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body , and retired into the house .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 27]: She was not unfrequently the victim of this disorder , and she called it , in familiar conversation , `` a fit of the jerks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 13]: The Doctor was in his best condition , and looked specially young .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 48]: The resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times , and as they sat side by side , she leaning on his shoulder , and he resting his arm on the back of her chair , it was very agreeable to trace the likeness .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 16]: He had been talking all day , on many subjects , and with unusual vivacity .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 52]: `` Pray , Doctor Manette , '' said Mr. Darnay , as they sat under the plane-tree -- and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand , which happened to be the old buildings of London -- `` have you seen much of the Tower ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 12]: `` Lucie and I have been there ; but only casually .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 19]: We have seen enough of it , to know that it teems with interest ; little more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 43]: `` I have been there , as you remember , '' said Darnay , with a smile , though reddening a little angrily , `` in another character , and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 12]: They told me a curious thing when I was there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 6]: `` What was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 3]: Lucie asked .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 27]: `` In making some alterations , the workmen came upon an old dungeon , which had been , for many years , built up and forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 26]: Every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisoners -- dates , names , complaints , and prayers .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 32]: Upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall , one prisoner , who seemed to have gone to execution , had cut as his last work , three letters .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 17]: They were done with some very poor instrument , and hurriedly , with an unsteady hand .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 28]: At first , they were read as D. I. C. ; but , on being more carefully examined , the last letter was found to be G .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 26]: There was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials , and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 20]: At length , it was suggested that the letters were not initials , but the complete word , DiG .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 48]: The floor was examined very carefully under the inscription , and , in the earth beneath a stone , or tile , or some fragment of paving , were found the ashes of a paper , mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 29]: What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read , but he had written something , and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler . ''
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 14]: `` My father , '' exclaimed Lucie , `` you are ill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 13]: He had suddenly started up , with his hand to his head .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 10]: His manner and his look quite terrified them all .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 9]: `` No , my dear , not ill .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 14]: There are large drops of rain falling , and they made me start .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 7]: We had better go in . ''
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 6]: He recovered himself almost instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 21]: Rain was really falling in large drops , and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 75]: But , he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told of , and , as they went into the house , the business eye of Mr. Lorry either detected , or fancied it detected , on his face , as it turned towards Charles Darnay , the same singular look that had been upon it when it turned towards him in the passages of the Court House .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 18]: He recovered himself so quickly , however , that Mr. Lorry had doubts of his business eye .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 51]: The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more steady than he was , when he stopped under it to remark to them that he was not yet proof against slight surprises -LRB- if he ever would be -RRB- , and that the rain had startled him .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 24]: Tea-time , and Miss Pross making tea , with another fit of the jerks upon her , and yet no Hundreds of people .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 12]: Mr. Carton had lounged in , but he made only Two .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 23]: The night was so very sultry , that although they sat with doors and windows open , they were overpowered by heat .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 24]: When the tea-table was done with , they all moved to one of the windows , and looked out into the heavy twilight .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 17]: Lucie sat by her father ; Darnay sat beside her ; Carton leaned against a window .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 32]: The curtains were long and white , and some of the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner , caught them up to the ceiling , and waved them like spectral wings .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 19]: `` The rain-drops are still falling , large , heavy , and few , '' said Doctor Manette .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 6]: `` It comes slowly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 9]: `` It comes surely , '' said Carton .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 28]: They spoke low , as people watching and waiting mostly do ; as people in a dark room , watching and waiting for Lightning , always do .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 42]: There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke ; the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going , yet not a footstep was there .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 12]: `` A multitude of people , and yet a solitude ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 11]: said Darnay , when they had listened for a while .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 10]: `` Is it not impressive , Mr. Darnay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 3]: asked Lucie .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 44]: `` Sometimes , I have sat here of an evening , until I have fancied -- but even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night , when all is so black and solemn -- '' `` Let us shudder too .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 8]: We may know what it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 8]: `` It will seem nothing to you .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 20]: Such whims are only impressive as we originate them , I think ; they are not to be communicated .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 36]: I have sometimes sat alone here of an evening , listening , until I have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by-and-bye into our lives . ''
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 29]: `` There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives , if that be so , '' Sydney Carton struck in , in his moody way .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 16]: The footsteps were incessant , and the hurry of them became more and more rapid .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 57]: The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet ; some , as it seemed , under the windows ; some , as it seemed , in the room ; some coming , some going , some breaking off , some stopping altogether ; all in the distant streets , and not one within sight .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 26]: `` Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us , Miss Manette , or are we to divide them among us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 24]: `` I do n't know , Mr. Darnay ; I told you it was a foolish fancy , but you asked for it .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 38]: When I have yielded myself to it , I have been alone , and then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life , and my father 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 8]: `` I take them into mine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 3]: said Carton .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 10]: `` I ask no questions and make no stipulations .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 23]: There is a great crowd bearing down upon us , Miss Manette , and I see them -- by the Lightning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 22]: He added the last words , after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 7]: `` And I hear them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 10]: he added again , after a peal of thunder .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 13]: `` Here they come , fast , fierce , and furious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 26]: It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified , and it stopped him , for no voice could be heard in it .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 39]: A memorable storm of thunder and lightning broke with that sweep of water , and there was not a moment 's interval in crash , and fire , and rain , until after the moon rose at midnight .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 37]: The great bell of Saint Paul 's was striking one in the cleared air , when Mr. Lorry , escorted by Jerry , high-booted and bearing a lantern , set forth on his return-passage to Clerkenwell .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 40]: There were solitary patches of road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell , and Mr. Lorry , mindful of foot-pads , always retained Jerry for this service : though it was usually performed a good two hours earlier .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 8]: `` What a night it has been !
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 22]: Almost a night , Jerry , '' said Mr. Lorry , `` to bring the dead out of their graves . ''
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 27]: `` I never see the night myself , master -- nor yet I do n't expect to -- what would do that , '' answered Jerry .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 14]: `` Good night , Mr. Carton , '' said the man of business .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 7]: `` Good night , Mr. Darnay .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 12]: Shall we ever see such a night again , together ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 2]: Perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 21]: Perhaps , see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar , bearing down upon them , too .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 28]: VII Monseigneur in Town Monseigneur , one of the great lords in power at the Court , held his fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 28]: Monseigneur was in his inner room , his sanctuary of sanctuaries , the Holiest of Holiests to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 8]: Monseigneur was about to take his chocolate .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 54]: Monseigneur could swallow a great many things with ease , and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather rapidly swallowing France ; but , his morning 's chocolate could not so much as get into the throat of Monseigneur , without the aid of four strong men besides the Cook .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 51]: It took four men , all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration , and the Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket , emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur , to conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur 's lips .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 52]: One lacquey carried the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence ; a second , milled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function ; a third , presented the favoured napkin ; a fourth -LRB- he of the two gold watches -RRB- , poured the chocolate out .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 25]: It was impossible for Monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring Heavens .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 29]: Deep would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men ; he must have died of two .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 22]: Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night , where the Comedy and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 14]: Monseigneur was out at a little supper most nights , with fascinating company .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 39]: So polite and so impressible was Monseigneur , that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and state secrets , than the needs of all France .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 17]: A happy circumstance for France , as the like always is for all countries similarly favoured !
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 24]: -- always was for England -LRB- by way of example -RRB- , in the regretted days of the merry Stuart who sold it .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 52]: Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business , which was , to let everything go on in its own way ; of particular public business , Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his way -- tend to his own power and pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 24]: Of his pleasures , general and particular , Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea , that the world was made for them .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 36]: The text of his order -LRB- altered from the original by only a pronoun , which is not much -RRB- ran : `` The earth and the fulness thereof are mine , saith Monseigneur . ''
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 39]: Yet , Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into his affairs , both private and public ; and he had , as to both classes of affairs , allied himself perforce with a Farmer -- General .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 54]: As to finances public , because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them , and must consequently let them out to somebody who could ; as to finances private , because Farmer -- Generals were rich , and Monseigneur , after generations of great luxury and expense , was growing poor .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 48]: Hence Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent , while there was yet time to ward off the impending veil , the cheapest garment she could wear , and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer -- General , poor in family .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 61]: Which Farmer -- General , carrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on the top of it , was now among the company in the outer rooms , much prostrated before by mankind -- always excepting superior mankind of the blood of Monseigneur , who , his own wife included , looked down upon him with the loftiest contempt .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 9]: A sumptuous man was the Farmer -- General .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 22]: Thirty horses stood in his stables , twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls , six body-women waited on his wife .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 48]: As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and forage where he could , the Farmer -- General -- howsoever his matrimonial relations conduced to social morality -- was at least the greatest reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 109]: For , the rooms , though a beautiful scene to look at , and adorned with every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could achieve , were , in truth , not a sound business ; considered with any reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere -LRB- and not so far off , either , but that the watching towers of Notre Dame , almost equidistant from the two extremes , could see them both -RRB- , they would have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business -- if that could have been anybody 's business , at the house of Monseigneur .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 101]: Military officers destitute of military knowledge ; naval officers with no idea of a ship ; civil officers without a notion of affairs ; brazen ecclesiastics , of the worst world worldly , with sensual eyes , loose tongues , and looser lives ; all totally unfit for their several callings , all lying horribly in pretending to belong to them , but all nearly or remotely of the order of Monseigneur , and therefore foisted on all public employments from which anything was to be got ; these were to be told off by the score and the score .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 40]: People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the State , yet equally unconnected with anything that was real , or with lives passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end , were no less abundant .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 27]: Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies for imaginary disorders that never existed , smiled upon their courtly patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 54]: Projectors who had discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the State was touched , except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to root out a single sin , poured their distracting babble into any ears they could lay hold of , at the reception of Monseigneur .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 43]: Unbelieving Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words , and making card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with , talked with Unbelieving Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals , at this wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 50]: Exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding , which was at that remarkable time -- and has been since -- to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject of human interest , were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion , at the hotel of Monseigneur .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 66]: Such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris , that the spies among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur -- forming a goodly half of the polite company -- would have found it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife , who , in her manners and appearance , owned to being a Mother .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 40]: Indeed , except for the mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this world -- which does not go far towards the realisation of the name of mother -- there was no such thing known to the fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 25]: Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close , and brought them up , and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and supped as at twenty .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 13]: The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon Monseigneur .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 33]: In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional people who had had , for a few years , some vague misgiving in them that things in general were going rather wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 62]: As a promising way of setting them right , half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic sect of Convulsionists , and were even then considering within themselves whether they should foam , rage , roar , and turn cataleptic on the spot -- thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the Future , for Monseigneur 's guidance .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 88]: Besides these Dervishes , were other three who had rushed into another sect , which mended matters with a jargon about `` the Centre of Truth : '' holding that Man had got out of the Centre of Truth -- which did not need much demonstration -- but had not got out of the Circumference , and that he was to be kept from flying out of the Circumference , and was even to be shoved back into the Centre , by fasting and seeing of spirits .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 24]: Among these , accordingly , much discoursing with spirits went on -- and it did a world of good which never became manifest .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 20]: But , the comfort was , that all the company at the grand hotel of Monseigneur were perfectly dressed .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 23]: If the Day of Judgment had only been ascertained to be a dress day , everybody there would have been eternally correct .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 46]: Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair , such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended , such gallant swords to look at , and such delicate honour to the sense of smell , would surely keep anything going , for ever and ever .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 63]: The exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they languidly moved ; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells ; and what with that ringing , and with the rustle of silk and brocade and fine linen , there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and his devouring hunger far away .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 17]: Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all things in their places .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 14]: Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that was never to leave off .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 71]: From the Palace of the Tuileries , through Monseigneur and the whole Court , through the Chambers , the Tribunals of Justice , and all society -LRB- except the scarecrows -RRB- , the Fancy Ball descended to the Common Executioner : who , in pursuance of the charm , was required to officiate `` frizzled , powdered , in a gold-laced coat , pumps , and white silk stockings . ''
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 47]: At the gallows and the wheel -- the axe was a rarity -- Monsieur Paris , as it was the episcopal mode among his brother Professors of the provinces , Monsieur Orleans , and the rest , to call him , presided in this dainty dress .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 50]: And who among the company at Monseigneur 's reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our Lord , could possibly doubt , that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman , powdered , gold-laced , pumped , and white-silk stockinged , would see the very stars out !
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 31]: Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his chocolate , caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown open , and issued forth .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 17]: Then , what submission , what cringing and fawning , what servility , what abject humiliation !
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 35]: As to bowing down in body and spirit , nothing in that way was left for Heaven -- which may have been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never troubled it .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 42]: Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there , a whisper on one happy slave and a wave of the hand on another , Monseigneur affably passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of Truth .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 35]: There , Monseigneur turned , and came back again , and so in due course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate sprites , and was seen no more .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 25]: The show being over , the flutter in the air became quite a little storm , and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 38]: There was soon but one person left of all the crowd , and he , with his hat under his arm and his snuff-box in his hand , slowly passed among the mirrors on his way out .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 34]: `` I devote you , '' said this person , stopping at the last door on his way , and turning in the direction of the sanctuary , `` to the Devil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 26]: With that , he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the dust from his feet , and quietly walked downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 24]: He was a man of about sixty , handsomely dressed , haughty in manner , and with a face like a fine mask .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 20]: A face of a transparent paleness ; every feature in it clearly defined ; one set expression on it .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 18]: The nose , beautifully formed otherwise , was very slightly pinched at the top of each nostril .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 20]: In those two compressions , or dints , the only little change that the face ever showed , resided .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 39]: They persisted in changing colour sometimes , and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted by something like a faint pulsation ; then , they gave a look of treachery , and cruelty , to the whole countenance .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 60]: Examined with attention , its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the line of the mouth , and the lines of the orbits of the eyes , being much too horizontal and thin ; still , in the effect of the face made , it was a handsome face , and a remarkable one .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 17]: Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard , got into his carriage , and drove away .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 30]: Not many people had talked with him at the reception ; he had stood in a little space apart , and Monseigneur might have been warmer in his manner .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 30]: It appeared , under the circumstances , rather agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses , and often barely escaping from being run down .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 34]: His man drove as if he were charging an enemy , and the furious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face , or to the lips , of the master .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 44]: The complaint had sometimes made itself audible , even in that deaf city and dumb age , that , in the narrow streets without footways , the fierce patrician custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a barbarous manner .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 41]: But , few cared enough for that to think of it a second time , and , in this matter , as in all others , the common wretches were left to get out of their difficulties as they could .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 51]: With a wild rattle and clatter , and an inhuman abandonment of consideration not easy to be understood in these days , the carriage dashed through streets and swept round corners , with women screaming before it , and men clutching each other and clutching children out of its way .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 42]: At last , swooping at a street corner by a fountain , one of its wheels came to a sickening little jolt , and there was a loud cry from a number of voices , and the horses reared and plunged .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 32]: But for the latter inconvenience , the carriage probably would not have stopped ; carriages were often known to drive on , and leave their wounded behind , and why not ?
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 22]: But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry , and there were twenty hands at the horses ' bridles .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 7]: `` What has gone wrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 7]: said Monsieur , calmly looking out .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 47]: A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of the horses , and had laid it on the basement of the fountain , and was down in the mud and wet , howling over it like a wild animal .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 8]: `` Pardon , Monsieur the Marquis ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 14]: said a ragged and submissive man , `` it is a child . ''
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 9]: `` Why does he make that abominable noise ?
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 6]: Is it his child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 16]: `` Excuse me , Monsieur the Marquis -- it is a pity -- yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 26]: The fountain was a little removed ; for the street opened , where it was , into a space some ten or twelve yards square .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 31]: As the tall man suddenly got up from the ground , and came running at the carriage , Monsieur the Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 4]: `` Killed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 23]: shrieked the man , in wild desperation , extending both arms at their length above his head , and staring at him .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 4]: `` Dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 12]: The people closed round , and looked at Monsieur the Marquis .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 25]: There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness ; there was no visible menacing or anger .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 22]: Neither did the people say anything ; after the first cry , they had been silent , and they remained so .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 19]: The voice of the submissive man who had spoken , was flat and tame in its extreme submission .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 23]: Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes over them all , as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 6]: He took out his purse .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 25]: `` It is extraordinary to me , '' said he , `` that you people can not take care of yourselves and your children .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 14]: One or the other of you is for ever in the , way .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 12]: How do I know what injury you have done my horses .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 2]: See !
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 5]: Give him that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 32]: He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up , and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 16]: The tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry , `` Dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 18]: He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man , for whom the rest made way .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 38]: On seeing him , the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder , sobbing and crying , and pointing to the fountain , where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle , and moving gently about it .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 11]: They were as silent , however , as the men .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 15]: `` I know all , I know all , '' said the last comer .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 9]: `` Be a brave man , my Gaspard !
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 16]: It is better for the poor little plaything to die so , than to live .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 9]: It has died in a moment without pain .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 10]: Could it have lived an hour as happily ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 17]: `` You are a philosopher , you there , '' said the , Marquis , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 8]: `` How do they call you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 7]: `` They call me Defarge . ''
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 6]: `` Of what trade ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 10]: `` Monsieur the Marquis , vendor of wine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 30]: `` Pick up that , philosopher and vendor of wine , '' said the Marquis , throwing him another gold coin , `` and spend it as you will .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 9]: The horses there ; are they right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 74]: Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time , Monsieur the Marquis leaned back in his seat , and was just being driven away with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing , and had paid for it , and could afford to pay for it ; when his ease was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage , and ringing on its floor .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 4]: `` Hold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 5]: said Monsieur the Marquis .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 5]: `` Hold the horses !
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 5]: Who threw that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 52]: He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood , a moment before ; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on the pavement in that spot , and the figure that stood beside him was the figure of a dark stout woman , knitting .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 5]: `` You dogs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 40]: said the Marquis , but smoothly , and with an unchanged front , except as to the spots on his nose : `` I would ride over any of you very willingly , and exterminate you from the earth .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 28]: If I knew which rascal threw at the carriage , and if that brigand were sufficiently near it , he should be crushed under the wheels . ''
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 46]: So cowed was their condition , and so long and hard their experience of what such a man could do to them , within the law and beyond it , that not a voice , or a hand , or even an eye was raised .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 7]: Among the men , not one .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 18]: But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily , and looked the Marquis in the face .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 42]: It was not for his dignity to notice it ; his contemptuous eyes passed over her , and over all the other rats ; and he leaned back in his seat again , and gave the word `` Go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 58]: He was driven on , and other carriages came whirling by in quick succession ; the Minister , the State -- Projector , the Farmer -- General , the Doctor , the Lawyer , the Ecclesiastic , the Grand Opera , the Comedy , the whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow , came whirling by .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 46]: The rats had crept out of their holes to look on , and they remained looking on for hours ; soldiers and police often passing between them and the spectacle , and making a barrier behind which they slunk , and through which they peeped .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 70]: The father had long ago taken up his bundle and bidden himself away with it , when the women who had tended the bundle while it lay on the base of the fountain , sat there watching the running of the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball -- when the one woman who had stood conspicuous , knitting , still knitted on with the steadfastness of Fate .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 66]: The water of the fountain ran , the swift river ran , the day ran into evening , so much life in the city ran into death according to rule , time and tide waited for no man , the rats were sleeping close together in their dark holes again , the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper , all things ran their course .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 20]: VIII Monseigneur in the Country A beautiful landscape , with the corn bright in it , but not abundant .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 26]: Patches of poor rye where corn should have been , patches of poor peas and beans , patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 35]: On inanimate nature , as on the men and women who cultivated it , a prevalent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly -- a dejected disposition to give up , and wither away .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 29]: Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage -LRB- which might have been lighter -RRB- , conducted by four post-horses and two postilions , fagged up a steep hill .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 38]: A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was no impeachment of his high breeding ; it was not from within ; it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control -- the setting sun .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 23]: The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hill-top , that its occupant was steeped in crimson .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 21]: `` It will die out , '' said Monsieur the Marquis , glancing at his hands , `` directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 15]: In effect , the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 56]: When the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel , and the carriage slid down hill , with a cinderous smell , in a cloud of dust , the red glow departed quickly ; the sun and the Marquis going down together , there was no glow left when the drag was taken off .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 55]: But , there remained a broken country , bold and open , a little village at the bottom of the hill , a broad sweep and rise beyond it , a church-tower , a windmill , a forest for the chase , and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 27]: Round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on , the Marquis looked , with the air of one who was coming near home .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 34]: The village had its one poor street , with its poor brewery , poor tannery , poor tavern , poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses , poor fountain , all usual poor appointments .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 7]: It had its poor people too .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 51]: All its people were poor , and many of them were sitting at their doors , shredding spare onions and the like for supper , while many were at the fountain , washing leaves , and grasses , and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 69]: Expressive sips of what made them poor , were not wanting ; the tax for the state , the tax for the church , the tax for the lord , tax local and tax general , were to be paid here and to be paid there , according to solemn inscription in the little village , until the wonder was , that there was any village left unswallowed .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 11]: Few children were to be seen , and no dogs .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 48]: As to the men and women , their choice on earth was stated in the prospect -- Life on the lowest terms that could sustain it , down in the little village under the mill ; or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 51]: Heralded by a courier in advance , and by the cracking of his postilions ' whips , which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening air , as if he came attended by the Furies , Monsieur the Marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 18]: It was hard by the fountain , and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 50]: He looked at them , and saw in them , without knowing it , the slow sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure , that was to make the meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 56]: Monsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that drooped before him , as the like of himself had drooped before Monseigneur of the Court -- only the difference was , that these faces drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate -- when a grizzled mender of the roads joined the group .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 8]: `` Bring me hither that fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 7]: said the Marquis to the courier .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 31]: The fellow was brought , cap in hand , and the other fellows closed round to look and listen , in the manner of the people at the Paris fountain .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 9]: `` I passed you on the road ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 7]: `` Monseigneur , it is true .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 12]: I had the honour of being passed on the road . ''
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 17]: `` Coming up the hill , and at the top of the hill , both ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 8]: `` Monseigneur , it is true . ''
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 11]: `` What did you look at , so fixedly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 10]: `` Monseigneur , I looked at the man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 16]: He stooped a little , and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 10]: All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 6]: `` What man , pig ?
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 6]: And why look there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 18]: `` Pardon , Monseigneur ; he swung by the chain of the shoe -- the drag . ''
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 4]: demanded the traveller .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 7]: `` Monseigneur , the man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 9]: `` May the Devil carry away these idiots !
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 7]: How do you call the man ?
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 12]: You know all the men of this part of the country .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 5]: Who was he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 6]: `` Your clemency , Monseigneur !
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 10]: He was not of this part of the country .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 14]: Of all the days of my life , I never saw him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 6]: `` Swinging by the chain ?
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 5]: To be suffocated ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 15]: `` With your gracious permission , that was the wonder of it , Monseigneur .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 9]: His head hanging over -- like this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 41]: He turned himself sideways to the carriage , and leaned back , with his face thrown up to the sky , and his head hanging down ; then recovered himself , fumbled with his cap , and made a bow .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 7]: `` What was he like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 10]: `` Monseigneur , he was whiter than the miller .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 16]: All covered with dust , white as a spectre , tall as a spectre ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 28]: The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd ; but all eyes , without comparing notes with other eyes , looked at Monsieur the Marquis .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 13]: Perhaps , to observe whether he had any spectre on his conscience .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 41]: `` Truly , you did well , '' said the Marquis , felicitously sensible that such vermin were not to ruffle him , `` to see a thief accompanying my carriage , and not open that great mouth of yours .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 2]: Bah !
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 8]: Put him aside , Monsieur Gabelle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 42]: Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster , and some other taxing functionary united ; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this examination , and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an official manner .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 3]: `` Bah !
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 4]: Go aside ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 4]: said Monsieur Gabelle .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 28]: `` Lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village to-night , and be sure that his business is honest , Gabelle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 14]: `` Monseigneur , I am flattered to devote myself to your orders . ''
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 8]: `` Did he run away , fellow ?
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 7]: -- where is that Accursed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 22]: The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen particular friends , pointing out the chain with his blue cap .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 19]: Some half-dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out , and presented him breathless to Monsieur the Marquis .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 17]: `` Did the man run away , Dolt , when we stopped for the drag ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 22]: `` Monseigneur , he precipitated himself over the hill-side , head first , as a person plunges into the river . ''
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 7]: `` See to it , Gabelle .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 4]: Go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 50]: The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels , like sheep ; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones ; they had very little else to save , or they might not have been so fortunate .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 27]: The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond , was soon checked by the steepness of the hill .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 23]: Gradually , it subsided to a foot pace , swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 48]: The postilions , with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies , quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips ; the valet walked by the horses ; the courier was audible , trotting on ahead into the dun distance .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 66]: At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground , with a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it ; it was a poor figure in wood , done by some inexperienced rustic carver , but he had studied the figure from the life -- his own life , maybe -- for it was dreadfully spare and thin .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 27]: To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse , and was not at its worst , a woman was kneeling .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 22]: She turned her head as the carriage came up to her , rose quickly , and presented herself at the carriage-door .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 7]: `` It is you , Monseigneur !
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 6]: Monseigneur , a petition . ''
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 16]: With an exclamation of impatience , but with his unchangeable face , Monseigneur looked out .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 5]: `` How , then !
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 4]: Always petitions ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 3]: `` Monseigneur .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 8]: For the love of the great God !
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 7]: My husband , the forester . ''
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 9]: `` What of your husband , the forester ?
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 7]: Always the same with you people .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 7]: He can not pay something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 8]: `` He has paid all , Monseigneur .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 5]: He is dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 4]: He is quiet .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 8]: Can I restore him to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 7]: `` Alas , no , Monseigneur !
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 14]: But he lies yonder , under a little heap of poor grass . ''
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 14]: `` Monseigneur , there are so many little heaps of poor grass ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 6]: `` Again , well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 10]: She looked an old woman , but was young .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 54]: Her manner was one of passionate grief ; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy , and laid one of them on the carriage-door -- tenderly , caressingly , as if it had been a human breast , and could be expected to feel the appealing touch .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 6]: `` Monseigneur , hear me !
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 6]: Monseigneur , hear my petition !
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 21]: My husband died of want ; so many die of want ; so many more will die of want . ''
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 5]: `` Again , well ?
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 6]: Can I feed them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 15]: `` Monseigneur , the good God knows ; but I do n't ask it .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 29]: My petition is , that a morsel of stone or wood , with my husband 's name , may be placed over him to show where he lies .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 35]: Otherwise , the place will be quickly forgotten , it will never be found when I am dead of the same malady , I shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 18]: Monseigneur , they are so many , they increase so fast , there is so much want .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 2]: Monseigneur !
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 3]: Monseigneur ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 58]: The valet had put her away from the door , the carriage had broken into a brisk trot , the postilions had quickened the pace , she was left far behind , and Monseigneur , again escorted by the Furies , was rapidly diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and his chateau .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 75]: The sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him , and rose , as the rain falls , impartially , on the dusty , ragged , and toil-worn group at the fountain not far away ; to whom the mender of roads , with the aid of the blue cap without which he was nothing , still enlarged upon his man like a spectre , as long as they could bear it .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 52]: By degrees , as they could bear no more , they dropped off one by one , and lights twinkled in little casements ; which lights , as the casements darkened , and more stars came out , seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having been extinguished .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 52]: The shadow of a large high-roofed house , and of many over-hanging trees , was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time ; and the shadow was exchanged for the light of a flambeau , as his carriage stopped , and the great door of his chateau was opened to him .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 15]: `` Monsieur Charles , whom I expect ; is he arrived from England ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 7]: `` Monseigneur , not yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 44]: IX The Gorgon 's Head It was a heavy mass of building , that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis , with a large stone courtyard before it , and two stone sweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 34]: A stony business altogether , with heavy stone balustrades , and stone urns , and stone flowers , and stone faces of men , and stone heads of lions , in all directions .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 19]: As if the Gorgon 's head had surveyed it , when it was finished , two centuries ago .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 46]: Up the broad flight of shallow steps , Monsieur the Marquis , flambeau preceded , went from his carriage , sufficiently disturbing the darkness to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile of stable building away among the trees .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 44]: All else was so quiet , that the flambeau carried up the steps , and the other flambeau held at the great door , burnt as if they were in a close room of state , instead of being in the open night-air .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 54]: Other sound than the owl 's voice there was none , save the failing of a fountain into its stone basin ; for , it was one of those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together , and then heave a long low sigh , and hold their breath again .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 58]: The great door clanged behind him , and Monsieur the Marquis crossed a hall grim with certain old boar-spears , swords , and knives of the chase ; grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips , of which many a peasant , gone to his benefactor Death , had felt the weight when his lord was angry .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 37]: Avoiding the larger rooms , which were dark and made fast for the night , Monsieur the Marquis , with his flambeau-bearer going on before , went up the staircase to a door in a corridor .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 21]: This thrown open , admitted him to his own private apartment of three rooms : his bed-chamber and two others .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 38]: High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors , great dogs upon the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time , and all luxuries befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 49]: The fashion of the last Louis but one , of the line that was never to break -- the fourteenth Louis -- was conspicuous in their rich furniture ; but , it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old pages in the history of France .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 28]: A supper-table was laid for two , in the third of the rooms ; a round room , in one of the chateau 's four extinguisher-topped towers .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 40]: A small lofty room , with its window wide open , and the wooden jalousie-blinds closed , so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of black , alternating with their broad lines of stone colour .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 24]: `` My nephew , '' said the Marquis , glancing at the supper preparation ; `` they said he was not arrived . ''
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 13]: Nor was he ; but , he had been expected with Monseigneur .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 18]: It is not probable he will arrive to-night ; nevertheless , leave the table as it is .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 12]: I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 21]: In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready , and sat down alone to his sumptuous and choice supper .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 32]: His chair was opposite to the window , and he had taken his soup , and was raising his glass of Bordeaux to his lips , when he put it down .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 6]: `` What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 17]: he calmly asked , looking with attention at the horizontal lines of black and stone colour .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 3]: `` Monseigneur ?
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 3]: That ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 5]: `` Outside the blinds .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 5]: Open the blinds . ''
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 4]: It was done .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 7]: `` Monseigneur , it is nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 12]: The trees and the night are all that are here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 32]: The servant who spoke , had thrown the blinds wide , had looked out into the vacant darkness , and stood with that blank behind him , looking round for instructions .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 9]: `` Good , '' said the imperturbable master .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 6]: `` Close them again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 14]: That was done too , and the Marquis went on with his supper .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 24]: He was half way through it , when he again stopped with his glass in his hand , hearing the sound of wheels .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 15]: It came on briskly , and came up to the front of the chateau .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 7]: `` Ask who is arrived . ''
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 7]: It was the nephew of Monseigneur .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 14]: He had been some few leagues behind Monseigneur , early in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 21]: He had diminished the distance rapidly , but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 15]: He had heard of Monseigneur , at the posting-houses , as being before him .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 27]: He was to be told -LRB- said Monseigneur -RRB- that supper awaited him then and there , and that he was prayed to come to it .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 7]: In a little while he came .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 10]: He had been known in England as Charles Darnay .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 15]: Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner , but they did not shake hands .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 9]: `` You left Paris yesterday , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 13]: he said to Monseigneur , as he took his seat at table .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 3]: `` Yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 4]: And you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 6]: `` I come direct . ''
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 5]: `` From London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 18]: `` You have been a long time coming , '' said the Marquis , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 10]: `` On the contrary ; I come direct . ''
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 4]: `` Pardon me !
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 19]: I mean , not a long time on the journey ; a long time intending the journey . ''
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 22]: `` I have been detained by '' -- the nephew stopped a moment in his answer -- `` various business . ''
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 10]: `` Without doubt , '' said the polished uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 15]: So long as a servant was present , no other words passed between them .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 36]: When coffee had been served and they were alone together , the nephew , looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a fine mask , opened a conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 20]: `` I have come back , sir , as you anticipate , pursuing the object that took me away .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 33]: It carried me into great and unexpected peril ; but it is a sacred object , and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have sustained me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 22]: `` Not to death , '' said the uncle ; `` it is not necessary to say , to death . ''
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 36]: `` I doubt , sir , '' returned the nephew , `` whether , if it had carried me to the utmost brink of death , you would have cared to stop me there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 51]: The deepened marks in the nose , and the lengthening of the fine straight lines in the cruel face , looked ominous as to that ; the uncle made a graceful gesture of protest , which was so clearly a slight form of good breeding that it was not reassuring .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 36]: `` Indeed , sir , '' pursued the nephew , `` for anything I know , you may have expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious circumstances that surrounded me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 14]: `` No , no , no , '' said the uncle , pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 43]: `` But , however that may be , '' resumed the nephew , glancing at him with deep distrust , `` I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means , and would know no scruple as to means . ''
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 23]: `` My friend , I told you so , '' said the uncle , with a fine pulsation in the two marks .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 17]: `` Do me the favour to recall that I told you so , long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 6]: `` I recall it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 13]: `` Thank you , '' said the Marquise -- very sweetly indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 16]: His tone lingered in the air , almost like the tone of a musical instrument .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 41]: `` In effect , sir , '' pursued the nephew , `` I believe it to be at once your bad fortune , and my good fortune , that has kept me out of a prison in France here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 16]: `` I do not quite understand , '' returned the uncle , sipping his coffee .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 9]: `` Dare I ask you to explain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 40]: `` I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court , and had not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past , a letter de cachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely . ''
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 14]: `` It is possible , '' said the uncle , with great calmness .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 19]: `` For the honour of the family , I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 5]: Pray excuse me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 30]: `` I perceive that , happily for me , the Reception of the day before yesterday was , as usual , a cold one , '' observed the nephew .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 28]: `` I would not say happily , my friend , '' returned the uncle , with refined politeness ; `` I would not be sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 28]: A good opportunity for consideration , surrounded by the advantages of solitude , might influence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 9]: But it is useless to discuss the question .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 11]: I am , as you say , at a disadvantage .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 37]: These little instruments of correction , these gentle aids to the power and honour of families , these slight favours that might so incommode you , are only to be obtained now by interest and importunity .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 18]: They are sought by so many , and they are granted -LRB- comparatively -RRB- to so few !
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 19]: It used not to be so , but France in all such things is changed for the worse .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 16]: Our not remote ancestors held the right of life and death over the surrounding vulgar .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 48]: From this room , many such dogs have been taken out to be hanged ; in the next room -LRB- my bedroom -RRB- , one fellow , to our knowledge , was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter -- HIS daughter ?
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 46]: We have lost many privileges ; a new philosophy has become the mode ; and the assertion of our station , in these days , might -LRB- I do not go so far as to say would , but might -RRB- cause us real inconvenience .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 8]: All very bad , very bad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 36]: The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff , and shook his head ; as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still containing himself , that great means of regeneration .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 44]: `` We have so asserted our station , both in the old time and in the modern time also , '' said the nephew , gloomily , `` that I believe our name to be more detested than any name in France . ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 11]: `` Let us hope so , '' said the uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 14]: `` Detestation of the high is the involuntary homage of the low . ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 50]: `` There is not , '' pursued the nephew , in his former tone , `` a face I can look at , in all this country round about us , which looks at me with any deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery . ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 30]: `` A compliment , '' said the Marquis , `` to the grandeur of the family , merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 3]: Hah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 16]: And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff , and lightly crossed his legs .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 53]: But , when his nephew , leaning an elbow on the table , covered his eyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand , the fine mask looked at him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness , closeness , and dislike , than was comportable with its wearer 's assumption of indifference .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 8]: `` Repression is the only lasting philosophy .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 45]: The dark deference of fear and slavery , my friend , '' observed the Marquis , `` will keep the dogs obedient to the whip , as long as this roof , '' looking up to it , `` shuts out the sky . ''
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 11]: That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 63]: If a picture of the chateau as it was to be a very few years hence , and of fifty like it as they too were to be a very few years hence , could have been shown to him that night , he might have been at a loss to claim his own from the ghastly , fire-charred , plunder-wrecked rains .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 50]: As for the roof he vaunted , he might have found THAT shutting out the sky in a new way -- to wit , for ever , from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead was fired , out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 25]: `` Meanwhile , '' said the Marquis , `` I will preserve the honour and repose of the family , if you will not .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 6]: But you must be fatigued .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 10]: Shall we terminate our conference for the night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 6]: `` A moment more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 9]: `` An hour , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 23]: `` Sir , '' said the nephew , `` we have done wrong , and are reaping the fruits of wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 7]: `` WE have done wrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 22]: repeated the Marquis , with an inquiring smile , and delicately pointing , first to his nephew , then to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 25]: `` Our family ; our honourable family , whose honour is of so much account to both of us , in such different ways .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 30]: Even in my father 's time , we did a world of wrong , injuring every human creature who came between us and our pleasure , whatever it was .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 16]: Why need I speak of my father 's time , when it is equally yours ?
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 19]: Can I separate my father 's twin-brother , joint inheritor , and next successor , from himself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 7]: `` Death has done that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 4]: said the Marquis .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 77]: `` And has left me , '' answered the nephew , `` bound to a system that is frightful to me , responsible for it , but powerless in it ; seeking to execute the last request of my dear mother 's lips , and obey the last look of my dear mother 's eyes , which implored me to have mercy and to redress ; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain . ''
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 45]: `` Seeking them from me , my nephew , '' said the Marquis , touching him on the breast with his forefinger -- they were now standing by the hearth -- `` you will for ever seek them in vain , be assured . ''
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 37]: Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face , was cruelly , craftily , and closely compressed , while he stood looking quietly at his nephew , with his snuff-box in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 57]: Once again he touched him on the breast , as though his finger were the fine point of a small sword , with which , in delicate finesse , he ran him through the body , and said , `` My friend , I will die , perpetuating the system under which I have lived . ''
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 22]: When he had said it , he took a culminating pinch of snuff , and put his box in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 29]: `` Better to be a rational creature , '' he added then , after ringing a small bell on the table , `` and accept your natural destiny .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 12]: But you are lost , Monsieur Charles , I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 23]: `` This property and France are lost to me , '' said the nephew , sadly ; `` I renounce them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 8]: `` Are they both yours to renounce ?
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 9]: France may be , but is the property ?
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 13]: It is scarcely worth mentioning ; but , is it yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 17]: `` I had no intention , in the words I used , to claim it yet .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 25]: If it passed to me from you , to-morrow -- '' `` Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 30]: -- or twenty years hence -- '' `` You do me too much honour , '' said the Marquis ; `` still , I prefer that supposition . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 12]: -- I would abandon it , and live otherwise and elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 6]: It is little to relinquish .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 12]: What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 4]: `` Hah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 10]: said the Marquis , glancing round the luxurious room .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 52]: `` To the eye it is fair enough , here ; but seen in its integrity , under the sky , and by the daylight , it is a crumbling tower of waste , mismanagement , extortion , debt , mortgage , oppression , hunger , nakedness , and suffering . ''
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 4]: `` Hah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 10]: said the Marquis again , in a well-satisfied manner .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 75]: `` If it ever becomes mine , it shall be put into some hands better qualified to free it slowly -LRB- if such a thing is possible -RRB- from the weight that drags it down , so that the miserable people who can not leave it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance , may , in another generation , suffer less ; but it is not for me .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 14]: There is a curse on it , and on all this land . ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 5]: `` And you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 4]: said the uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 19]: `` Forgive my curiosity ; do you , under your new philosophy , graciously intend to live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 29]: `` I must do , to live , what others of my countrymen , even with nobility at their backs , may have to do some day-work . ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 8]: `` In England , for example ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 14]: The family honour , sir , is safe from me in this country .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 20]: The family name can suffer from me in no other , for I bear it in no other . ''
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 14]: The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be lighted .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 11]: It now shone brightly , through the door of communication .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 16]: The Marquis looked that way , and listened for the retreating step of his valet .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 32]: `` England is very attractive to you , seeing how indifferently you have prospered there , '' he observed then , turning his calm face to his nephew with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 24]: `` I have already said , that for my prospering there , I am sensible I may be indebted to you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 10]: For the rest , it is my Refuge . ''
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 16]: `` They say , those boastful English , that it is the Refuge of many .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 11]: You know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there ?
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 4]: A Doctor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 6]: `` With a daughter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' said the Marquis .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 5]: `` You are fatigued .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 4]: Good night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 42]: As he bent his head in his most courtly manner , there was a secrecy in his smiling face , and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words , which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 38]: At the same time , the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes , and the thin straight lips , and the markings in the nose , curved with a sarcasm that looked handsomely diabolic .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' repeated the Marquis .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 7]: `` A Doctor with a daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 6]: So commences the new philosophy !
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 4]: You are fatigued .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 4]: Good night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 24]: It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 16]: The nephew looked at him , in vain , in passing on to the door .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 5]: `` Good night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 4]: said the uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 14]: `` I look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 3]: Good repose !
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 9]: Light Monsieur my nephew to his chamber there !
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 37]: -- And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed , if you will , '' he added to himself , before he rang his little bell again , and summoned his valet to his own bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 30]: The valet come and gone , Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his loose chamber-robe , to prepare himself gently for sleep , that hot still night .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 54]: Rustling about the room , his softly-slippered feet making no noise on the floor , he moved like a refined tiger : -- looked like some enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort , in story , whose periodical change into tiger form was either just going off , or just coming on .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 83]: He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom , looking again at the scraps of the day 's journey that came unbidden into his mind ; the slow toil up the hill at sunset , the setting sun , the descent , the mill , the prison on the crag , the little village in the hollow , the peasants at the fountain , and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the chain under the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 36]: That fountain suggested the Paris fountain , the little bundle lying on the step , the women bending over it , and the tall man with his arms up , crying , `` Dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 20]: `` I am cool now , '' said Monsieur the Marquis , `` and may go to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 40]: So , leaving only one light burning on the large hearth , he let his thin gauze curtains fall around him , and heard the night break its silence with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 60]: The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night for three heavy hours ; for three heavy hours , the horses in the stables rattled at their racks , the dogs barked , and the owl made a noise with very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to the owl by men-poets .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 20]: But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures hardly ever to say what is set down for them .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 22]: For three heavy hours , the stone faces of the chateau , lion and human , stared blindly at the night .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 23]: Dead darkness lay on all the landscape , dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 39]: The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass were undistinguishable from one another ; the figure on the Cross might have come down , for anything that could be seen of it .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 11]: In the village , taxers and taxed were fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 41]: Dreaming , perhaps , of banquets , as the starved usually do , and of ease and rest , as the driven slave and the yoked ox may , its lean inhabitants slept soundly , and were fed and freed .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 42]: The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard , and the fountain at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard -- both melting away , like the minutes that were falling from the spring of Time -- through three dark hours .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 28]: Then , the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light , and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 25]: Lighter and lighter , until at last the sun touched the tops of the still trees , and poured its radiance over the hill .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 22]: In the glow , the water of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood , and the stone faces crimsoned .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 40]: The carol of the birds was loud and high , and , on the weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur the Marquis , one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 24]: At this , the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed , and , with open mouth and dropped under-jaw , looked awe-stricken .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 15]: Now , the sun was full up , and movement began in the village .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 26]: Casement windows opened , crazy doors were unbarred , and people came forth shivering -- chilled , as yet , by the new sweet air .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 14]: Then began the rarely lightened toil of the day among the village population .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 53]: Some , to the fountain ; some , to the fields ; men and women here , to dig and delve ; men and women there , to see to the poor live stock , and lead the bony cows out , to such pasture as could be found by the roadside .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 35]: In the church and at the Cross , a kneeling figure or two ; attendant on the latter prayers , the led cow , trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its foot .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 16]: The chateau awoke later , as became its quality , but awoke gradually and surely .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 77]: First , the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been reddened as of old ; then , had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine ; now , doors and windows were thrown open , horses in their stables looked round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at doorways , leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows , dogs pulled hard at their chains , and reared impatient to be loosed .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 17]: All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life , and the return of morning .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 52]: Surely , not so the ringing of the great bell of the chateau , nor the running up and down the stairs ; nor the hurried figures on the terrace ; nor the booting and tramping here and there and everywhere , nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away ?
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 55]: What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads , already at work on the hill-top beyond the village , with his day 's dinner -LRB- not much to carry -RRB- lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow 's while to peck at , on a heap of stones ?
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 23]: Had the birds , carrying some grains of it to a distance , dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds ?
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 39]: Whether or no , the mender of roads ran , on the sultry morning , as if for his life , down the hill , knee-high in dust , and never stopped till he got to the fountain .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 33]: All the people of the village were at the fountain , standing about in their depressed manner , and whispering low , but showing no other emotions than grim curiosity and surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 44]: The led cows , hastily brought in and tethered to anything that would hold them , were looking stupidly on , or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their trouble , which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 51]: Some of the people of the chateau , and some of those of the posting-house , and all the taxing authorities , were armed more or less , and were crowded on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way , that was highly fraught with nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 31]: Already , the mender of roads had penetrated into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends , and was smiting himself in the breast with his blue cap .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 52]: What did all this portend , and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind a servant on horseback , and the conveying away of the said Gabelle -LRB- double-laden though the horse was -RRB- , at a gallop , like a new version of the German ballad of Leonora ?
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 16]: It portended that there was one stone face too many , up at the chateau .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 34]: The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night , and had added the one stone face wanting ; the stone face for which it had waited through about two hundred years .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 11]: It lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 16]: It was like a fine mask , suddenly startled , made angry , and petrified .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 17]: Driven home into the heart of the stone figure attached to it , was a knife .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 22]: Round its hilt was a frill of paper , on which was scrawled : `` Drive him fast to his tomb .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 6]: This , from Jacques . ''
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 40]: X Two Promises More months , to the number of twelve , had come and gone , and Mr. Charles Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French language who was conversant with French literature .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 20]: In this age , he would have been a Professor ; in that age , he was a Tutor .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 38]: He read with young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a living tongue spoken all over the world , and he cultivated a taste for its stores of knowledge and fancy .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 19]: He could write of them , besides , in sound English , and render them into sound English .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 48]: Such masters were not at that time easily found ; Princes that had been , and Kings that were to be , were not yet of the Teacher class , and no ruined nobility had dropped out of Tellson 's ledgers , to turn cooks and carpenters .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 41]: As a tutor , whose attainments made the student 's way unusually pleasant and profitable , and as an elegant translator who brought something to his work besides mere dictionary knowledge , young Mr. Darnay soon became known and encouraged .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 21]: He was well acquainted , more-over , with the circumstances of his country , and those were of ever-growing interest .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 12]: So , with great perseverance and untiring industry , he prospered .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 37]: In London , he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold , nor to lie on beds of roses ; if he had had any such exalted expectation , he would not have prospered .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 20]: He had expected labour , and he found it , and did it and made the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 7]: In this , his prosperity consisted .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 41]: A certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge , where he read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a contraband trade in European languages , instead of conveying Greek and Latin through the Custom-house .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 10]: The rest of his time he passed in London .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 50]: Now , from the days when it was always summer in Eden , to these days when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes , the world of a man has invariably gone one way -- Charles Darnay 's way -- the way of the love of a woman .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 12]: He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 50]: He had never heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice ; he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful , as hers when it was confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for him .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 79]: But , he had not yet spoken to her on the subject ; the assassination at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long , tong , dusty roads -- the solid stone chateau which had itself become the mere mist of a dream -- had been done a year , and he had never yet , by so much as a single spoken word , disclosed to her the state of his heart .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 13]: That he had his reasons for this , he knew full well .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 39]: It was again a summer day when , lately arrived in London from his college occupation , he turned into the quiet corner in Soho , bent on seeking an opportunity of opening his mind to Doctor Manette .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 20]: It was the close of the summer day , and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 12]: He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 24]: The energy which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated their sharpness , had been gradually restored to him .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 24]: He was now a very energetic man indeed , with great firmness of purpose , strength of resolution , and vigour of action .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 45]: In his recovered energy he was sometimes a little fitful and sudden , as he had at first been in the exercise of his other recovered faculties ; but , this had never been frequently observable , and had grown more and more rare .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 21]: He studied much , slept little , sustained a great deal of fatigue with ease , and was equably cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 23]: To him , now entered Charles Darnay , at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 4]: `` Charles Darnay !
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 6]: I rejoice to see you .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 14]: We have been counting on your return these three or four days past .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 22]: Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday , and both made you out to be more than due . ''
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 32]: `` I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter , '' he answered , a little coldly as to them , though very warmly as to the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 28]: `` Miss Manette -- '' `` Is well , '' said the Doctor , as he stopped short , `` and your return will delight us all .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 16]: She has gone out on some household matters , but will soon be home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 11]: `` Doctor Manette , I knew she was from home .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 18]: I took the opportunity of her being from home , to beg to speak to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 6]: There was a blank silence .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 8]: said the Doctor , with evident constraint .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 11]: `` Bring your chair here , and speak on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 17]: He complied as to the chair , but appeared to find the speaking on less easy .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 62]: `` I have had the happiness , Doctor Manette , of being so intimate here , '' so he at length began , `` for some year and a half , that I hope the topic on which I am about to touch may not -- '' He was stayed by the Doctor 's putting out his hand to stop him .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 24]: When he had kept it so a little while , he said , drawing it back : `` Is Lucie the topic ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 5]: `` She is . ''
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 14]: `` It is hard for me to speak of her at any time .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 21]: It is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours , Charles Darnay . ''
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 20]: `` It is a tone of fervent admiration , true homage , and deep love , Doctor Manette ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 4]: he said deferentially .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 15]: There was another blank silence before her father rejoined : `` I believe it .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 10]: I do you justice ; I believe it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 30]: His constraint was so manifest , and it was so manifest , too , that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject , that Charles Darnay hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 9]: `` Shall I go on , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 3]: Another blank .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 7]: `` Yes , go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 46]: `` You anticipate what I would say , though you can not know how earnestly I say it , how earnestly I feel it , without knowing my secret heart , and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 16]: Dear Doctor Manette , I love your daughter fondly , dearly , disinterestedly , devotedly .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 13]: If ever there were love in the world , I love her .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 14]: You have loved yourself ; let your old love speak for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 17]: The Doctor sat with his face turned away , and his eyes bent on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 23]: At the last words , he stretched out his hand again , hurriedly , and cried : `` Not that , sir !
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 4]: Let that be !
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 10]: I adjure you , do not recall that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 25]: His cry was so like a cry of actual pain , that it rang in Charles Darnay 's ears long after he had ceased .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 21]: He motioned with the hand he had extended , and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 10]: The latter so received it , and remained silent .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 20]: `` I ask your pardon , '' said the Doctor , in a subdued tone , after some moments .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 17]: `` I do not doubt your loving Lucie ; you may be satisfied of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 20]: He turned towards him in his chair , but did not look at him , or raise his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 23]: His chin dropped upon his hand , and his white hair overshadowed his face : `` Have you spoken to Lucie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 5]: `` Nor written ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 4]: `` Never . ''
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 24]: `` It would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is to be referred to your consideration for her father .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 5]: Her father thanks you .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 14]: He offered his hand ; but his eyes did not go with it .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 77]: `` I know , '' said Darnay , respectfully , `` how can I fail to know , Doctor Manette , I who have seen you together from day to day , that between you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual , so touching , so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured , that it can have few parallels , even in the tenderness between a father and child .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 49]: I know , Doctor Manette -- how can I fail to know -- that , mingled with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman , there is , in her heart , towards you , all the love and reliance of infancy itself .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 51]: I know that , as in her childhood she had no parent , so she is now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present years and character , united to the trustfulness and attachment of the early days in which you were lost to her .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 44]: I know perfectly well that if you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life , you could hardly be invested , in her sight , with a more sacred character than that in which you are always with her .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 29]: I know that when she is clinging to you , the hands of baby , girl , and woman , all in one , are round your neck .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 42]: I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her own age , sees and loves you at my age , loves her mother broken-hearted , loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 19]: I have known this , night and day , since I have known you in your home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 11]: Her father sat silent , with his face bent down .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 16]: His breathing was a little quickened ; but he repressed all other signs of agitation .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 42]: `` Dear Doctor Manette , always knowing this , always seeing her and you with this hallowed light about you , I have forborne , and forborne , as long as it was in the nature of man to do it .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 36]: I have felt , and do even now feel , that to bring my love -- even mine -- between you , is to touch your history with something not quite so good as itself .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 5]: But I love her .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 10]: Heaven is my witness that I love her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 12]: `` I believe it , '' answered her father , mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 8]: `` I have thought so before now .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 5]: I believe it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 72]: `` But , do not believe , '' said Darnay , upon whose ear the mournful voice struck with a reproachful sound , `` that if my fortune were so cast as that , being one day so happy as to make her my wife , I must at any time put any separation between her and you , I could or would breathe a word of what I now say .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 19]: Besides that I should know it to be hopeless , I should know it to be a baseness .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 50]: If I had any such possibility , even at a remote distance of years , harboured in my thoughts , and hidden in my heart -- if it ever had been there -- if it ever could be there -- I could not now touch this honoured hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 10]: He laid his own upon it as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 7]: `` No , dear Doctor Manette .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 68]: Like you , a voluntary exile from France ; like you , driven from it by its distractions , oppressions , and miseries ; like you , striving to live away from it by my own exertions , and trusting in a happier future ; I look only to sharing your fortunes , sharing your life and home , and being faithful to you to the death .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 39]: Not to divide with Lucie her privilege as your child , companion , and friend ; but to come in aid of it , and bind her closer to you , if such a thing can be . ''
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 10]: His touch still lingered on her father 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 37]: Answering the touch for a moment , but not coldly , her father rested his hands upon the arms of his chair , and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the conference .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 26]: A struggle was evidently in his face ; a struggle with that occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 32]: `` You speak so feelingly and so manfully , Charles Darnay , that I thank you with all my heart , and will open all my heart -- or nearly so .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 12]: Have you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 3]: `` None .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 6]: As yet , none . ''
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 23]: `` Is it the immediate object of this confidence , that you may at once ascertain that , with my knowledge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 5]: `` Not even so .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 26]: I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks ; I might -LRB- mistaken or not mistaken -RRB- have that hopefulness to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 10]: `` Do you seek any guidance from me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 7]: `` I ask none , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 28]: But I have thought it possible that you might have it in your power , if you should deem it right , to give me some . ''
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 10]: `` Do you seek any promise from me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 7]: `` I do seek that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 15]: `` I well understand that , without you , I could have no hope .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 44]: I well understand that , even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her innocent heart-do not think I have the presumption to assume so much -- I could retain no place in it against her love for her father . ''
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 22]: `` If that be so , do you see what , on the other hand , is involved in it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 26]: `` I understand equally well , that a word from her father in any suitor 's favour , would outweigh herself and all the world .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 29]: For which reason , Doctor Manette , '' said Darnay , modestly but firmly , `` I would not ask that word , to save my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 7]: `` I am sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 34]: Charles Darnay , mysteries arise out of close love , as well as out of wide division ; in the former case , they are subtle and delicate , and difficult to penetrate .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 29]: My daughter Lucie is , in this one respect , such a mystery to me ; I can make no guess at the state of her heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 24]: `` May I ask , sir , if you think she is -- '' As he hesitated , her father supplied the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 9]: `` Is sought by any other suitor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 10]: `` It is what I meant to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 19]: Her father considered a little before he answered : `` You have seen Mr. Carton here , yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 8]: Mr. Stryver is here too , occasionally .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 16]: If it be at all , it can only be by one of these . ''
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 8]: `` Or both , '' said Darnay .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 16]: `` I had not thought of both ; I should not think either , likely .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 7]: You want a promise from me .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 7]: Tell me what it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 50]: `` It is , that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time , on her own part , such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you , you will bear testimony to what I have said , and to your belief in it .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 21]: I hope you may be able to think so well of me , as to urge no influence against me .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 16]: I say nothing more of my stake in this ; this is what I ask .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 24]: The condition on which I ask it , and which you have an undoubted right to require , I will observe immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 16]: `` I give the promise , '' said the Doctor , `` without any condition .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 17]: I believe your object to be , purely and truthfully , as you have stated it .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 25]: I believe your intention is to perpetuate , and not to weaken , the ties between me and my other and far dearer self .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 22]: If she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness , I will give her to you .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 74]: If there were -- Charles Darnay , if there were -- '' The young man had taken his hand gratefully ; their hands were joined as the Doctor spoke : '' -- any fancies , any reasons , any apprehensions , anything whatsoever , new or old , against the man she really loved -- the direct responsibility thereof not lying on his head -- they should all be obliterated for her sake .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 24]: She is everything to me ; more to me than suffering , more to me than wrong , more to me -- Well !
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 6]: This is idle talk . ''
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 43]: So strange was the way in which he faded into silence , and so strange his fixed look when he had ceased to speak , that Darnay felt his own hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 17]: `` You said something to me , '' said Doctor Manette , breaking into a smile .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 10]: `` What was it you said to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 18]: He was at a loss how to answer , until he remembered having spoken of a condition .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 27]: Relieved as his mind reverted to that , he answered : `` Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my part .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 24]: My present name , though but slightly changed from my mother 's , is not , as you will remember , my own .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 17]: I wish to tell you what that is , and why I am in England . ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 4]: `` Stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 6]: said the Doctor of Beauvais .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 22]: `` I wish it , that I may the better deserve your confidence , and have no secret from you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 4]: `` Stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 30]: For an instant , the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears ; for another instant , even had his two hands laid on Darnay 's lips .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 11]: `` Tell me when I ask you , not now .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 21]: If your suit should prosper , if Lucie should love you , you shall tell me on your marriage morning .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 5]: Do you promise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 3]: `` Willingly .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 6]: `` Give me your hand .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 18]: She will be home directly , and it is better she should not see us together to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 2]: Go !
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 5]: God bless you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 46]: It was dark when Charles Darnay left him , and it was an hour later and darker when Lucie came home ; she hurried into the room alone -- for Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairs -- and was surprised to find his reading-chair empty .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 5]: `` My father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 5]: she called to him .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 5]: `` Father dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 17]: Nothing was said in answer , but she heard a low hammering sound in his bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 35]: Passing lightly across the intermediate room , she looked in at his door and came running back frightened , crying to herself , with her blood all chilled , `` What shall I do !
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 6]: What shall I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 23]: Her uncertainty lasted but a moment ; she hurried back , and tapped at his door , and softly called to him .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 30]: The noise ceased at the sound of her voice , and he presently came out to her , and they walked up and down together for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 17]: She came down from her bed , to look at him in his sleep that night .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 22]: He slept heavily , and his tray of shoemaking tools , and his old unfinished work , were all as usual .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 40]: XI A Companion Picture `` Sydney , '' said Mr. Stryver , on that self-same night , or morning , to his jackal ; `` mix another bowl of punch ; I have something to say to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 46]: Sydney had been working double tides that night , and the night before , and the night before that , and a good many nights in succession , making a grand clearance among Mr. Stryver 's papers before the setting in of the long vacation .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 41]: The clearance was effected at last ; the Stryver arrears were handsomely fetched up ; everything was got rid of until November should come with its fogs atmospheric , and fogs legal , and bring grist to the mill again .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 14]: Sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much application .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 62]: It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him through the night ; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded the towelling ; and he was in a very damaged condition , as he now pulled his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at intervals for the last six hours .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 11]: `` Are you mixing that other bowl of punch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 24]: said Stryver the portly , with his hands in his waistband , glancing round from the sofa where he lay on his back .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 5]: `` I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 6]: `` Now , look here !
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 32]: I am going to tell you something that will rather surprise you , and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as shrewd as you usually do think me .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 6]: I intend to marry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 5]: `` DO you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 5]: And not for money .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 7]: What do you say now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 10]: `` I do n't feel disposed to say much .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 5]: Who is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 4]: `` Guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 7]: `` Do I know her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 4]: `` Guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 25]: `` I am not going to guess , at five o'clock in the morning , with my brains frying and sputtering in my head .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 15]: if you want me to guess , you must ask me to dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 20]: `` Well then , I 'll tell you , '' said Stryver , coming slowly into a sitting posture .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 22]: `` Sydney , I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you , because you are such an insensible dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 27]: `` And you , '' returned Sydney , busy concocting the punch , `` are such a sensitive and poetical spirit -- '' `` Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 41]: rejoined Stryver , laughing boastfully , `` though I do n't prefer any claim to being the soul of Romance -LRB- for I hope I know better -RRB- , still I am a tenderer sort of fellow than YOU . ''
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 12]: `` You are a luckier , if you mean that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 7]: `` I do n't mean that .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 26]: I mean I am a man of more -- more -- '' `` Say gallantry , while you are about it , '' suggested Carton .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 5]: I 'll say gallantry .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 59]: My meaning is that I am a man , '' said Stryver , inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch , `` who cares more to be agreeable , who takes more pains to be agreeable , who knows better how to be agreeable , in a woman 's society , than you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 9]: `` Go on , '' said Sydney Carton .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 29]: `` No ; but before I go on , '' said Stryver , shaking his head in his bullying way , I 'll have this out with you .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 20]: You 've been at Doctor Manette 's house as much as I have , or more than I have .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 11]: Why , I have been ashamed of your moroseness there !
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 31]: Your manners have been of that silent and sullen and hangdog kind , that , upon my life and soul , I have been ashamed of you , Sydney ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 37]: `` It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar , to be ashamed of anything , '' returned Sydney ; `` you ought to be much obliged to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 58]: `` You shall not get off in that way , '' rejoined Stryver , shouldering the rejoinder at him ; `` no , Sydney , it 's my duty to tell you -- and I tell you to your face to do you good -- that you are a devilish ill-conditioned fellow in that sort of society .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 7]: You are a disagreeable fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 14]: Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made , and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 6]: `` Look at me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 25]: said Stryver , squaring himself ; `` I have less need to make myself agreeable than you have , being more independent in circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 7]: Why do I do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 13]: `` I never saw you do it yet , '' muttered Carton .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 15]: `` I do it because it 's politic ; I do it on principle .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 5]: And look at me !
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 5]: I get on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 32]: `` You do n't get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions , '' answered Carton , with a careless air ; `` I wish you would keep to that .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 14]: As to me -- will you never understand that I am incorrigible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 10]: He asked the question with some appearance of scorn .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 23]: `` You have no business to be incorrigible , '' was his friend 's answer , delivered in no very soothing tone .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 21]: `` I have no business to be , at all , that I know of , '' said Sydney Carton .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 7]: `` Who is the lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 62]: `` Now , do n't let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable , Sydney , '' said Mr. Stryver , preparing him with ostentatious friendliness for the disclosure he was about to make , `` because I know you do n't mean half you say ; and if you meant it all , it would be of no importance .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 20]: I make this little preface , because you once mentioned the young lady to me in slighting terms . ''
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 5]: `` I did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 9]: `` Certainly ; and in these chambers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 23]: Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend ; drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 13]: `` You made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 7]: The young lady is Miss Manette .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 40]: If you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or delicacy of feeling in that kind of way , Sydney , I might have been a little resentful of your employing such a designation ; but you are not .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 59]: You want that sense altogether ; therefore I am no more annoyed when I think of the expression , than I should be annoyed by a man 's opinion of a picture of mine , who had no eye for pictures : or of a piece of music of mine , who had no ear for music . ''
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 20]: Sydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate ; drank it by bumpers , looking at his friend .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 15]: `` Now you know all about it , Syd , '' said Mr. Stryver .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 38]: `` I do n't care about fortune : she is a charming creature , and I have made up my mind to please myself : on the whole , I think I can afford to please myself .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 43]: She will have in me a man already pretty well off , and a rapidly rising man , and a man of some distinction : it is a piece of good fortune for her , but she is worthy of good fortune .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 5]: Are you astonished ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 17]: Carton , still drinking the punch , rejoined , `` Why should I be astonished ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 5]: `` You approve ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 17]: Carton , still drinking the punch , rejoined , `` Why should I not approve ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 57]: said his friend Stryver , `` you take it more easily than I fancied you would , and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would be ; though , to be sure , you know well enough by this time that your ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 78]: Yes , Sydney , I have had enough of this style of life , with no other as a change from it ; I feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels inclined to go to it -LRB- when he does n't , he can stay away -RRB- , and I feel that Miss Manette will tell well in any station , and will always do me credit .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 8]: So I have made up my mind .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 20]: And now , Sydney , old boy , I want to say a word to YOU about YOUR prospects .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 18]: You are in a bad way , you know ; you really are in a bad way .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 38]: You do n't know the value of money , you live hard , you 'll knock up one of these days , and be ill and poor ; you really ought to think about a nurse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 25]: The prosperous patronage with which he said it , made him look twice as big as he was , and four times as offensive .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 20]: `` Now , let me recommend you , '' pursued Stryver , `` to look it in the face .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 26]: I have looked it in the face , in my different way ; look it in the face , you , in your different way .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 2]: Marry .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 8]: Provide somebody to take care of you .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 21]: Never mind your having no enjoyment of women 's society , nor understanding of it , nor tact for it .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 4]: Find out somebody .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 29]: Find out some respectable woman with a little property -- somebody in the landlady way , or lodging-letting way -- and marry her , against a rainy day .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 9]: That 's the kind of thing for YOU .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 8]: Now think of it , Sydney . ''
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 11]: `` I 'll think of it , '' said Sydney .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 42]: XII The Fellow of Delicacy Mr. Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good fortune on the Doctor 's daughter , resolved to make her happiness known to her before he left town for the Long Vacation .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 61]: After some mental debating of the point , he came to the conclusion that it would be as well to get all the preliminaries done with , and they could then arrange at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two before Michaelmas Term , or in the little Christmas vacation between it and Hilary .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 25]: As to the strength of his case , he had not a doubt about it , but clearly saw his way to the verdict .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 33]: Argued with the jury on substantial worldly grounds -- the only grounds ever worth taking into account -- it was a plain case , and had not a weak spot in it .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 35]: He called himself for the plaintiff , there was no getting over his evidence , the counsel for the defendant threw up his brief , and the jury did not even turn to consider .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 18]: After trying it , Stryver , C. J. , was satisfied that no plainer case could be .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 47]: Accordingly , Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens ; that failing , to Ranelagh ; that unaccountably failing too , it behoved him to present himself in Soho , and there declare his noble mind .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 28]: Towards Soho , therefore , Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from the Temple , while the bloom of the Long Vacation 's infancy was still upon it .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 49]: Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he was yet on Saint Dunstan 's side of Temple Bar , bursting in his full-blown way along the pavement , to the jostlement of all weaker people , might have seen how safe and strong he was .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 50]: His way taking him past Tellson 's , and he both banking at Tellson 's and knowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes , it entered Mr. Stryver 's mind to enter the bank , and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness of the Soho horizon .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 72]: So , he pushed open the door with the weak rattle in its throat , stumbled down the two steps , got past the two ancient cashiers , and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr. Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures , with perpendicular iron bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too , and everything under the clouds were a sum .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 4]: `` Halloa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 4]: said Mr. Stryver .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 6]: `` How do you do ?
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 7]: I hope you are well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 19]: It was Stryver 's grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any place , or space .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 32]: He was so much too big for Tellson 's , that old clerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance , as though he squeezed them against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 30]: The House itself , magnificently reading the paper quite in the far-off perspective , lowered displeased , as if the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 29]: The discreet Mr. Lorry said , in a sample tone of the voice he would recommend under the circumstances , `` How do you do , Mr. Stryver ?
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 8]: How do you do , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 4]: and shook hands .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 34]: There was a peculiarity in his manner of shaking hands , always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson 's who shook hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 16]: He shook in a self-abnegating way , as one who shook for Tellson and Co. .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 12]: `` Can I do anything for you , Mr. Stryver ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 9]: asked Mr. Lorry , in his business character .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 28]: `` Why , no , thank you ; this is a private visit to yourself , Mr. Lorry ; I have come for a private word . ''
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 5]: `` Oh indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 19]: said Mr. Lorry , bending down his ear , while his eye strayed to the House afar off .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 64]: `` I am going , '' said Mr. Stryver , leaning his arms confidentially on the desk : whereupon , although it was a large double one , there appeared to be not half desk enough for him : `` I am going to make an offer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend , Miss Manette , Mr. Lorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 6]: `` Oh dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 15]: cried Mr. Lorry , rubbing his chin , and looking at his visitor dubiously .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 8]: `` Oh dear me , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 6]: repeated Stryver , drawing back .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 7]: `` Oh dear you , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 10]: What may your meaning be , Mr. Lorry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 43]: `` My meaning , '' answered the man of business , `` is , of course , friendly and appreciative , and that it does you the greatest credit , and -- in short , my meaning is everything you could desire .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 53]: But -- really , you know , Mr. Stryver -- '' Mr. Lorry paused , and shook his head at him in the oddest manner , as if he were compelled against his will to add , internally , `` you know there really is so much too much of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 37]: said Stryver , slapping the desk with his contentious hand , opening his eyes wider , and taking a long breath , `` if I understand you , Mr. Lorry , I 'll be hanged ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 24]: Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that end , and bit the feather of a pen .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 10]: `` D -- n it all , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 14]: said Stryver , staring at him , `` am I not eligible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 5]: `` Oh dear yes !
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 8]: Oh yes , you 're eligible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 4]: said Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 11]: `` If you say eligible , you are eligible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 7]: `` Am I not prosperous ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 3]: asked Stryver .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 15]: if you come to prosperous , you are prosperous , '' said Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 5]: `` And advancing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 30]: `` If you come to advancing you know , '' said Mr. Lorry , delighted to be able to make another admission , `` nobody can doubt that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 13]: `` Then what on earth is your meaning , Mr. Lorry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 6]: demanded Stryver , perceptibly crestfallen .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 9]: I -- Were you going there now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 4]: asked Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 4]: `` Straight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 13]: said Stryver , with a plump of his fist on the desk .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 14]: `` Then I think I would n't , if I was you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 3]: said Stryver .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 19]: `` Now , I 'll put you in a corner , '' forensically shaking a forefinger at him .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 14]: `` You are a man of business and bound to have a reason .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 4]: State your reason .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 7]: Why would n't you go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 29]: `` Because , '' said Mr. Lorry , `` I would n't go on such an object without having some cause to believe that I should succeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 7]: `` D -- n ME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 10]: cried Stryver , `` but this beats everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 15]: Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House , and glanced at the angry Stryver .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 47]: `` Here 's a man of business -- a man of years -- a man of experience -- IN a Bank , '' said Stryver ; `` and having summed up three leading reasons for complete success , he says there 's no reason at all !
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 8]: Says it with his head on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 25]: Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 45]: `` When I speak of success , I speak of success with the young lady ; and when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable , I speak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 24]: The young lady , my good sir , '' said Mr. Lorry , mildly tapping the Stryver arm , `` the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 8]: The young lady goes before all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 40]: `` Then you mean to tell me , Mr. Lorry , '' said Stryver , squaring his elbows , `` that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at present in question is a mincing Fool ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 5]: `` Not exactly so .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 93]: I mean to tell you , Mr. Stryver , '' said Mr. Lorry , reddening , `` that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady from any lips ; and that if I knew any man -- which I hope I do not -- whose taste was so coarse , and whose temper was so overbearing , that he could not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at this desk , not even Tellson 's should prevent my giving him a piece of my mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 52]: The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver 's blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry ; Mr. Lorry 's veins , methodical as their courses could usually be , were in no better state now it was his turn .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 17]: `` That is what I mean to tell you , sir , '' said Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 11]: `` Pray let there be no mistake about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 33]: Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while , and then stood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it , which probably gave him the toothache .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 19]: He broke the awkward silence by saying : `` This is something new to me , Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 25]: You deliberately advise me not to go up to Soho and offer myself -- MYself , Stryver of the King 's Bench bar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 13]: `` Do you ask me for my advice , Mr. Stryver ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 7]: `` Yes , I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 4]: `` Very good .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 13]: Then I give it , and you have repeated it correctly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 26]: `` And all I can say of it is , '' laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh , `` that this -- ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 12]: -- beats everything past , present , and to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 10]: `` Now understand me , '' pursued Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 32]: `` As a man of business , I am not justified in saying anything about this matter , for , as a man of business , I know nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 44]: But , as an old fellow , who has carried Miss Manette in his arms , who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and of her father too , and who has a great affection for them both , I have spoken .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 10]: The confidence is not of my seeking , recollect .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 11]: Now , you think I may not be right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 5]: `` Not I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 5]: said Stryver , whistling .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 21]: `` I ca n't undertake to find third parties in common sense ; I can only find it for myself .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 13]: I suppose sense in certain quarters ; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 16]: It 's new to me , but you are right , I dare say . ''
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 52]: `` What I suppose , Mr. Stryver , I claim to characterise for myself -- And understand me , sir , '' said Mr. Lorry , quickly flushing again , `` I will not -- not even at Tellson 's -- have it characterised for me by any gentleman breathing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 6]: I beg your pardon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 3]: said Stryver .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 3]: `` Granted .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 58]: Well , Mr. Stryver , I was about to say : -- it might be painful to you to find yourself mistaken , it might be painful to Doctor Manette to have the task of being explicit with you , it might be very painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 18]: You know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with the family .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 40]: If you please , committing you in no way , representing you in no way , I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon it .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 51]: If you should then be dissatisfied with it , you can but test its soundness for yourself ; if , on the other hand , you should be satisfied with it , and it should be what it now is , it may spare all sides what is best spared .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 6]: What do you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 11]: `` How long would you keep me in town ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 10]: It is only a question of a few hours .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 17]: I could go to Soho in the evening , and come to your chambers afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 45]: `` Then I say yes , '' said Stryver : `` I wo n't go up there now , I am not so hot upon it as that comes to ; I say yes , and I shall expect you to look in to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 4]: Good morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 45]: Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank , causing such a concussion of air on his passage through , that to stand up against it bowing behind the two counters , required the utmost remaining strength of the two ancient clerks .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 46]: Those venerable and feeble persons were always seen by the public in the act of bowing , and were popularly believed , when they had bowed a customer out , still to keep on bowing in the empty office until they bowed another customer in .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 30]: The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than moral certainty .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 18]: Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to swallow , he got it down .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 42]: `` And now , '' said Mr. Stryver , shaking his forensic forefinger at the Temple in general , when it was down , `` my way out of this , is , to put you all in the wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 20]: It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician , in which he found great relief .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 27]: `` You shall not put me in the wrong , young lady , '' said Mr. Stryver ; `` I 'll do that for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 45]: Accordingly , when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o'clock , Mr. Stryver , among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the purpose , seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 20]: He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry , and was altogether in an absent and preoccupied state .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 20]: said that good-natured emissary , after a full half-hour of bootless attempts to bring him round to the question .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 8]: `` I have been to Soho . ''
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 5]: `` To Soho ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 6]: repeated Mr. Stryver , coldly .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 7]: `` Oh , to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 7]: What am I thinking of ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 23]: `` And I have no doubt , '' said Mr. Lorry , `` that I was right in the conversation we had .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 12]: My opinion is confirmed , and I reiterate my advice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 37]: `` I assure you , '' returned Mr. Stryver , in the friendliest way , `` that I am sorry for it on your account , and sorry for it on the poor father 's account .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 22]: I know this must always be a sore subject with the family ; let us say no more about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 12]: `` I do n't understand you , '' said Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 28]: `` I dare say not , '' rejoined Stryver , nodding his head in a smoothing and final way ; `` no matter , no matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 11]: `` But it does matter , '' Mr. Lorry urged .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 13]: `` No it does n't ; I assure you it does n't .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 38]: Having supposed that there was sense where there is no sense , and a laudable ambition where there is not a laudable ambition , I am well out of my mistake , and no harm is done .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 20]: Young women have committed similar follies often before , and have repented them in poverty and obscurity often before .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 76]: In an unselfish aspect , I am sorry that the thing is dropped , because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view ; in a selfish aspect , I am glad that the thing has dropped , because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view -- it is hardly necessary to say I could have gained nothing by it .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 8]: There is no harm at all done .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 35]: I have not proposed to the young lady , and , between ourselves , I am by no means certain , on reflection , that I ever should have committed myself to that extent .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 31]: Mr. Lorry , you can not control the mincing vanities and giddinesses of empty-headed girls ; you must not expect to do it , or you will always be disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 9]: Now , pray say no more about it .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 21]: I tell you , I regret it on account of others , but I am satisfied on my own account .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 44]: And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you , and for giving me your advice ; you know the young lady better than I do ; you were right , it never would have done . ''
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 38]: Mr. Lorry was so taken aback , that he looked quite stupidly at Mr. Stryver shouldering him towards the door , with an appearance of showering generosity , forbearance , and goodwill , on his erring head .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 36]: `` Make the best of it , my dear sir , '' said Stryver ; `` say no more about it ; thank you again for allowing me to sound you ; good night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 15]: Mr. Lorry was out in the night , before he knew where he was .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 14]: Mr. Stryver was lying back on his sofa , winking at his ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 24]: XIII The Fellow of No Delicacy If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere , he certainly never shone in the house of Doctor Manette .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 23]: He had been there often , during a whole year , and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 38]: When he cared to talk , he talked well ; but , the cloud of caring for nothing , which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness , was very rarely pierced by the light within him .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 24]: And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house , and for the senseless stones that made their pavements .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 80]: Many a night he vaguely and unhappily wandered there , when wine had brought no transitory gladness to him ; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary figure lingering there , and still lingering there when the first beams of the sun brought into strong relief , removed beauties of architecture in spires of churches and lofty buildings , as perhaps the quiet time brought some sense of better things , else forgotten and unattainable , into his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 45]: Of late , the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known him more scantily than ever ; and often when he had thrown himself upon it no longer than a few minutes , he had got up again , and haunted that neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 78]: On a day in August , when Mr. Stryver -LRB- after notifying to his jackal that `` he had thought better of that marrying matter '' -RRB- had carried his delicacy into Devonshire , and when the sight and scent of flowers in the City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst , of health for the sickliest , and of youth for the oldest , Sydney 's feet still trod those stones .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 33]: From being irresolute and purposeless , his feet became animated by an intention , and , in the working out of that intention , they took him to the Doctor 's door .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 14]: He was shown up-stairs , and found Lucie at her work , alone .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 26]: She had never been quite at her ease with him , and received him with some little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 23]: But , looking up at his face in the interchange of the first few common-places , she observed a change in it .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 12]: `` I fear you are not well , Mr. Carton ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 15]: But the life I lead , Miss Manette , is not conducive to health .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 14]: What is to be expected of , or by , such profligates ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 26]: `` Is it not -- forgive me ; I have begun the question on my lips -- a pity to live no better life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 9]: `` God knows it is a shame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 8]: `` Then why not change it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 21]: Looking gently at him again , she was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 20]: There were tears in his voice too , as he answered : `` It is too late for that .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 9]: I shall never be better than I am .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 10]: I shall sink lower , and be worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 16]: He leaned an elbow on her table , and covered his eyes with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 9]: The table trembled in the silence that followed .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 12]: She had never seen him softened , and was much distressed .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 23]: He knew her to be so , without looking at her , and said : `` Pray forgive me , Miss Manette .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 15]: I break down before the knowledge of what I want to say to you .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 6]: Will you hear me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 27]: `` If it will do you any good , Mr. Carton , if it would make you happier , it would make me very glad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 10]: `` God bless you for your sweet compassion ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 13]: He unshaded his face after a little while , and spoke steadily .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 9]: `` Do n't be afraid to hear me .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 8]: Do n't shrink from anything I say .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 8]: I am like one who died young .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 8]: All my life might have been . ''
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 6]: `` No , Mr. Carton .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 28]: I am sure that the best part of it might still be ; I am sure that you might be much , much worthier of yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 34]: `` Say of you , Miss Manette , and although I know better -- although in the mystery of my own wretched heart I know better -- I shall never forget it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 6]: She was pale and trembling .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 24]: He came to her relief with a fixed despair of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have been holden .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 86]: `` If it had been possible , Miss Manette , that you could have returned the love of the man you see before yourself -- flung away , wasted , drunken , poor creature of misuse as you know him to be -- he would have been conscious this day and hour , in spite of his happiness , that he would bring you to misery , bring you to sorrow and repentance , blight you , disgrace you , pull you down with him .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 29]: I know very well that you can have no tenderness for me ; I ask for none ; I am even thankful that it can not be . ''
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 13]: `` Without it , can I not save you , Mr. Carton ?
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 10]: Can I not recall you -- forgive me again !
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 6]: -- to a better course ?
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 9]: Can I in no way repay your confidence ?
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 34]: I know this is a confidence , '' she modestly said , after a little hesitation , and in earnest tears , `` I know you would say this to no one else .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 15]: Can I turn it to no good account for yourself , Mr. Carton ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 5]: He shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 4]: `` To none .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 8]: No , Miss Manette , to none .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 21]: If you will hear me through a very little more , all you can ever do for me is done .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 16]: I wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 43]: In my degradation I have not been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father , and of this home made such a home by you , has stirred old shadows that I thought had died out of me .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 40]: Since I knew you , I have been troubled by a remorse that I thought would never reproach me again , and have heard whispers from old voices impelling me upward , that I thought were silent for ever .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 25]: I have had unformed ideas of striving afresh , beginning anew , shaking off sloth and sensuality , and fighting out the abandoned fight .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 33]: A dream , all a dream , that ends in nothing , and leaves the sleeper where he lay down , but I wish you to know that you inspired it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 7]: `` Will nothing of it remain ?
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 7]: O Mr. Carton , think again !
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 4]: Try again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 19]: `` No , Miss Manette ; all through it , I have known myself to be quite undeserving .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 65]: And yet I have had the weakness , and have still the weakness , to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me , heap of ashes that I am , into fire -- a fire , however , inseparable in its nature from myself , quickening nothing , lighting nothing , doing no service , idly burning away . ''
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 45]: `` Since it is my misfortune , Mr. Carton , to have made you more unhappy than you were before you knew me -- '' `` Do n't say that , Miss Manette , for you would have reclaimed me , if anything could .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 12]: You will not be the cause of my becoming worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 46]: `` Since the state of your mind that you describe , is , at all events , attributable to some influence of mine -- this is what I mean , if I can make it plain -- can I use no influence to serve you ?
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 14]: Have I no power for good , with you , at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 21]: `` The utmost good that I am capable of now , Miss Manette , I have come here to realise .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 46]: Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life , the remembrance that I opened my heart to you , last of all the world ; and that there was something left in me at this time which you could deplore and pity . ''
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 30]: `` Which I entreated you to believe , again and again , most fervently , with all my heart , was capable of better things , Mr. Carton ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 12]: `` Entreat me to believe it no more , Miss Manette .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 10]: I have proved myself , and I know better .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 11]: I distress you ; I draw fast to an end .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 44]: Will you let me believe , when I recall this day , that the last confidence of my life was reposed in your pure and innocent breast , and that it lies there alone , and will be shared by no one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 13]: `` If that will be a consolation to you , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 15]: `` Not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 30]: `` Mr. Carton , '' she answered , after an agitated pause , `` the secret is yours , not mine ; and I promise to respect it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 8]: And again , God bless you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 14]: He put her hand to his lips , and moved towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 23]: `` Be under no apprehension , Miss Manette , of my ever resuming this conversation by so much as a passing word .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 8]: I will never refer to it again .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 15]: If I were dead , that could not be surer than it is henceforth .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 53]: In the hour of my death , I shall hold sacred the one good remembrance -- and shall thank and bless you for it -- that my last avowal of myself was made to you , and that my name , and faults , and miseries were gently carried in your heart .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 9]: May it otherwise be light and happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 53]: He was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be , and it was so sad to think how much he had thrown away , and how much he every day kept down and perverted , that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for him as he stood looking back at her .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 5]: `` Be comforted ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 14]: he said , `` I am not worth such feeling , Miss Manette .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 39]: An hour or two hence , and the low companions and low habits that I scorn but yield to , will render me less worth such tears as those , than any wretch who creeps along the streets .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 3]: Be comforted !
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 30]: But , within myself , I shall always be , towards you , what I am now , though outwardly I shall be what you have heretofore seen me .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 21]: The last supplication but one I make to you , is , that you will believe this of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 8]: `` I will , Mr. Carton . ''
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 43]: `` My last supplication of all , is this ; and with it , I will relieve you of a visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison , and between whom and you there is an impassable space .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 18]: It is useless to say it , I know , but it rises out of my soul .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 15]: For you , and for any dear to you , I would do anything .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 34]: If my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it , I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 22]: Try to hold me in your mind , at some quiet times , as ardent and sincere in this one thing .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 51]: The time will come , the time will not be long in coming , when new ties will be formed about you -- ties that will bind you yet more tenderly and strongly to the home you so adorn -- the dearest ties that will ever grace and gladden you .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 58]: O Miss Manette , when the little picture of a happy father 's face looks up in yours , when you see your own bright beauty springing up anew at your feet , think now and then that there is a man who would give his life , to keep a life you love beside you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 7]: He said , `` Farewell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 9]: said a last `` God bless you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 4]: and left her .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 39]: XIV The Honest Tradesman To the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher , sitting on his stool in Fleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him , a vast number and variety of objects in movement were every day presented .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 62]: Who could sit upon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day , and not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions , one ever tending westward with the sun , the other ever tending eastward from the sun , both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where the sun goes down !
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 43]: With his straw in his mouth , Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams , like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty watching one stream -- saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever running dry .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 53]: Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind , since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid women -LRB- mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life -RRB- from Tellson 's side of the tides to the opposite shore .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 38]: Brief as such companionship was in every separate instance , Mr. Cruncher never failed to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to have the honour of drinking her very good health .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 28]: And it was from the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent purpose , that he recruited his finances , as just now observed .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 23]: Time was , when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place , and mused in the sight of men .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 29]: Mr. Cruncher , sitting on a stool in a public place , but not being a poet , mused as little as possible , and looked about him .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 66]: It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were few , and belated women few , and when his affairs in general were so unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs. Cruncher must have been `` flopping '' in some pointed manner , when an unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward , attracted his attention .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 31]: Looking that way , Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of funeral was coming along , and that there was popular objection to this funeral , which engendered uproar .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 22]: `` Young Jerry , '' said Mr. Cruncher , turning to his offspring , `` it 's a buryin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 6]: `` Hooroar , father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 4]: cried Young Jerry .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 11]: The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 24]: The elder gentleman took the cry so ill , that he watched his opportunity , and smote the young gentleman on the ear .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 5]: `` What d'ye mean ?
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 6]: What are you hooroaring at ?
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 15]: What do you want to conwey to your own father , you young Rip ?
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 11]: This boy is a getting too many for ME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 7]: said Mr. Cruncher , surveying him .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 6]: `` Him and his hooroars !
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 19]: Do n't let me hear no more of you , or you shall feel some more of me .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 4]: D'ye hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 17]: `` I war n't doing no harm , '' Young Jerry protested , rubbing his cheek .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 21]: `` Drop it then , '' said Mr. Cruncher ; `` I wo n't have none of YOUR no harms .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 15]: Get a top of that there seat , and look at the crowd . ''
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 49]: His son obeyed , and the crowd approached ; they were bawling and hissing round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach , in which mourning coach there was only one mourner , dressed in the dingy trappings that were considered essential to the dignity of the position .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 38]: The position appeared by no means to please him , however , with an increasing rabble surrounding the coach , deriding him , making grimaces at him , and incessantly groaning and calling out : `` Yah !
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 2]: Spies !
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 2]: Tst !
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 2]: Yaha !
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 3]: Spies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 10]: with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 30]: Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher ; he always pricked up his senses , and became excited , when a funeral passed Tellson 's .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 33]: Naturally , therefore , a funeral with this uncommon attendance excited him greatly , and he asked of the first man who ran against him : `` What is it , brother ?
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 6]: What 's it about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 11]: `` I do n't know , '' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 3]: `` Spies !
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 2]: Yaha !
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 2]: Tst !
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 3]: Spies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 5]: He asked another man .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 6]: `` Who is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 34]: `` I do n't know , '' returned the man , clapping his hands to his mouth nevertheless , and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the greatest ardour , `` Spies !
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 2]: Yaha !
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 4]: Tst , tst !
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 5]: Spi -- ies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 35]: At length , a person better informed on the merits of the case , tumbled against him , and from this person he learned that the funeral was the funeral of one Roger Cly .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 7]: `` Was He a spy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 4]: asked Mr. Cruncher .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 10]: `` Old Bailey spy , '' returned his informant .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 3]: `` Yaha !
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 2]: Tst !
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 2]: Yah !
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 9]: Old Bailey Spi -- i -- ies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 8]: `` Why , to be sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 12]: exclaimed Jerry , recalling the Trial at which he had assisted .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 6]: `` I 've seen him .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 6]: Dead , is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 18]: `` Dead as mutton , '' returned the other , `` and ca n't be too dead .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 6]: Have 'em out , there !
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 2]: Spies !
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 6]: Pull 'em out , there !
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 3]: Spies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 51]: The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea , that the crowd caught it up with eagerness , and loudly repeating the suggestion to have 'em out , and to pull 'em out , mobbed the two vehicles so closely that they came to a stop .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 70]: On the crowd 's opening the coach doors , the one mourner scuffled out of himself and was in their hands for a moment ; but he was so alert , and made such good use of his time , that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street , after shedding his cloak , hat , long hatband , white pocket-handkerchief , and other symbolical tears .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 42]: These , the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great enjoyment , while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops ; for a crowd in those times stopped at nothing , and was a monster much dreaded .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 33]: They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin out , when some brighter genius proposed instead , its being escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 52]: Practical suggestions being much needed , this suggestion , too , was received with acclamation , and the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out , while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any exercise of ingenuity stick upon it .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 33]: Among the first of these volunteers was Jerry Cruncher himself , who modestly concealed his spiky head from the observation of Tellson 's , in the further corner of the mourning coach .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 48]: The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in the ceremonies ; but , the river being alarmingly near , and several voices remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory members of the profession to reason , the protest was faint and brief .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 49]: The remodelled procession started , with a chimney-sweep driving the hearse -- advised by the regular driver , who was perched beside him , under close inspection , for the purpose -- and with a pieman , also attended by his cabinet minister , driving the mourning coach .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 55]: A bear-leader , a popular street character of the time , was impressed as an additional ornament , before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand ; and his bear , who was black and very mangy , gave quite an Undertaking air to that part of the procession in which he walked .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 36]: Thus , with beer-drinking , pipe-smoking , song-roaring , and infinite caricaturing of woe , the disorderly procession went its way , recruiting at every step , and all the shops shutting up before it .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 16]: Its destination was the old church of Saint Pancras , far off in the fields .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 37]: It got there in course of time ; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground ; finally , accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way , and highly to its own satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 49]: The dead man disposed of , and the crowd being under the necessity of providing some other entertainment for itself , another brighter genius -LRB- or perhaps the same -RRB- conceived the humour of impeaching casual passers-by , as Old Bailey spies , and wreaking vengeance on them .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 36]: Chase was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near the Old Bailey in their lives , in the realisation of this fancy , and they were roughly hustled and maltreated .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 21]: The transition to the sport of window-breaking , and thence to the plundering of public-houses , was easy and natural .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 40]: At last , after several hours , when sundry summer-houses had been pulled down , and some area-railings had been torn up , to arm the more belligerent spirits , a rumour got about that the Guards were coming .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 32]: Before this rumour , the crowd gradually melted away , and perhaps the Guards came , and perhaps they never came , and this was the usual progress of a mob .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 26]: Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports , but had remained behind in the churchyard , to confer and condole with the undertakers .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 9]: The place had a soothing influence on him .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 24]: He procured a pipe from a neighbouring public-house , and smoked it , looking in at the railings and maturely considering the spot .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 46]: `` Jerry , '' said Mr. Cruncher , apostrophising himself in his usual way , `` you see that there Cly that day , and you see with your own eyes that he was a young ` un and a straight made ` un . ''
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 35]: Having smoked his pipe out , and ruminated a little longer , he turned himself about , that he might appear , before the hour of closing , on his station at Tellson 's .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 65]: Whether his meditations on mortality had touched his liver , or whether his general health had been previously at all amiss , or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent man , is not so much to the purpose , as that he made a short call upon his medical adviser -- a distinguished surgeon -- on his way back .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 17]: Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest , and reported No job in his absence .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 27]: The bank closed , the ancient clerks came out , the usual watch was set , and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to tea .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 11]: `` Now , I tell you where it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 10]: said Mr. Cruncher to his wife , on entering .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 45]: `` If , as a honest tradesman , my wenturs goes wrong to-night , I shall make sure that you 've been praying again me , and I shall work you for it just the same as if I seen you do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 8]: The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 12]: `` Why , you 're at it afore my face ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 10]: said Mr. Cruncher , with signs of angry apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 7]: `` I am saying nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 10]: `` Well , then ; do n't meditate nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 8]: You might as well flop as meditate .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 12]: You may as well go again me one way as another .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 5]: Drop it altogether . ''
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 6]: `` Yes , Jerry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 14]: `` Yes , Jerry , '' repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 6]: It IS yes , Jerry .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 5]: That 's about it .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 8]: You may say yes , Jerry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 29]: Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations , but made use of them , as people not unfrequently do , to express general ironical dissatisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 37]: `` You and your yes , Jerry , '' said Mr. Cruncher , taking a bite out of his bread-and-butter , and seeming to help it down with a large invisible oyster out of his saucer .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 4]: I think so .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 5]: I believe you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 8]: `` You are going out to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 11]: asked his decent wife , when he took another bite .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 7]: `` Yes , I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 10]: `` May I go with you , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 6]: asked his son , briskly .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 7]: `` No , you may n't .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 13]: I 'm a going -- as your mother knows -- a fishing .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 8]: That 's where I 'm going to .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 5]: Going a fishing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 14]: `` Your fishing-rod gets rayther rusty ; do n't it , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 6]: `` Never you mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 11]: `` Shall you bring any fish home , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 46]: `` If I do n't , you 'll have short commons , to-morrow , '' returned that gentleman , shaking his head ; `` that 's questions enough for you ; I ai n't a going out , till you 've been long abed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 38]: He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher , and sullenly holding her in conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions to his disadvantage .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 50]: With this view , he urged his son to hold her in conversation also , and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling on any causes of complaint he could bring against her , rather than he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 26]: The devoutest person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 17]: It was as if a professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 6]: `` And mind you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 4]: said Mr. Cruncher .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 5]: `` No games to-morrow !
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 31]: If I , as a honest tradesman , succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two , none of your not touching of it , and sticking to bread .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 23]: If I , as a honest tradesman , am able to provide a little beer , none of your declaring on water .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 11]: When you go to Rome , do as Rome does .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 14]: Rome will be a ugly customer to you , if you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 10]: I ` m your Rome , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 20]: Then he began grumbling again : `` With your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink !
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 25]: I do n't know how scarce you may n't make the wittles and drink here , by your flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 15]: Look at your boy : he IS your ` n , ai n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 8]: He 's as thin as a lath .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 24]: Do you call yourself a mother , and not know that a mother 's first duty is to blow her boy out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 52]: This touched Young Jerry on a tender place ; who adjured his mother to perform her first duty , and , whatever else she did or neglected , above all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 30]: Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family , until Young Jerry was ordered to bed , and his mother , laid under similar injunctions , obeyed them .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 25]: Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with solitary pipes , and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 52]: Towards that small and ghostly hour , he rose up from his chair , took a key out of his pocket , opened a locked cupboard , and brought forth a sack , a crowbar of convenient size , a rope and chain , and other fishing tackle of that nature .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 26]: Disposing these articles about him in skilful manner , he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher , extinguished the light , and went out .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 24]: Young Jerry , who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to bed , was not long after his father .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 28]: Under cover of the darkness he followed out of the room , followed down the stairs , followed down the court , followed out into the streets .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 28]: He was in no uneasiness concerning his getting into the house again , for it was full of lodgers , and the door stood ajar all night .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 49]: Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his father 's honest calling , Young Jerry , keeping as close to house fronts , walls , and doorways , as his eyes were close to one another , held his honoured parent in view .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 29]: The honoured parent steering Northward , had not gone far , when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton , and the two trudged on together .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 31]: Within half an hour from the first starting , they were beyond the winking lamps , and the more than winking watchmen , and were out upon a lonely road .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 44]: Another fisherman was picked up here -- and that so silently , that if Young Jerry had been superstitious , he might have supposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have , all of a sudden , split himself into two .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 22]: The three went on , and Young Jerry went on , until the three stopped under a bank overhanging the road .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 18]: Upon the top of the bank was a low brick wall , surmounted by an iron railing .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 41]: In the shadow of bank and wall the three turned out of the road , and up a blind lane , of which the wall -- there , risen to some eight or ten feet high -- formed one side .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 43]: Crouching down in a corner , peeping up the lane , the next object that Young Jerry saw , was the form of his honoured parent , pretty well defined against a watery and clouded moon , nimbly scaling an iron gate .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 18]: He was soon over , and then the second fisherman got over , and then the third .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 20]: They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate , and lay there a little -- listening perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 11]: Then , they moved away on their hands and knees .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 20]: It was now Young Jerry 's turn to approach the gate : which he did , holding his breath .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 24]: Crouching down again in a corner there , and looking in , he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass !
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 40]: and all the gravestones in the churchyard -- it was a large churchyard that they were in -- looking on like ghosts in white , while the church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 13]: They did not creep far , before they stopped and stood upright .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 7]: And then they began to fish .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 9]: They fished with a spade , at first .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 15]: Presently the honoured parent appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 38]: Whatever tools they worked with , they worked hard , until the awful striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry , that he made off , with his hair as stiff as his father 's .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 27]: But , his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters , not only stopped him in his running away , but lured him back again .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 29]: They were still fishing perseveringly , when he peeped in at the gate for the second time ; but , now they seemed to have got a bite .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 23]: There was a screwing and complaining sound down below , and their bent figures were strained , as if by a weight .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 18]: By slow degrees the weight broke away the earth upon it , and came to the surface .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 57]: Young Jerry very well knew what it would be ; but , when he saw it , and saw his honoured parent about to wrench it open , he was so frightened , being new to the sight , that he made off again , and never stopped until he had run a mile or more .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 36]: He would not have stopped then , for anything less necessary than breath , it being a spectral sort of race that he ran , and one highly desirable to get to the end of .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 59]: He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen was running after him ; and , pictured as hopping on behind him , bolt upright , upon its narrow end , always on the point of overtaking him and hopping on at his side -- perhaps taking his arm -- it was a pursuer to shun .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 53]: It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too , for , while it was making the whole night behind him dreadful , he darted out into the roadway to avoid dark alleys , fearful of its coming hopping out of them like a dropsical boy 's -- Kite without tail and wings .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 27]: It hid in doorways too , rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors , and drawing them up to its ears , as if it were laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 19]: It got into shadows on the road , and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 32]: All this time it was incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him , so that when the boy got to his own door he had reason for being half dead .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 42]: And even then it would not leave him , but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair , scrambled into bed with him , and bumped down , dead and heavy , on his breast when he fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 29]: From his oppressed slumber , Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise , by the presence of his father in the family room .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 41]: Something had gone wrong with him ; at least , so Young Jerry inferred , from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the ears , and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 18]: `` I told you I would , '' said Mr. Cruncher , `` and I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 8]: `` Jerry , Jerry , Jerry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 4]: his wife implored .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 23]: `` You oppose yourself to the profit of the business , '' said Jerry , `` and me and my partners suffer .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 15]: You was to honour and obey ; why the devil do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 20]: `` I try to be a good wife , Jerry , '' the poor woman protested , with tears .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 14]: `` Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband 's business ?
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 10]: Is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business ?
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 17]: Is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 14]: `` You had n't taken to the dreadful business then , Jerry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 43]: `` It 's enough for you , '' retorted Mr. Cruncher , `` to be the wife of a honest tradesman , and not to occupy your female mind with calculations when he took to his trade or when he did n't .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 12]: A honouring and obeying wife would let his trade alone altogether .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 6]: Call yourself a religious woman ?
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 13]: If you 're a religious woman , give me a irreligious one !
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 33]: You have no more nat ` ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames river has of a pile , and similarly it must be knocked into you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 34]: The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice , and terminated in the honest tradesman 's kicking off his clay-soiled boots , and lying down at his length on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 34]: After taking a timid peep at him lying on his back , with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow , his son lay down too , and fell asleep again .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 14]: There was no fish for breakfast , and not much of anything else .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 41]: Mr. Cruncher was out of spirits , and out of temper , and kept an iron pot-lid by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher , in case he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 22]: He was brushed and washed at the usual hour , and set off with his son to pursue his ostensible calling .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 45]: Young Jerry , walking with the stool under his arm at his father 's side along sunny and crowded Fleet-street , was a very different Young Jerry from him of the previous night , running home through darkness and solitude from his grim pursuer .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 40]: His cunning was fresh with the day , and his qualms were gone with the night -- in which particulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London , that fine morning .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 39]: `` Father , '' said Young Jerry , as they walked along : taking care to keep at arm 's length and to have the stool well between them : `` what 's a Resurrection -- Man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 20]: Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered , `` How should I know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 15]: `` I thought you knowed everything , father , '' said the artless boy .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 3]: `` Hem !
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 30]: Well , '' returned Mr. Cruncher , going on again , and lifting off his hat to give his spikes free play , `` he 's a tradesman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 9]: `` What 's his goods , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 6]: asked the brisk Young Jerry .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 26]: `` His goods , '' said Mr. Cruncher , after turning it over in his mind , `` is a branch of Scientific goods . ''
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 12]: `` Persons ' bodies , ai n't it , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 5]: asked the lively boy .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 15]: `` I believe it is something of that sort , '' said Mr. Cruncher .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 23]: `` Oh , father , I should so like to be a Resurrection -- Man when I 'm quite growed up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 16]: Mr. Cruncher was soothed , but shook his head in a dubious and moral way .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 10]: `` It depends upon how you dewelop your talents .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 40]: Be careful to dewelop your talents , and never to say no more than you can help to nobody , and there 's no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit for . ''
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 63]: As Young Jerry , thus encouraged , went on a few yards in advance , to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar , Mr. Cruncher added to himself : `` Jerry , you honest tradesman , there 's hopes wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you , and a recompense to you for his mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 16]: XV Knitting There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 28]: As early as six o'clock in the morning , sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within , bending over measures of wine .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 31]: Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times , but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 27]: A sour wine , moreover , or a souring , for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 33]: No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur Defarge : but , a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark , lay hidden in the dregs of it .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 23]: This had been the third morning in succession , on which there had been early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 12]: It had begun on Monday , and here was Wednesday come .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 49]: There had been more of early brooding than drinking ; for , many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door , who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 49]: These were to the full as interested in the place , however , as if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine ; and they glided from seat to seat , and from corner to corner , swallowing talk in lieu of drink , with greedy looks .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 16]: Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company , the master of the wine-shop was not visible .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 73]: He was not missed ; for , nobody who crossed the threshold looked for him , nobody asked for him , nobody wondered to see only Madame Defarge in her seat , presiding over the distribution of wine , with a bowl of battered small coins before her , as much defaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 45]: A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind , were perhaps observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop , as they looked in at every place , high and low , from the kings palace to the criminal 's gaol .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 53]: Games at cards languished , players at dominoes musingly built towers with them , drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops of wine , Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve with her toothpick , and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible a long way off .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 14]: Thus , Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his , until midday .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 38]: It was high noontide , when two dusty men passed through his streets and under his swinging lamps : of whom , one was Monsieur Defarge : the other a mender of roads in a blue cap .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 11]: All adust and athirst , the two entered the wine-shop .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 36]: Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast of Saint Antoine , fast spreading as they came along , which stirred and flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 30]: Yet , no one had followed them , and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop , though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 7]: `` Good day , gentlemen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 4]: said Monsieur Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 12]: It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 11]: It elicited an answering chorus of `` Good day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 16]: `` It is bad weather , gentlemen , '' said Defarge , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 21]: Upon which , every man looked at his neighbour , and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 11]: Except one man , who got up and went out .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 29]: `` My wife , '' said Defarge aloud , addressing Madame Defarge : `` I have travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads , called Jacques .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 17]: I met him -- by accident -- a day and half 's journey out of Paris .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 14]: He is a good child , this mender of roads , called Jacques .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 9]: Give him to drink , my wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 9]: A second man got up and went out .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 24]: Madame Defarge set wine before the mender of roads called Jacques , who doffed his blue cap to the company , and drank .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 31]: In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark bread ; he ate of this between whiles , and sat munching and drinking near Madame Defarge 's counter .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 9]: A third man got up and went out .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 44]: Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine -- but , he took less than was given to the stranger , as being himself a man to whom it was no rarity -- and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 32]: He looked at no one present , and no one now looked at him ; not even Madame Defarge , who had taken up her knitting , and was at work .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 10]: `` Have you finished your repast , friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 7]: he asked , in due season .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 7]: `` Yes , thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 5]: `` Come , then !
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 13]: You shall see the apartment that I told you you could occupy .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 9]: It will suit you to a marvel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 56]: Out of the wine-shop into the street , out of the street into a courtyard , out of the courtyard up a steep staircase , out of the staircase into a garret , -- formerly the garret where a white-haired man sat on a low bench , stooping forward and very busy , making shoes .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 23]: No white-haired man was there now ; but , the three men were there who had gone out of the wine-shop singly .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 31]: And between them and the white-haired man afar off , was the one small link , that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 23]: Defarge closed the door carefully , and spoke in a subdued voice : `` Jacques One , Jacques Two , Jacques Three !
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 14]: This is the witness encountered by appointment , by me , Jacques Four .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 6]: He will tell you all .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 6]: Speak , Jacques Five ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 29]: The mender of roads , blue cap in hand , wiped his swarthy forehead with it , and said , `` Where shall I commence , monsieur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 18]: `` Commence , '' was Monsieur Defarge 's not unreasonable reply , `` at the commencement . ''
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 35]: `` I saw him then , messieurs , '' began the mender of roads , `` a year ago this running summer , underneath the carriage of the Marquis , hanging by the chain .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 6]: Behold the manner of it .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 34]: I leaving my work on the road , the sun going to bed , the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill , he hanging by the chain -- like this . ''
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 42]: Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance ; in which he ought to have been perfect by that time , seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 16]: Jacques One struck in , and asked if he had ever seen the man before ?
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 14]: `` Never , '' answered the mender of roads , recovering his perpendicular .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 10]: Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then ?
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 23]: `` By his tall figure , '' said the mender of roads , softly , and with his finger at his nose .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 18]: `` When Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening , ` Say , what is he like ? '
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 12]: I make response , ` Tall as a spectre . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 16]: `` You should have said , short as a dwarf , '' returned Jacques Two .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 7]: `` But what did I know ?
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 14]: The deed was not then accomplished , neither did he confide in me .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 2]: Observe !
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 12]: Under those circumstances even , I do not offer my testimony .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 22]: Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his finger , standing near our little fountain , and says , ` To me !
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 5]: Bring that rascal ! '
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 10]: My faith , messieurs , I offer nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 18]: `` He is right there , Jacques , '' murmured Defarge , to him who had interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 5]: `` Go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 4]: `` Good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 12]: said the mender of roads , with an air of mystery .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 16]: `` The tall man is lost , and he is sought -- how many months ?
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 7]: Nine , ten , eleven ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 11]: `` No matter , the number , '' said Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 14]: `` He is well hidden , but at last he is unluckily found .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 4]: Go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 21]: `` I am again at work upon the hill-side , and the sun is again about to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 37]: I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the village below , where it is already dark , when I raise my eyes , and see coming over the hill six soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 23]: In the midst of them is a tall man with his arms bound -- tied to his sides -- like this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 29]: With the aid of his indispensable cap , he represented a man with his elbows bound fast at his hips , with cords that were knotted behind him .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 95]: `` I stand aside , messieurs , by my heap of stones , to see the soldiers and their prisoner pass -LRB- for it is a solitary road , that , where any spectacle is well worth looking at -RRB- , and at first , as they approach , I see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound , and that they are almost black to my sight -- except on the side of the sun going to bed , where they have a red edge , messieurs .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 37]: Also , I see that their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the road , and are on the hill above it , and are like the shadows of giants .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 26]: Also , I see that they are covered with dust , and that the dust moves with them as they come , tramp , tramp !
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 20]: But when they advance quite near to me , I recognise the tall man , and he recognises me .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 35]: Ah , but he would be well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again , as on the evening when he and I first encountered , close to the same spot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 29]: He described it as if he were there , and it was evident that he saw it vividly ; perhaps he had not seen much in his life .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 38]: `` I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man ; he does not show the soldiers that he recognises me ; we do it , and we know it , with our eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 5]: ` Come on ! '
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 21]: says the chief of that company , pointing to the village , ` bring him fast to his tomb ! '
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 6]: and they bring him faster .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 3]: I follow .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 24]: His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight , his wooden shoes are large and clumsy , and he is lame .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 20]: Because he is lame , and consequently slow , they drive him with their guns -- like this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 17]: He imitated the action of a man 's being impelled forward by the butt-ends of muskets .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 15]: `` As they descend the hill like madmen running a race , he falls .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 8]: They laugh and pick him up again .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 21]: His face is bleeding and covered with dust , but he can not touch it ; thereupon they laugh again .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 50]: They bring him into the village ; all the village runs to look ; they take him past the mill , and up to the prison ; all the village sees the prison gate open in the darkness of the night , and swallow him -- like this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 21]: He opened his mouth as wide as he could , and shut it with a sounding snap of his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 23]: Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by opening it again , Defarge said , `` Go on , Jacques . ''
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 69]: `` All the village , '' pursued the mender of roads , on tiptoe and in a low voice , `` withdraws ; all the village whispers by the fountain ; all the village sleeps ; all the village dreams of that unhappy one , within the locks and bars of the prison on the crag , and never to come out of it , except to perish .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 36]: In the morning , with my tools upon my shoulder , eating my morsel of black bread as I go , I make a circuit by the prison , on my way to my work .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 27]: There I see him , high up , behind the bars of a lofty iron cage , bloody and dusty as last night , looking through .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 27]: He has no hand free , to wave to me ; I dare not call to him ; he regards me like a dead man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 10]: Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 39]: The looks of all of them were dark , repressed , and revengeful , as they listened to the countryman 's story ; the manner of all of them , while it was secret , was authoritative too .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 99]: They had the air of a rough tribunal ; Jacques One and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed , each with his chin resting on his hand , and his eyes intent on the road-mender ; Jacques Three , equally intent , on one knee behind them , with his agitated hand always gliding over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose ; Defarge standing between them and the narrator , whom he had stationed in the light of the window , by turns looking from him to them , and from them to him .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 10]: `` Go on , Jacques , '' said Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 12]: `` He remains up there in his iron cage some days .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 13]: The village looks at him by stealth , for it is afraid .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 47]: But it always looks up , from a distance , at the prison on the crag ; and in the evening , when the work of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain , all faces are turned towards the prison .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 18]: Formerly , they were turned towards the posting-house ; now , they are turned towards the prison .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 55]: They whisper at the fountain , that although condemned to death he will not be executed ; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris , showing that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child ; they say that a petition has been presented to the King himself .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 5]: What do I know ?
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 4]: It is possible .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 7]: Perhaps yes , perhaps no . ''
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 15]: `` Listen then , Jacques , '' Number One of that name sternly interposed .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 13]: `` Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 24]: All here , yourself excepted , saw the King take it , in his carriage in the street , sitting beside the Queen .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 31]: It is Defarge whom you see here , who , at the hazard of his life , darted out before the horses , with the petition in his hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 9]: `` And once again listen , Jacques ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 54]: said the kneeling Number Three : his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves , with a strikingly greedy air , as if he hungered for something -- that was neither food nor drink ; `` the guard , horse and foot , surrounded the petitioner , and struck him blows .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 4]: You hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 7]: `` I hear , messieurs . ''
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 9]: `` Go on then , '' said Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 44]: `` Again ; on the other hand , they whisper at the fountain , '' resumed the countryman , `` that he is brought down into our country to be executed on the spot , and that he will very certainly be executed .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 34]: They even whisper that because he has slain Monseigneur , and because Monseigneur was the father of his tenants -- serfs -- what you will -- he will be executed as a parricide .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 78]: One old man says at the fountain , that his right hand , armed with the knife , will be burnt off before his face ; that , into wounds which will be made in his arms , his breast , and his legs , there will be poured boiling oil , melted lead , hot resin , wax , and sulphur ; finally , that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 28]: That old man says , all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on the life of the late King , Louis Fifteen .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 9]: But how do I know if he lies ?
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 7]: I am not a scholar . ''
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 9]: `` Listen once again then , Jacques ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 12]: said the man with the restless hand and the craving air .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 86]: `` The name of that prisoner was Damiens , and it was all done in open day , in the open streets of this city of Paris ; and nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done , than the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion , who were full of eager attention to the last -- to the last , Jacques , prolonged until nightfall , when he had lost two legs and an arm , and still breathed !
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 13]: And it was done -- why , how old are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 14]: `` Thirty-five , '' said the mender of roads , who looked sixty .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 20]: `` It was done when you were more than ten years old ; you might have seen it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 4]: `` Enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 7]: said Defarge , with grim impatience .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 6]: `` Long live the Devil !
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 4]: Go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 24]: Some whisper this , some whisper that ; they speak of nothing else ; even the fountain appears to fall to that tune .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 34]: At length , on Sunday night when all the village is asleep , come soldiers , winding down from the prison , and their guns ring on the stones of the little street .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 33]: Workmen dig , workmen hammer , soldiers laugh and sing ; in the morning , by the fountain , there is raised a gallows forty feet high , poisoning the water . ''
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 26]: The mender of roads looked THROUGH rather than AT the low ceiling , and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 24]: `` All work is stopped , all assemble there , nobody leads the cows out , the cows are there with the rest .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 8]: At midday , the roll of drums .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 20]: Soldiers have marched into the prison in the night , and he is in the midst of many soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 33]: He is bound as before , and in his mouth there is a gag -- tied so , with a tight string , making him look almost as if he laughed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 23]: He suggested it , by creasing his face with his two thumbs , from the corners of his mouth to his ears .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 22]: `` On the top of the gallows is fixed the knife , blade upwards , with its point in the air .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 18]: He is hanged there forty feet high -- and is left hanging , poisoning the water . ''
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 30]: They looked at one another , as he used his blue cap to wipe his face , on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 7]: `` It is frightful , messieurs .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 10]: How can the women and the children draw water !
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 11]: Who can gossip of an evening , under that shadow !
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 7]: Under it , have I said ?
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 56]: When I left the village , Monday evening as the sun was going to bed , and looked back from the hill , the shadow struck across the church , across the mill , across the prison -- seemed to strike across the earth , messieurs , to where the sky rests upon it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 28]: The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other three , and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 7]: `` That 's all , messieurs .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 40]: I left at sunset -LRB- as I had been warned to do -RRB- , and I walked on , that night and half next day , until I met -LRB- as I was warned I should -RRB- this comrade .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 23]: With him , I came on , now riding and now walking , through the rest of yesterday and through last night .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 7]: And here you see me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 13]: After a gloomy silence , the first Jacques said , `` Good !
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 7]: You have acted and recounted faithfully .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 13]: Will you wait for us a little , outside the door ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 11]: `` Very willingly , '' said the mender of roads .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 18]: Whom Defarge escorted to the top of the stairs , and , leaving seated there , returned .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 18]: The three had risen , and their heads were together when he came back to the garret .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 8]: `` How say you , Jacques ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 4]: demanded Number One .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 6]: `` To be registered ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 14]: `` To be registered , as doomed to destruction , '' returned Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 4]: `` Magnificent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 7]: croaked the man with the craving .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 10]: `` The chateau , and all the race ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 4]: inquired the first .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 12]: `` The chateau and all the race , '' returned Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 4]: `` Extermination . ''
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 14]: The hungry man repeated , in a rapturous croak , `` Magnificent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 6]: and began gnawing another finger .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 27]: `` Are you sure , '' asked Jacques Two , of Defarge , `` that no embarrassment can arise from our manner of keeping the register ?
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 36]: Without doubt it is safe , for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it ; but shall we always be able to decipher it -- or , I ought to say , will she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 41]: `` Jacques , '' returned Defarge , drawing himself up , `` if madame my wife undertook to keep the register in her memory alone , she would not lose a word of it -- not a syllable of it .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 23]: Knitted , in her own stitches and her own symbols , it will always be as plain to her as the sun .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 5]: Confide in Madame Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 36]: It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives , to erase himself from existence , than to erase one letter of his name or crimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge . ''
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 28]: There was a murmur of confidence and approval , and then the man who hungered , asked : `` Is this rustic to be sent back soon ?
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 4]: I hope so .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 13]: He is very simple ; is he not a little dangerous ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 27]: `` He knows nothing , '' said Defarge ; `` at least nothing more than would easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 26]: I charge myself with him ; let him remain with me ; I will take care of him , and set him on his road .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 25]: He wishes to see the fine world -- the King , the Queen , and Court ; let him see them on Sunday . ''
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 7]: exclaimed the hungry man , staring .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 17]: `` Is it a good sign , that he wishes to see Royalty and Nobility ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 23]: `` Jacques , '' said Defarge ; `` judiciously show a cat milk , if you wish her to thirst for it .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 20]: Judiciously show a dog his natural prey , if you wish him to bring it down one day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 34]: Nothing more was said , and the mender of roads , being found already dozing on the topmost stair , was advised to lay himself down on the pallet-bed and take some rest .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 10]: He needed no persuasion , and was soon asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 22]: Worse quarters than Defarge 's wine-shop , could easily have been found in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 22]: Saving for a mysterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted , his life was very new and agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 50]: But , madame sat all day at her counter , so expressly unconscious of him , and so particularly determined not to perceive that his being there had any connection with anything below the surface , that he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 64]: For , he contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady might pretend next ; and he felt assured that if she should take it into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a murder and afterwards flay the victim , she would infallibly go through with it until the play was played out .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 33]: Therefore , when Sunday came , the mender of roads was not enchanted -LRB- though he said he was -RRB- to find that madame was to accompany monsieur and himself to Versailles .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 55]: It was additionally disconcerting to have madame knitting all the way there , in a public conveyance ; it was additionally disconcerting yet , to have madame in the crowd in the afternoon , still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to see the carriage of the King and Queen .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 14]: `` You work hard , madame , '' said a man near her .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 18]: `` Yes , '' answered Madame Defarge ; `` I have a good deal to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 9]: `` What do you make , madame ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 5]: `` Many things . ''
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 20]: `` For instance -- '' `` For instance , '' returned Madame Defarge , composedly , `` shrouds . ''
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 33]: The man moved a little further away , as soon as he could , and the mender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap : feeling it mightily close and oppressive .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 112]: If he needed a King and Queen to restore him , he was fortunate in having his remedy at hand ; for , soon the large-faced King and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach , attended by the shining Bull 's Eye of their Court , a glittering multitude of laughing ladies and fine lords ; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both sexes , the mender of roads bathed himself , so much to his temporary intoxication , that he cried Long live the King , Long live the Queen , Long live everybody and everything !
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 13]: as if he had never heard of ubiquitous Jacques in his time .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 36]: Then , there were gardens , courtyards , terraces , fountains , green banks , more King and Queen , more Bull 's Eye , more lords and ladies , more Long live they all !
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 7]: until he absolutely wept with sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 53]: During the whole of this scene , which lasted some three hours , he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company , and throughout Defarge held him by the collar , as if to restrain him from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 4]: `` Bravo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 25]: said Defarge , clapping him on the back when it was over , like a patron ; `` you are a good boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 26]: The mender of roads was now coming to himself , and was mistrustful of having made a mistake in his late demonstrations ; but no .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 29]: `` You are the fellow we want , '' said Defarge , in his ear ; `` you make these fools believe that it will last for ever .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 16]: Then , they are the more insolent , and it is the nearer ended . ''
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 4]: `` Hey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 14]: cried the mender of roads , reflectively ; `` that 's true . ''
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 6]: `` These fools know nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 43]: While they despise your breath , and would stop it for ever and ever , in you or in a hundred like you rather than in one of their own horses or dogs , they only know what your breath tells them .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 20]: Let it deceive them , then , a little longer ; it can not deceive them too much . ''
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 13]: Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client , and nodded in confirmation .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 28]: `` As to you , '' said she , `` you would shout and shed tears for anything , if it made a show and a noise .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 2]: Say !
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 5]: Would you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 9]: `` Truly , madame , I think so .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 5]: For the moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 38]: `` If you were shown a great heap of dolls , and were set upon them to pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage , you would pick out the richest and gayest .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 2]: Say !
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 5]: Would you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 7]: `` Truly yes , madame . ''
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 46]: And if you were shown a flock of birds , unable to fly , and were set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage , you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers ; would you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 8]: `` It is true , madame . ''
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 38]: `` You have seen both dolls and birds to-day , '' said Madame Defarge , with a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent ; `` now , go home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 73]: XVI Still Knitting Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the bosom of Saint Antoine , while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the darkness , and through the dust , and down the weary miles of avenue by the wayside , slowly tending towards that point of the compass where the chateau of Monsieur the Marquis , now in his grave , listened to the whispering trees .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 71]: Such ample leisure had the stone faces , now , for listening to the trees and to the fountain , that the few village scarecrows who , in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead stick to burn , strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and terrace staircase , had it borne in upon their starved fancy that the expression of the faces was altered .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 80]: A rumour just lived in the village -- had a faint and bare existence there , as its people had -- that when the knife struck home , the faces changed , from faces of pride to faces of anger and pain ; also , that when that dangling figure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain , they changed again , and bore a cruel look of being avenged , which they would henceforth bear for ever .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 102]: In the stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder was done , two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose , which everybody recognised , and which nobody had seen of old ; and on the scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the crowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified , a skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute , before they all started away among the moss and leaves , like the more fortunate hares who could find a living there .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 56]: Chateau and hut , stone face and dangling figure , the red stain on the stone floor , and the pure water in the village well -- thousands of acres of land -- a whole province of France -- all France itself -- lay under the night sky , concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 19]: So does a whole world , with all its greatnesses and littlenesses , lie in a twinkling star .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 52]: And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse the manner of its composition , so , sublimer intelligences may read in the feeble shining of this earth of ours , every thought and act , every vice and virtue , of every responsible creature on it .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 29]: The Defarges , husband and wife , came lumbering under the starlight , in their public vehicle , to that gate of Paris whereunto their journey naturally tended .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 24]: There was the usual stoppage at the barrier guardhouse , and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual examination and inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 19]: Monsieur Defarge alighted ; knowing one or two of the soldiery there , and one of the police .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 11]: The latter he was intimate with , and affectionately embraced .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 65]: When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky wings , and they , having finally alighted near the Saint 's boundaries , were picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his streets , Madame Defarge spoke to her husband : `` Say then , my friend ; what did Jacques of the police tell thee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 10]: `` Very little to-night , but all he knows .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 9]: There is another spy commissioned for our quarter .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 20]: There may be many more , for all that he can say , but he knows of one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 5]: `` Eh well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 13]: said Madame Defarge , raising her eyebrows with a cool business air .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 8]: `` It is necessary to register him .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 8]: How do they call that man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 6]: `` He is English . ''
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 6]: `` So much the better .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 4]: His name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 13]: `` Barsad , '' said Defarge , making it French by pronunciation .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 21]: But , he had been so careful to get it accurately , that he then spelt it with perfect correctness .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 7]: `` Barsad , '' repeated madame .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 3]: `` Good .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 4]: Christian name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 4]: `` John . ''
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 15]: `` John Barsad , '' repeated madame , after murmuring it once to herself .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 3]: `` Good .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 8]: His appearance ; is it known ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 60]: `` Age , about forty years ; height , about five feet nine ; black hair ; complexion dark ; generally , rather handsome visage ; eyes dark , face thin , long , and sallow ; nose aquiline , but not straight , having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek ; expression , therefore , sinister . ''
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 5]: `` Eh my faith .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 6]: It is a portrait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 5]: said madame , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 8]: `` He shall be registered to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 75]: They turned into the wine-shop , which was closed -LRB- for it was midnight -RRB- , and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her desk , counted the small moneys that had been taken during her absence , examined the stock , went through the entries in the book , made other entries of her own , checked the serving man in every possible way , and finally dismissed him to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 39]: Then she turned out the contents of the bowl of money for the second time , and began knotting them up in her handkerchief , in a chain of separate knots , for safe keeping through the night .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 48]: All this while , Defarge , with his pipe in his mouth , walked up and down , complacently admiring , but never interfering ; in which condition , indeed , as to the business and his domestic affairs , he walked up and down through life .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 22]: The night was hot , and the shop , close shut and surrounded by so foul a neighbourhood , was ill-smelling .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 36]: Monsieur Defarge 's olfactory sense was by no means delicate , but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than it ever tasted , and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 16]: He whiffed the compound of scents away , as he put down his smoked-out pipe .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 18]: `` You are fatigued , '' said madame , raising her glance as she knotted the money .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 9]: `` There are only the usual odours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 12]: `` I am a little tired , '' her husband acknowledged .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 36]: `` You are a little depressed , too , '' said madame , whose quick eyes had never been so intent on the accounts , but they had had a ray or two for him .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 10]: `` Oh , the men , the men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 6]: `` But my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 3]: began Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 6]: `` But my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 11]: repeated madame , nodding firmly ; `` but my dear !
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 11]: You are faint of heart to-night , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 28]: `` Well , then , '' said Defarge , as if a thought were wrung out of his breast , `` it IS a long time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 22]: `` It is a long time , '' repeated his wife ; `` and when is it not a long time ?
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 14]: Vengeance and retribution require a long time ; it is the rule . ''
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 19]: `` It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning , '' said Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 21]: `` How long , '' demanded madame , composedly , `` does it take to make and store the lightning ?
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 4]: Tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 15]: Defarge raised his head thoughtfully , as if there were something in that too .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 22]: `` It does not take a long time , '' said madame , `` for an earthquake to swallow a town .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 3]: Eh well !
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 12]: Tell me how long it takes to prepare the earthquake ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 12]: `` A long time , I suppose , '' said Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 19]: `` But when it is ready , it takes place , and grinds to pieces everything before it .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 17]: In the meantime , it is always preparing , though it is not seen or heard .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 5]: That is your consolation .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 4]: Keep it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 15]: She tied a knot with flashing eyes , as if it throttled a foe .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 37]: `` I tell thee , '' said madame , extending her right hand , for emphasis , `` that although it is a long time on the road , it is on the road and coming .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 11]: I tell thee it never retreats , and never stops .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 8]: I tell thee it is always advancing .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 45]: Look around and consider the lives of all the world that we know , consider the faces of all the world that we know , consider the rage and discontent to which the Jacquerie addresses itself with more and more of certainty every hour .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 5]: Can such things last ?
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 2]: Bah !
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 5]: I mock you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 45]: `` My brave wife , '' returned Defarge , standing before her with his head a little bent , and his hands clasped at his back , like a docile and attentive pupil before his catechist , `` I do not question all this .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 35]: But it has lasted a long time , and it is possible -- you know well , my wife , it is possible -- that it may not come , during our lives . ''
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 4]: `` Eh well !
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 4]: How then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 15]: demanded madame , tying another knot , as if there were another enemy strangled .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 12]: said Defarge , with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 9]: `` We shall not see the triumph . ''
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 19]: `` We shall have helped it , '' returned madame , with her extended hand in strong action .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 11]: `` Nothing that we do , is done in vain .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 15]: I believe , with all my soul , that we shall see the triumph .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 43]: But even if not , even if I knew certainly not , show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant , and still I would -- '' Then madame , with her teeth set , tied a very terrible knot indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 4]: `` Hold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 27]: cried Defarge , reddening a little as if he felt charged with cowardice ; `` I too , my dear , will stop at nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 21]: But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim and your opportunity , to sustain you .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 5]: Sustain yourself without that .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 34]: When the time comes , let loose a tiger and a devil ; but wait for the time with the tiger and the devil chained -- not shown -- yet always ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 52]: Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains out , and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene manner , and observing that it was time to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 18]: Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the wine-shop , knitting away assiduously .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 28]: A rose lay beside her , and if she now and then glanced at the flower , it was with no infraction of her usual preoccupied air .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 18]: There were a few customers , drinking or not drinking , standing or seated , sprinkled about .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 34]: The day was very hot , and heaps of flies , who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame , fell dead at the bottom .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 42]: Their decease made no impression on the other flies out promenading , who looked at them in the coolest manner -LRB- as if they themselves were elephants , or something as far removed -RRB- , until they met the same fate .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 8]: Curious to consider how heedless flies are !
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 13]: -- perhaps they thought as much at Court that sunny summer day .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 21]: A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she felt to be a new one .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 23]: She laid down her knitting , and began to pin her rose in her head-dress , before she looked at the figure .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 4]: It was curious .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 24]: The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose , the customers ceased talking , and began gradually to drop out of the wine-shop .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 11]: `` Good day , madame , '' said the new-comer .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 7]: `` Good day , monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 19]: She said it aloud , but added to herself , as she resumed her knitting : `` Hah !
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 54]: Good day , age about forty , height about five feet nine , black hair , generally rather handsome visage , complexion dark , eyes dark , thin , long and sallow face , aquiline nose but not straight , having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister expression !
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 8]: Good day , one and all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 25]: `` Have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac , and a mouthful of cool fresh water , madame . ''
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 7]: Madame complied with a polite air .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 8]: `` Marvellous cognac this , madame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 24]: It was the first time it had ever been so complemented , and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 17]: She said , however , that the cognac was flattered , and took up her knitting .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 21]: The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments , and took the opportunity of observing the place in general .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 10]: `` You knit with great skill , madame . ''
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 8]: `` I am accustomed to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 7]: `` A pretty pattern too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 6]: `` YOU think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 10]: said madame , looking at him with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 3]: `` Decidedly .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 9]: May one ask what it is for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 20]: `` Pastime , '' said madame , still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 6]: `` Not for use ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 4]: `` That depends .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 10]: I may find a use for it one day .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 31]: If I do -- Well , '' said madame , drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry , `` I 'll use it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 26]: It was remarkable ; but , the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 45]: Two men had entered separately , and had been about to order drink , when , catching sight of that novelty , they faltered , made a pretence of looking about as if for some friend who was not there , and went away .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 18]: Nor , of those who had been there when this visitor entered , was there one left .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 6]: They had all dropped off .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 17]: The spy had kept his eyes open , but had been able to detect no sign .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 18]: They had lounged away in a poverty-stricken , purposeless , accidental manner , quite natural and unimpeachable .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 24]: `` JOHN , '' thought madame , checking off her work as her fingers knitted , and her eyes looked at the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 17]: `` Stay long enough , and I shall knit ` BARSAD ' before you go . ''
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 9]: `` You have a husband , madame ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 5]: `` I have . ''
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 4]: `` Children ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 5]: `` No children . ''
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 6]: `` Business seems bad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 13]: `` Business is very bad ; the people are so poor . ''
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 9]: `` Ah , the unfortunate , miserable people !
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 10]: So oppressed , too -- as you say . ''
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 27]: `` As YOU say , '' madame retorted , correcting him , and deftly knitting an extra something into his name that boded him no good .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 18]: `` Pardon me ; certainly it was I who said so , but you naturally think so .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 4]: Of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 5]: `` I think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 8]: returned madame , in a high voice .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 18]: `` I and my husband have enough to do to keep this wine-shop open , without thinking .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 11]: All we think , here , is how to live .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 30]: That is the subject WE think of , and it gives us , from morning to night , enough to think about , without embarrassing our heads concerning others .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 5]: I think for others ?
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 5]: No , no . ''
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 57]: The spy , who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make , did not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face ; but , stood with an air of gossiping gallantry , leaning his elbow on Madame Defarge 's little counter , and occasionally sipping his cognac .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 13]: `` A bad business this , madame , of Gaspard 's execution .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 5]: the poor Gaspard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 7]: With a sigh of great compassion .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 5]: `` My faith ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 23]: returned madame , coolly and lightly , `` if people use knives for such purposes , they have to pay for it .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 18]: He knew beforehand what the price of his luxury was ; he has paid the price . ''
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 52]: `` I believe , '' said the spy , dropping his soft voice to a tone that invited confidence , and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face : `` I believe there is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood , touching the poor fellow ?
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 4]: Between ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 5]: `` Is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 5]: asked madame , vacantly .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 7]: `` Is there not ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 7]: -- Here is my husband ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 4]: said Madame Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 35]: As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door , the spy saluted him by touching his hat , and saying , with an engaging smile , `` Good day , Jacques ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 9]: Defarge stopped short , and stared at him .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 7]: `` Good day , Jacques ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 21]: the spy repeated ; with not quite so much confidence , or quite so easy a smile under the stare .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 15]: `` You deceive yourself , monsieur , '' returned the keeper of the wine-shop .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 7]: `` You mistake me for another .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 6]: That is not my name .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 6]: I am Ernest Defarge . ''
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 23]: `` It is all the same , '' said the spy , airily , but discomfited too : `` good day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 5]: `` Good day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 5]: answered Defarge , drily .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 30]: `` I was saying to madame , with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when you entered , that they tell me there is -- and no wonder !
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 18]: -- much sympathy and anger in Saint Antoine , touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard . ''
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 16]: `` No one has told me so , '' said Defarge , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 8]: `` I know nothing of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 52]: Having said it , he passed behind the little counter , and stood with his hand on the back of his wife 's chair , looking over that barrier at the person to whom they were both opposed , and whom either of them would have shot with the greatest satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 39]: The spy , well used to his business , did not change his unconscious attitude , but drained his little glass of cognac , took a sip of fresh water , and asked for another glass of cognac .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 22]: Madame Defarge poured it out for him , took to her knitting again , and hummed a little song over it .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 20]: `` You seem to know this quarter well ; that is to say , better than I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 3]: observed Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 13]: `` Not at all , but I hope to know it better .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 11]: I am so profoundly interested in its miserable inhabitants . ''
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 4]: `` Hah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 3]: muttered Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 36]: `` The pleasure of conversing with you , Monsieur Defarge , recalls to me , '' pursued the spy , `` that I have the honour of cherishing some interesting associations with your name . ''
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 7]: said Defarge , with much indifference .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 5]: `` Yes , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 21]: When Doctor Manette was released , you , his old domestic , had the charge of him , I know .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 6]: He was delivered to you .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 10]: You see I am informed of the circumstances ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 12]: `` Such is the fact , certainly , '' said Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 36]: He had had it conveyed to him , in an accidental touch of his wife 's elbow as she knitted and warbled , that he would do best to answer , but always with brevity .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 41]: `` It was to you , '' said the spy , `` that his daughter came ; and it was from your care that his daughter took him , accompanied by a neat brown monsieur ; how is he called ?
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 21]: -- in a little wig -- Lorry -- of the bank of Tellson and Company -- over to England . ''
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 10]: `` Such is the fact , '' repeated Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 6]: `` Very interesting remembrances ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 4]: said the spy .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 14]: `` I have known Doctor Manette and his daughter , in England . ''
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 3]: said Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 11]: `` You do n't hear much about them now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 4]: said the spy .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 26]: `` In effect , '' madame struck in , looking up from her work and her little song , `` we never hear about them .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 44]: We received the news of their safe arrival , and perhaps another letter , or perhaps two ; but , since then , they have gradually taken their road in life -- we , ours -- and we have held no correspondence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 11]: `` Perfectly so , madame , '' replied the spy .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 9]: `` She is going to be married . ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 4]: `` Going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 3]: echoed madame .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 12]: `` She was pretty enough to have been married long ago .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 11]: You English are cold , it seems to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 7]: You know I am English . ''
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 25]: `` I perceive your tongue is , '' returned madame ; `` and what the tongue is , I suppose the man is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 26]: He did not take the identification as a compliment ; but he made the best of it , and turned it off with a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 22]: After sipping his cognac to the end , he added : `` Yes , Miss Manette is going to be married .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 18]: But not to an Englishman ; to one who , like herself , is French by birth .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 10]: And speaking of Gaspard -LRB- ah , poor Gaspard !
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 7]: It was cruel , cruel ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 40]: , it is a curious thing that she is going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis , for whom Gaspard was exalted to that height of so many feet ; in other words , the present Marquis .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 19]: But he lives unknown in England , he is no Marquis there ; he is Mr. Charles Darnay .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 11]: D'Aulnais is the name of his mother 's family . ''
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 16]: Madame Defarge knitted steadily , but the intelligence had a palpable effect upon her husband .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 35]: Do what he would , behind the little counter , as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe , he was troubled , and his hand was not trustworthy .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 23]: The spy would have been no spy if he had failed to see it , or to record it in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 73]: Having made , at least , this one hit , whatever it might prove to be worth , and no customers coming in to help him to any other , Mr. Barsad paid for what he had drunk , and took his leave : taking occasion to say , in a genteel manner , before he departed , that he looked forward to the pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 33]: For some minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine , the husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them , lest he should come back .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 44]: `` Can it be true , '' said Defarge , in a low voice , looking down at his wife as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair : `` what he has said of Ma'amselle Manette ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 23]: `` As he has said it , '' returned madame , lifting her eyebrows a little , `` it is probably false .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 7]: But it may be true . ''
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 12]: `` If it is -- '' Defarge began , and stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 6]: `` If it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 5]: repeated his wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 32]: -- And if it does come , while we live to see it triumph -- I hope , for her sake , Destiny will keep her husband out of France . ''
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 39]: `` Her husband 's destiny , '' said Madame Defarge , with her usual composure , `` will take him where he is to go , and will lead him to the end that is to end him .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 7]: That is all I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 78]: `` But it is very strange -- now , at least , is it not very strange '' -- said Defarge , rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it , `` that , after all our sympathy for Monsieur her father , and herself , her husband 's name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment , by the side of that infernal dog 's who has just left us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 16]: `` Stranger things than that will happen when it does come , '' answered madame .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 25]: `` I have them both here , of a certainty ; and they are both here for their merits ; that is enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 28]: She roiled up her knitting when she had said those words , and presently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 47]: Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable decoration was gone , or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its disappearance ; howbeit , the Saint took courage to lounge in , very shortly afterwards , and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 84]: In the evening , at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned himself inside out , and sat on door-steps and window-ledges , and came to the corners of vile streets and courts , for a breath of air , Madame Defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place to place and from group to group : a Missionary -- there were many like her -- such as the world will do well never to breed again .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 5]: All the women knitted .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 46]: They knitted worthless things ; but , the mechanical work was a mechanical substitute for eating and drinking ; the hands moved for the jaws and the digestive apparatus : if the bony fingers had been still , the stomachs would have been more famine-pinched .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 15]: But , as the fingers went , the eyes went , and the thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 33]: And as Madame Defarge moved on from group to group , all three went quicker and fiercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken with , and left behind .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 13]: Her husband smoked at his door , looking after her with admiration .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 24]: `` A great woman , '' said he , `` a strong woman , a grand woman , a frightfully grand woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 33]: Darkness closed around , and then came the ringing of church bells and the distant beating of the military drums in the Palace Courtyard , as the women sat knitting , knitting .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 4]: Darkness encompassed them .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 60]: Another darkness was closing in as surely , when the church bells , then ringing pleasantly in many an airy steeple over France , should be melted into thundering cannon ; when the military drums should be beating to drown a wretched voice , that night all potent as the voice of Power and Plenty , Freedom and Life .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 41]: So much was closing in about the women who sat knitting , knitting , that they their very selves were closing in around a structure yet unbuilt , where they were to sit knitting , knitting , counting dropping heads .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 36]: XVII One Night Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in Soho , than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter sat under the plane-tree together .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 36]: Never did the moon rise with a milder radiance over great London , than on that night when it found them still seated under the tree , and shone upon their faces through its leaves .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 7]: Lucie was to be married to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 18]: She had reserved this last evening for her father , and they sat alone under the plane-tree .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 10]: `` You are happy , my dear father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 7]: `` Quite , my child . ''
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 14]: They had said little , though they had been there a long time .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 28]: When it was yet light enough to work and read , she had neither engaged herself in her usual work , nor had she read to him .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 39]: She had employed herself in both ways , at his side under the tree , many and many a time ; but , this time was not quite like any other , and nothing could make it so .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 11]: `` And I am very happy to-night , dear father .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 25]: I am deeply happy in the love that Heaven has so blessed -- my love for Charles , and Charles 's love for me .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 53]: But , if my life were not to be still consecrated to you , or if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us , even by the length of a few of these streets , I should be more unhappy and self-reproachful now than I can tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 18]: Even as it is -- '' Even as it was , she could not command her voice .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 20]: In the sad moonlight , she clasped him by the neck , and laid her face upon his breast .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 32]: In the moonlight which is always sad , as the light of the sun itself is -- as the light called human life is -- at its coming and its going .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 4]: `` Dearest dear !
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 36]: Can you tell me , this last time , that you feel quite , quite sure , no new affections of mine , and no new duties of mine , will ever interpose between us ?
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 11]: I know it well , but do you know it ?
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 12]: In your own heart , do you feel quite certain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 23]: Her father answered , with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could scarcely have assumed , `` Quite sure , my darling !
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 45]: More than that , '' he added , as he tenderly kissed her : `` my future is far brighter , Lucie , seen through your marriage , than it could have been -- nay , than it ever was -- without it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 10]: `` If I could hope THAT , my father !
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 8]: -- '' `` Believe it , love !
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 5]: Indeed it is so .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 18]: Consider how natural and how plain it is , my dear , that it should be so .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 45]: You , devoted and young , can not fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be wasted -- '' She moved her hand towards his lips , but he took it in his , and repeated the word . ''
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 24]: -- wasted , my child -- should not be wasted , struck aside from the natural order of things -- for my sake .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 34]: Your unselfishness can not entirely comprehend how much my mind has gone on this ; but , only ask yourself , how could my happiness be perfect , while yours was incomplete ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 21]: `` If I had never seen Charles , my father , I should have been quite happy with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 36]: He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy without Charles , having seen him ; and replied : `` My child , you did see him , and it is Charles .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 13]: If it had not been Charles , it would have been another .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 40]: Or , if it had been no other , I should have been the cause , and then the dark part of my life would have cast its shadow beyond myself , and would have fallen on you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 24]: It was the first time , except at the trial , of her ever hearing him refer to the period of his suffering .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 23]: It gave her a strange and new sensation while his words were in her ears ; and she remembered it long afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 4]: `` See ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 13]: said the Doctor of Beauvais , raising his hand towards the moon .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 18]: `` I have looked at her from my prison-window , when I could not bear her light .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 34]: I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think of her shining upon what I had lost , that I have beaten my head against my prison-walls .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 49]: I have looked at her , in a state so dun and lethargic , that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I could draw across her at the full , and the number of perpendicular lines with which I could intersect them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 36]: He added in his inward and pondering manner , as he looked at the moon , `` It was twenty either way , I remember , and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in . ''
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 36]: The strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time , deepened as he dwelt upon it ; but , there was nothing to shock her in the manner of his reference .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 18]: He only seemed to contrast his present cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 22]: `` I have looked at her , speculating thousands of times upon the unborn child from whom I had been rent .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 5]: Whether it was alive .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 17]: Whether it had been born alive , or the poor mother 's shock had killed it .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 13]: Whether it was a son who would some day avenge his father .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 18]: -LRB- There was a time in my imprisonment , when my desire for vengeance was unbearable . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 35]: Whether it was a son who would never know his father 's story ; who might even live to weigh the possibility of his father 's having disappeared of his own will and act .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 14]: Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 14]: She drew closer to him , and kissed his cheek and his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 28]: `` I have pictured my daughter , to myself , as perfectly forgetful of me -- rather , altogether ignorant of me , and unconscious of me .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 14]: I have cast up the years of her age , year after year .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 15]: I have seen her married to a man who knew nothing of my fate .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 23]: I have altogether perished from the remembrance of the living , and in the next generation my place was a blank . ''
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 4]: `` My father !
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 28]: Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who never existed , strikes to my heart as if I had been that child . ''
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 5]: `` You , Lucie ?
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 31]: It is out of the Consolation and restoration you have brought to me , that these remembrances arise , and pass between us and the moon on this last night .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 9]: -- What did I say just now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 7]: `` She knew nothing of you .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 7]: She cared nothing for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 3]: `` So !
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 67]: But on other moonlight nights , when the sadness and the silence have touched me in a different way -- have affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace , as any emotion that had pain for its foundations could -- I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell , and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 37]: I have seen her image in the moonlight often , as I now see you ; except that I never held her in my arms ; it stood between the little grated window and the door .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 16]: But , you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 16]: `` The figure was not ; the -- the -- image ; the fancy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 5]: That was another thing .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 14]: It stood before my disturbed sense of sight , but it never moved .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 14]: The phantom that my mind pursued , was another and more real child .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 16]: Of her outward appearance I know no more than that she was like her mother .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 17]: The other had that likeness too -- as you have -- but was not the same .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 7]: Can you follow me , Lucie ?
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 5]: Hardly , I think ?
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 16]: I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these perplexed distinctions . ''
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 24]: His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running cold , as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 44]: `` In that more peaceful state , I have imagined her , in the moonlight , coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 14]: My picture was in her room , and I was in her prayers .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 18]: Her life was active , cheerful , useful ; but my poor history pervaded it all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 55]: `` I was that child , my father , I was not half so good , but in my love that was I. '' `` And she showed me her children , '' said the Doctor of Beauvais , `` and they had heard of me , and had been taught to pity me .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 29]: When they passed a prison of the State , they kept far from its frowning walls , and looked up at its bars , and spoke in whispers .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 20]: She could never deliver me ; I imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 21]: But then , blessed with the relief of tears , I fell upon my knees , and blessed her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 12]: `` I am that child , I hope , my father .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 16]: O my dear , my dear , will you bless me as fervently to-morrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 32]: `` Lucie , I recall these old troubles in the reason that I have to-night for loving you better than words can tell , and thanking God for my great happiness .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 28]: My thoughts , when they were wildest , never rose near the happiness that I have known with you , and that we have before us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 21]: He embraced her , solemnly commended her to Heaven , and humbly thanked Heaven for having bestowed her on him .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 8]: By-and-bye , they went into the house .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 25]: There was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr. Lorry ; there was even to be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 42]: The marriage was to make no change in their place of residence ; they had been able to extend it , by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the apocryphal invisible lodger , and they desired nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 10]: Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 14]: They were only three at table , and Miss Pross made the third .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 31]: He regretted that Charles was not there ; was more than half disposed to object to the loving little plot that kept him away ; and drank to him affectionately .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 17]: So , the time came for him to bid Lucie good night , and they separated .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 32]: But , in the stillness of the third hour of the morning , Lucie came downstairs again , and stole into his room ; not free from unshaped fears , beforehand .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 37]: All things , however , were in their places ; all was quiet ; and he lay asleep , his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow , and his hands lying quiet on the coverlet .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 36]: She put her needless candle in the shadow at a distance , crept up to his bed , and put her lips to his ; then , leaned over him , and looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 38]: Into his handsome face , the bitter waters of captivity had worn ; but , he covered up their tracks with a determination so strong , that he held the mastery of them even in his sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 34]: A more remarkable face in its quiet , resolute , and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant , was not to be beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep , that night .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 37]: She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast , and put up a prayer that she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be , and as his sorrows deserved .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 18]: Then , she withdrew her hand , and kissed his lips once more , and went away .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 32]: So , the sunrise came , and the shadows of the leaves of the plane-tree moved upon his face , as softly as her lips had moved in praying for him .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 31]: XVIII Nine Days The marriage-day was shining brightly , and they were ready outside the closed door of the Doctor 's room , where he was speaking with Charles Darnay .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 58]: They were ready to go to church ; the beautiful bride , Mr. Lorry , and Miss Pross -- to whom the event , through a gradual process of reconcilement to the inevitable , would have been one of absolute bliss , but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should have been the bridegroom .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 73]: `` And so , '' said Mr. Lorry , who could not sufficiently admire the bride , and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet , pretty dress ; `` and so it was for this , my sweet Lucie , that I brought you across the Channel , such a baby ' Lord bless me ' How little I thought what I was doing !
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 16]: How lightly I valued the obligation I was conferring on my friend Mr. Charles ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 23]: `` You did n't mean it , '' remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross , `` and therefore how could you know it ?
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 3]: Nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 3]: `` Really ?
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 14]: Well ; but do n't cry , '' said the gentle Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 16]: `` I am not crying , '' said Miss Pross ; `` YOU are . ''
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 7]: `` I , my Pross ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 18]: -LRB- By this time , Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with her , on occasion . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 21]: `` You were , just now ; I saw you do it , and I do n't wonder at it .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 21]: Such a present of plate as you have made 'em , is enough to bring tears into anybody 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 40]: There 's not a fork or a spoon in the collection , '' said Miss Pross , `` that I did n't cry over , last night after the box came , till I could n't see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 34]: `` I am highly gratified , '' said Mr. Lorry , `` though , upon my honour , I had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance invisible to any one .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 3]: Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 15]: This is an occasion that makes a man speculate on all he has lost .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 6]: Dear , dear , dear !
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 19]: To think that there might have been a Mrs. Lorry , any time these fifty years almost ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 6]: `` Not at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 4]: From Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 13]: `` You think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 7]: asked the gentleman of that name .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 4]: `` Pooh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 14]: rejoined Miss Pross ; `` you were a bachelor in your cradle . ''
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 18]: observed Mr. Lorry , beamingly adjusting his little wig , `` that seems probable , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 25]: `` And you were cut out for a bachelor , '' pursued Miss Pross , `` before you were put in your cradle . ''
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 36]: `` Then , I think , '' said Mr. Lorry , `` that I was very unhandsomely dealt with , and that I ought to have had a voice in the selection of my pattern .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 2]: Enough !
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 57]: Now , my dear Lucie , '' drawing his arm soothingly round her waist , `` I hear them moving in the next room , and Miss Pross and I , as two formal folks of business , are anxious not to lose the final opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 57]: You leave your good father , my dear , in hands as earnest and as loving as your own ; he shall be taken every conceivable care of ; during the next fortnight , while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts , even Tellson 's shall go to the wall -LRB- comparatively speaking -RRB- before him .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 48]: And when , at the fortnight 's end , he comes to join you and your beloved husband , on your other fortnight 's trip in Wales , you shall say that we have sent him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 12]: Now , I hear Somebody 's step coming to the door .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 21]: Let me kiss my dear girl with an old-fashioned bachelor blessing , before Somebody comes to claim his own . ''
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 54]: For a moment , he held the fair face from him to look at the well-remembered expression on the forehead , and then laid the bright golden hair against his little brown wig , with a genuine tenderness and delicacy which , if such things be old-fashioned , were as old as Adam .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 17]: The door of the Doctor 's room opened , and he came out with Charles Darnay .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 31]: He was so deadly pale -- which had not been the case when they went in together -- that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 45]: But , in the composure of his manner he was unaltered , except that to the shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him , like a cold wind .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 26]: He gave his arm to his daughter , and took her down-stairs to the chariot which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 31]: The rest followed in another carriage , and soon , in a neighbouring church , where no strange eyes looked on , Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 49]: Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little group when it was done , some diamonds , very bright and sparkling , glanced on the bride 's hand , which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry 's pockets .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 52]: They returned home to breakfast , and all went well , and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker 's white locks in the Paris garret , were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight , on the threshold of the door at parting .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 13]: It was a hard parting , though it was not for long .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 25]: But her father cheered her , and said at last , gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms , `` Take her , Charles !
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 5]: She is yours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 17]: And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window , and she was gone .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 38]: The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious , and the preparations having been very simple and few , the Doctor , Mr. Lorry , and Miss Pross , were left quite alone .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 44]: It was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall , that Mr. Lorry observed a great change to have come over the Doctor ; as if the golden arm uplifted there , had struck him a poisoned blow .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 23]: He had naturally repressed much , and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 51]: But , it was the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry ; and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up-stairs , Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the wine-shop keeper , and the starlight ride .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 34]: `` I think , '' he whispered to Miss Pross , after anxious consideration , `` I think we had best not speak to him just now , or at all disturb him .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 20]: I must look in at Tellson 's ; so I will go there at once and come back presently .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 23]: Then , we will take him a ride into the country , and dine there , and all will be well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 21]: It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson 's , than to look out of Tellson 's .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 6]: He was detained two hours .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 38]: When he came back , he ascended the old staircase alone , having asked no question of the servant ; going thus into the Doctor 's rooms , he was stopped by a low sound of knocking .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 5]: `` Good God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 7]: he said , with a start .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 13]: Miss Pross , with a terrified face , was at his ear .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 7]: `` O me , O me !
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 5]: All is lost ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 7]: cried she , wringing her hands .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 9]: `` What is to be told to Ladybird ?
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 12]: He does n't know me , and is making shoes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 19]: Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her , and went himself into the Doctor 's room .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 36]: The bench was turned towards the light , as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before , and his head was bent down , and he was very busy .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 4]: `` Doctor Manette .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 8]: My dear friend , Doctor Manette ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 30]: The Doctor looked at him for a moment -- half inquiringly , half as if he were angry at being spoken to -- and bent over his work again .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 44]: He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat ; his shirt was open at the throat , as it used to be when he did that work ; and even the old haggard , faded surface of face had come back to him .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 16]: He worked hard -- impatiently -- as if in some sense of having been interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 24]: Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand , and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 16]: He took up another that was lying by him , and asked what it was .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 16]: `` A young lady 's walking shoe , '' he muttered , without looking up .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 10]: `` It ought to have been finished long ago .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 5]: Let it be . ''
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 6]: `` But , Doctor Manette .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 5]: Look at me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 16]: He obeyed , in the old mechanically submissive manner , without pausing in his work .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 9]: `` You know me , my dear friend ?
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 3]: Think again .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 7]: This is not your proper occupation .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 6]: Think , dear friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 8]: Nothing would induce him to speak more .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 30]: He looked up , for an instant at a time , when he was requested to do so ; but , no persuasion would extract a word from him .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 32]: He worked , and worked , and worked , in silence , and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall , or on the air .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 23]: The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover , was , that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 26]: In that , there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity -- as though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 43]: Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry , as important above all others ; the first , that this must be kept secret from Lucie ; the second , that it must be kept secret from all who knew him .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 34]: In conjunction with Miss Pross , he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution , by giving out that the Doctor was not well , and required a few days of complete rest .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 56]: In aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter , Miss Pross was to write , describing his having been called away professionally , and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand , represented to have been addressed to her by the same post .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 23]: These measures , advisable to be taken in any case , Mr. Lorry took in the hope of his coming to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 33]: If that should happen soon , he kept another course in reserve ; which was , to have a certain opinion that he thought the best , on the Doctor 's case .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 37]: In the hope of his recovery , and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable , Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him attentively , with as little appearance as possible of doing so .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 30]: He therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson 's for the first time in his life , and took his post by the window in the same room .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 27]: He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him , since , on being pressed , he became worried .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 36]: He abandoned that attempt on the first day , and resolved merely to keep himself always before him , as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen , or was falling .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 38]: He remained , therefore , in his seat near the window , reading and writing , and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of , that it was a free place .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 51]: Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink , and worked on , that first day , until it was too dark to see -- worked on , half an hour after Mr. Lorry could not have seen , for his life , to read or write .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 27]: When he put his tools aside as useless , until morning , Mr. Lorry rose and said to him : `` Will you go out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 35]: He looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner , looked up in the old manner , and repeated in the old low voice : `` Out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 9]: `` Yes ; for a walk with me .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 4]: Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 16]: He made no effort to say why not , and said not a word more .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 47]: But , Mr. Lorry thought he saw , as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk , with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands , that he was in some misty way asking himself , `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 18]: The sagacity of the man of business perceived an advantage here , and determined to hold it .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 21]: Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches , and observed him at intervals from the adjoining room .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 28]: He paced up and down for a long time before he lay down ; but , when he did finally lay himself down , he fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 19]: In the morning , he was up betimes , and went straight to his bench and to work .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 29]: On this second day , Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name , and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 26]: He returned no reply , but it was evident that he heard what was said , and that he thought about it , however confusedly .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 50]: This encouraged Mr. Lorry to have Miss Pross in with her work , several times during the day ; at those times , they quietly spoke of Lucie , and of her father then present , precisely in the usual manner , and as if there were nothing amiss .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 50]: This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment , not long enough , or often enough to harass him ; and it lightened Mr. Lorry 's friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener , and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 23]: When it fell dark again , Mr. Lorry asked him as before : `` Dear Doctor , will you go out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 10]: As before , he repeated , `` Out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 9]: `` Yes ; for a walk with me .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 4]: Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 29]: This time , Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer from him , and , after remaining absent for an hour , returned .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 40]: In the meanwhile , the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window , and had sat there looking down at the plane-tree ; but , on Mr. Lorry 's return , be slipped away to his bench .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 30]: The time went very slowly on , and Mr. Lorry 's hope darkened , and his heart grew heavier again , and grew yet heavier and heavier every day .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 13]: The third day came and went , the fourth , the fifth .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 15]: Five days , six days , seven days , eight days , nine days .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 24]: With a hope ever darkening , and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier , Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 72]: The secret was well kept , and Lucie was unconscious and happy ; but he could not fail to observe that the shoemaker , whose hand had been a little out at first , was growing dreadfully skilful , and that he had never been so intent on his work , and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert , as in the dusk of the ninth evening .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 17]: XIX An Opinion Worn out by anxious watching , Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 33]: On the tenth morning of his suspense , he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 25]: He rubbed his eyes and roused himself ; but he doubted , when he had done so , whether he was not still asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 40]: For , going to the door of the Doctor 's room and looking in , he perceived that the shoemaker 's bench and tools were put aside again , and that the Doctor himself sat reading at the window .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 31]: He was in his usual morning dress , and his face -LRB- which Mr. Lorry could distinctly see -RRB- , though still very pale , was calmly studious and attentive .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 82]: Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake , Mr. Lorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own ; for , did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect , and employed as usual ; and was there any sign within their range , that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened ?
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 17]: It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment , the answer being obvious .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 23]: If the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause , how came he , Jarvis Lorry , there ?
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 38]: How came he to have fallen asleep , in his clothes , on the sofa in Doctor Manette 's consulting-room , and to be debating these points outside the Doctor 's bedroom door in the early morning ?
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 13]: Within a few minutes , Miss Pross stood whispering at his side .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 31]: If he had had any particle of doubt left , her talk would of necessity have resolved it ; but he was by that time clear-headed , and had none .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 28]: He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast-hour , and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 39]: If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind , Mr. Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been , in his anxiety , so anxious to obtain .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 17]: Miss Pross , submitting herself to his judgment , the scheme was worked out with care .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 30]: Having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette , Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual white linen , and with his usual neat leg .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 14]: The Doctor was summoned in the usual way , and came to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 41]: So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe advance , he at first supposed that his daughter 's marriage had taken place yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 34]: An incidental allusion , purposely thrown out , to the day of the week , and the day of the month , set him thinking and counting , and evidently made him uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 24]: In all other respects , however , he was so composedly himself , that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid he sought .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 7]: And that aid was his own .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 79]: Therefore , when the breakfast was done and cleared away , and he and the Doctor were left together , Mr. Lorry said , feelingly : `` My dear Manette , I am anxious to have your opinion , in confidence , on a very curious case in which I am deeply interested ; that is to say , it is very curious to me ; perhaps , to your better information it may be less so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 22]: Glancing at his hands , which were discoloured by his late work , the Doctor looked troubled , and listened attentively .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 11]: He had already glanced at his hands more than once .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 30]: `` Doctor Manette , '' said Mr. Lorry , touching him affectionately on the arm , `` the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 33]: Pray give your mind to it , and advise me well for his sake -- and above all , for his daughter 's -- his daughter 's , my dear Manette . ''
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 22]: `` If I understand , '' said the Doctor , in a subdued tone , `` some mental shock -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 9]: `` Be explicit , '' said the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 6]: `` Spare no detail . ''
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 12]: Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another , and proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 41]: `` My dear Manette , it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock , of great acuteness and severity to the affections , the feelings , the -- the -- as you express it -- the mind .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 3]: The mind .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 45]: It is the case of a shock under which the sufferer was borne down , one can not say for how long , because I believe he can not calculate the time himself , and there are no other means of getting at it .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 35]: It is the case of a shock from which the sufferer recovered , by a process that he can not trace himself -- as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 55]: It is the case of a shock from which he has recovered , so completely , as to be a highly intelligent man , capable of close application of mind , and great exertion of body , and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowledge , which was already very large .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 23]: But , unfortunately , there has been , '' he paused and took a deep breath -- `` a slight relapse . ''
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 17]: The Doctor , in a low voice , asked , `` Of how long duration ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 7]: `` Nine days and nights . ''
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 7]: `` How did it show itself ?
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 24]: I infer , '' glancing at his hands again , `` in the resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 7]: `` That is the fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 33]: `` Now , did you ever see him , '' asked the Doctor , distinctly and collectedly , though in the same low voice , `` engaged in that pursuit originally ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 4]: `` Once . ''
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 26]: `` And when the relapse fell on him , was he in most respects -- or in all respects -- as he was then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 8]: `` I think in all respects . ''
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 7]: `` You spoke of his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 9]: Does his daughter know of the relapse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 17]: It has been kept from her , and I hope will always be kept from her .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 17]: It is known only to myself , and to one other who may be trusted . ''
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 15]: The Doctor grasped his hand , and murmured , `` That was very kind .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 6]: That was very thoughtful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 19]: Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return , and neither of the two spoke for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 44]: `` Now , my dear Manette , '' said Mr. Lorry , at length , in his most considerate and most affectionate way , `` I am a mere man of business , and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 23]: I do not possess the kind of information necessary ; I do not possess the kind of intelligence ; I want guiding .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 21]: There is no man in this world on whom I could so rely for right guidance , as on you .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 10]: Tell me , how does this relapse come about ?
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 6]: Is there danger of another ?
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 8]: Could a repetition of it be prevented ?
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 9]: How should a repetition of it be treated ?
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 8]: How does it come about at all ?
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 8]: What can I do for my friend ?
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 28]: No man ever can have been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend , than I am to serve mine , if I knew how .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 14]: But I do n't know how to originate , in such a case .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 36]: If your sagacity , knowledge , and experience , could put me on the right track , I might be able to do so much ; unenlightened and undirected , I can do so little .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 29]: Pray discuss it with me ; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly , and teach me how to be a little more useful . ''
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 19]: Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken , and Mr. Lorry did not press him .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 38]: `` I think it probable , '' said the Doctor , breaking silence with an effort , `` that the relapse you have described , my dear friend , was not quite unforeseen by its subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 8]: `` Was it dreaded by him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 6]: Mr. Lorry ventured to ask .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 5]: `` Very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 8]: He said it with an involuntary shudder .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 44]: `` You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer 's mind , and how difficult -- how almost impossible -- it is , for him to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 35]: `` Would he , '' asked Mr. Lorry , `` be sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one , when it is on him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 5]: `` I think so .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 14]: But it is , as I have told you , next to impossible .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 15]: I even believe it -- in some cases -- to be quite impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 37]: `` Now , '' said Mr. Lorry , gently laying his hand on the Doctor 's arm again , after a short silence on both sides , `` to what would you refer this attack ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 35]: `` I believe , '' returned Doctor Manette , `` that there had been a strong and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the malady .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 15]: Some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled , I think .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 35]: It is probable that there had long been a dread lurking in his mind , that those associations would be recalled -- say , under certain circumstances -- say , on a particular occasion .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 23]: He tried to prepare himself in vain ; perhaps the effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 12]: `` Would he remember what took place in the relapse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 8]: asked Mr. Lorry , with natural hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 26]: The Doctor looked desolately round the room , shook his head , and answered , in a low voice , `` Not at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 13]: `` Now , as to the future , '' hinted Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 21]: `` As to the future , '' said the Doctor , recovering firmness , `` I should have great hope .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 19]: As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon , I should have great hope .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 41]: He , yielding under the pressure of a complicated something , long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against , and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed , I should hope that the worst was over . ''
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 5]: `` Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 5]: That 's good comfort .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 5]: I am thankful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 4]: said Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 6]: `` I am thankful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 10]: repeated the Doctor , bending his head with reverence .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 22]: `` There are two other points , '' said Mr. Lorry , `` on which I am anxious to be instructed .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 6]: I may go on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 12]: `` You can not do your friend a better service . ''
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 7]: The Doctor gave him his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 7]: `` To the first , then .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 34]: He is of a studious habit , and unusually energetic ; he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional knowledge , to the conducting of experiments , to many things .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 9]: Now , does he do too much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 5]: `` I think not .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 18]: It may be the character of his mind , to be always in singular need of occupation .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 19]: That may be , in part , natural to it ; in part , the result of affliction .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 23]: The less it was occupied with healthy things , the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 12]: He may have observed himself , and made the discovery . ''
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 15]: `` You are sure that he is not under too great a strain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 11]: `` I think I am quite sure of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 25]: `` My dear Manette , if he were overworked now -- '' `` My dear Lorry , I doubt if that could easily be .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 17]: There has been a violent stress in one direction , and it needs a counterweight . ''
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 11]: `` Excuse me , as a persistent man of business .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 22]: Assuming for a moment , that he WAS overworked ; it would show itself in some renewal of this disorder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 7]: `` I do not think so .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 28]: I do not think , '' said Doctor Manette with the firmness of self-conviction , `` that anything but the one train of association would renew it .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 18]: I think that , henceforth , nothing but some extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 25]: After what has happened , and after his recovery , I find it difficult to imagine any such violent sounding of that string again .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 19]: I trust , and I almost believe , that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted . ''
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 44]: He spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing would overset the delicate organisation of the mind , and yet with the confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal endurance and distress .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 11]: It was not for his friend to abate that confidence .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 20]: He professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he really was , and approached his second and last point .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 43]: He felt it to be the most difficult of all ; but , remembering his old Sunday morning conversation with Miss Pross , and remembering what he had seen in the last nine days , he knew that he must face it .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 38]: `` The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from , '' said Mr. Lorry , clearing his throat , `` we will call -- Blacksmith 's work , Blacksmith 's work .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 33]: We will say , to put a case and for the sake of illustration , that he had been used , in his bad time , to work at a little forge .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 13]: We will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 14]: Is it not a pity that he should keep it by him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 18]: The Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand , and beat his foot nervously on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 22]: `` He has always kept it by him , '' said Mr. Lorry , with an anxious look at his friend .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 16]: `` Now , would it not be better that he should let it go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 17]: Still , the Doctor , with shaded forehead , beat his foot nervously on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 12]: `` You do not find it easy to advise me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 4]: said Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 11]: `` I quite understand it to be a nice question .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 16]: And yet I think -- '' And there he shook his head , and stopped .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 37]: `` You see , '' said Doctor Manette , turning to him after an uneasy pause , `` it is very hard to explain , consistently , the innermost workings of this poor man 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 84]: He once yearned so frightfully for that occupation , and it was so welcome when it came ; no doubt it relieved his pain so much , by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain , and by substituting , as he became more practised , the ingenuity of the hands , for the ingenuity of the mental torture ; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 68]: Even now , when I believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever been , and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence , the idea that he might need that old employment , and not find it , gives him a sudden sense of terror , like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child . ''
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 17]: He looked like his illustration , as he raised his eyes to Mr. Lorry 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 7]: `` But may not -- mind !
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 40]: I ask for information , as a plodding man of business who only deals with such material objects as guineas , shillings , and bank-notes -- may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of the idea ?
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 18]: If the thing were gone , my dear Manette , might not the fear go with it ?
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 18]: In short , is it not a concession to the misgiving , to keep the forge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 5]: There was another silence .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 22]: `` You see , too , '' said the Doctor , tremulously , `` it is such an old companion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 28]: `` I would not keep it , '' said Mr. Lorry , shaking his head ; for he gained in firmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 9]: `` I would recommend him to sacrifice it .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 6]: I only want your authority .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 8]: I am sure it does no good .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 11]: Give me your authority , like a dear good man .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 11]: For his daughter 's sake , my dear Manette ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 12]: Very strange to see what a struggle there was within him !
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 16]: `` In her name , then , let it be done ; I sanction it .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 13]: But , I would not take it away while he was present .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 21]: Let it be removed when he is not there ; let him miss his old companion after an absence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 13]: Mr. Lorry readily engaged for that , and the conference was ended .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 15]: They passed the day in the country , and the Doctor was quite restored .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 25]: On the three following days he remained perfectly well , and on the fourteenth day he went away to join Lucie and her husband .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 37]: The precaution that had been taken to account for his silence , Mr. Lorry had previously explained to him , and he had written to Lucie in accordance with it , and she had no suspicions .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 38]: On the night of the day on which he left the house , Mr. Lorry went into his room with a chopper , saw , chisel , and hammer , attended by Miss Pross carrying a light .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 54]: There , with closed doors , and in a mysterious and guilty manner , Mr. Lorry hacked the shoemaker 's bench to pieces , while Miss Pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder -- for which , indeed , in her grimness , she was no unsuitable figure .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 39]: The burning of the body -LRB- previously reduced to pieces convenient for the purpose -RRB- was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire ; and the tools , shoes , and leather , were buried in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 48]: So wicked do destruction and secrecy appear to honest minds , that Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross , while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its traces , almost felt , and almost looked , like accomplices in a horrible crime .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 25]: XX A Plea When the newly-married pair came home , the first person who appeared , to offer his congratulations , was Sydney Carton .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 14]: They had not been at home many hours , when he presented himself .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 37]: He was not improved in habits , or in looks , or in manner ; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity about him , which was new to the observation of Charles Darnay .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 22]: He watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window , and of speaking to him when no one overheard .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 17]: `` Mr. Darnay , '' said Carton , `` I wish we might be friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 10]: `` We are already friends , I hope . ''
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 26]: `` You are good enough to say so , as a fashion of speech ; but , I do n't mean any fashion of speech .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 21]: Indeed , when I say I wish we might be friends , I scarcely mean quite that , either . ''
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 21]: Charles Darnay -- as was natural -- asked him , in all good-humour and good-fellowship , what he did mean ?
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 29]: `` Upon my life , '' said Carton , smiling , `` I find that easier to comprehend in my own mind , than to convey to yours .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 6]: However , let me try .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 17]: You remember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk than -- than usual ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 20]: `` I remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that you had been drinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 6]: `` I remember it too .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 16]: The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me , for I always remember them .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 21]: I hope it may be taken into account one day , when all days are at an end for me !
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 13]: Do n't be alarmed ; I am not going to preach . ''
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 8]: `` I am not at all alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 12]: Earnestness in you , is anything but alarming to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 18]: said Carton , with a careless wave of his hand , as if he waved that away .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 31]: `` On the drunken occasion in question -LRB- one of a large number , as you know -RRB- , I was insufferable about liking you , and not liking you .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 8]: I wish you would forget it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 8]: `` I forgot it long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 6]: `` Fashion of speech again !
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 22]: But , Mr. Darnay , oblivion is not so easy to me , as you represent it to be to you .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 21]: I have by no means forgotten it , and a light answer does not help me to forget it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 20]: `` If it was a light answer , '' returned Darnay , `` I beg your forgiveness for it .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 27]: I had no other object than to turn a slight thing , which , to my surprise , seems to trouble you too much , aside .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 22]: I declare to you , on the faith of a gentleman , that I have long dismissed it from my mind .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 9]: Good Heaven , what was there to dismiss !
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 20]: Have I had nothing more important to remember , in the great service you rendered me that day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 53]: `` As to the great service , '' said Carton , `` I am bound to avow to you , when you speak of it in that way , that it was mere professional claptrap , I do n't know that I cared what became of you , when I rendered it .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 3]: -- Mind !
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 15]: I say when I rendered it ; I am speaking of the past . ''
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 24]: `` You make light of the obligation , '' returned Darnay , `` but I will not quarrel with YOUR light answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 10]: `` Genuine truth , Mr. Darnay , trust me !
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 16]: I have gone aside from my purpose ; I was speaking about our being friends .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 21]: Now , you know me ; you know I am incapable of all the higher and better flights of men .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 16]: If you doubt it , ask Stryver , and he 'll tell you so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 16]: `` I prefer to form my own opinion , without the aid of his . ''
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 23]: At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog , who has never done any good , and never will . ''
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 13]: `` I do n't know that you ` never will . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 14]: `` But I do , and you must take my word for it .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 91]: If you could endure to have such a worthless fellow , and a fellow of such indifferent reputation , coming and going at odd times , I should ask that I might be permitted to come and go as a privileged person here ; that I might be regarded as an useless -LRB- and I would add , if it were not for the resemblance I detected between you and me , an unornamental -RRB- piece of furniture , tolerated for its old service , and taken no notice of .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 9]: I doubt if I should abuse the permission .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 19]: It is a hundred to one if I should avail myself of it four times in a year .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 17]: It would satisfy me , I dare say , to know that I had it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 6]: `` Will you try ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 18]: `` That is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I have indicated .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 6]: I thank you , Darnay .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 10]: I may use that freedom with your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 12]: `` I think so , Carton , by this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 11]: They shook hands upon it , and Sydney turned away .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 18]: Within a minute afterwards , he was , to all outward appearance , as unsubstantial as ever .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 49]: When he was gone , and in the course of an evening passed with Miss Pross , the Doctor , and Mr. Lorry , Charles Darnay made some mention of this conversation in general terms , and spoke of Sydney Carton as a problem of carelessness and recklessness .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 30]: He spoke of him , in short , not bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him , but as anybody might who saw him as he showed himself .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 46]: He had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young wife ; but , when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms , he found her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly marked .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 7]: `` We are thoughtful to-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 9]: said Darnay , drawing his arm about her .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 41]: `` Yes , dearest Charles , '' with her hands on his breast , and the inquiring and attentive expression fixed upon him ; `` we are rather thoughtful to-night , for we have something on our mind to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 9]: `` What is it , my Lucie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 22]: `` Will you promise not to press one question on me , if I beg you not to ask it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 5]: `` Will I promise ?
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 10]: What will I not promise to my Love ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 28]: What , indeed , with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the cheek , and his other hand against the heart that beat for him !
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 22]: `` I think , Charles , poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and respect than you expressed for him to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 6]: `` Indeed , my own ?
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 4]: Why so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 11]: `` That is what you are not to ask me .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 11]: But I think -- I know -- he does . ''
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 10]: `` If you know it , it is enough .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 11]: What would you have me do , my Life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 28]: `` I would ask you , dearest , to be very generous with him always , and very lenient on his faults when he is not by .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 27]: I would ask you to believe that he has a heart he very , very seldom reveals , and that there are deep wounds in it .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 10]: My dear , I have seen it bleeding . ''
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 27]: `` It is a painful reflection to me , '' said Charles Darnay , quite astounded , `` that I should have done him any wrong .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 8]: I never thought this of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 8]: `` My husband , it is so .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 25]: I fear he is not to be reclaimed ; there is scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable now .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 21]: But , I am sure that he is capable of good things , gentle things , even magnanimous things . ''
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 29]: She looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man , that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 9]: `` And , O my dearest Love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 42]: she urged , clinging nearer to him , laying her head upon his breast , and raising her eyes to his , `` remember how strong we are in our happiness , and how weak he is in his misery ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 6]: The supplication touched him home .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 10]: `` I will always remember it , dear Heart !
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 11]: I will remember it as long as I live . ''
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 22]: He bent over the golden head , and put the rosy lips to his , and folded her in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 74]: If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets , could have heard her innocent disclosure , and could have seen the drops of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of that husband , he might have cried to the night -- and the words would not have parted from his lips for the first time -- `` God bless her for her sweet compassion ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 21]: XXI Echoing Footsteps A wonderful corner for echoes , it has been remarked , that corner where the Doctor lived .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 52]: Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound her husband , and her father , and herself , and her old directress and companion , in a life of quiet bliss , Lucie sat in the still house in the tranquilly resounding corner , listening to the echoing footsteps of years .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 33]: At first , there were times , though she was a perfectly happy young wife , when her work would slowly fall from her hands , and her eyes would be dimmed .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 28]: For , there was something coming in the echoes , something light , afar off , and scarcely audible yet , that stirred her heart too much .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 34]: Fluttering hopes and doubts -- hopes , of a love as yet unknown to her : doubts , of her remaining upon earth , to enjoy that new delight -- divided her breast .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 49]: Among the echoes then , there would arise the sound of footsteps at her own early grave ; and thoughts of the husband who would be left so desolate , and who would mourn for her so much , swelled to her eyes , and broke like waves .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 13]: That time passed , and her little Lucie lay on her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 23]: Then , among the advancing echoes , there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of her prattling words .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 21]: Let greater echoes resound as they would , the young mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 58]: They came , and the shady house was sunny with a child 's laugh , and the Divine friend of children , to whom in her trouble she had confided hers , seemed to take her child in his arms , as He took the child of old , and made it a sacred joy to her .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 47]: Ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together , weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all their lives , and making it predominate nowhere , Lucie heard in the echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 18]: Her husband 's step was strong and prosperous among them ; her father 's firm and equal .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 33]: Lo , Miss Pross , in harness of string , awakening the echoes , as an unruly charger , whip-corrected , snorting and pawing the earth under the plane-tree in the garden !
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 18]: Even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest , they were not harsh nor cruel .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 67]: Even when golden hair , like her own , lay in a halo on a pillow round the worn face of a little boy , and he said , with a radiant smile , `` Dear papa and mamma , I am very sorry to leave you both , and to leave my pretty sister ; but I am called , and I must go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 29]: those were not tears all of agony that wetted his young mother 's cheek , as the spirit departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 7]: Suffer them and forbid them not .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 7]: They see my Father 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 6]: O Father , blessed words !
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 33]: Thus , the rustling of an Angel 's wings got blended with the other echoes , and they were not wholly of earth , but had in them that breath of Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 80]: Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were mingled with them also , and both were audible to Lucie , in a hushed murmur -- like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore -- as the little Lucie , comically studious at the task of the morning , or dressing a doll at her mother 's footstool , chattered in the tongues of the Two Cities that were blended in her life .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 12]: The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 34]: Some half-dozen times a year , at most , he claimed his privilege of coming in uninvited , and would sit among them through the evening , as he had once done often .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 8]: He never came there heated with wine .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 25]: And one other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes , which has been whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 49]: No man ever really loved a woman , lost her , and knew her with a blameless though an unchanged mind , when she was a wife and a mother , but her children had a strange sympathy with him -- an instinctive delicacy of pity for him .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 26]: What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in such a case , no echoes tell ; but it is so , and it was so here .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 26]: Carton was the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms , and he kept his place with her as she grew .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 13]: The little boy had spoken of him , almost at the last .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 4]: `` Poor Carton !
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 6]: Kiss him for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 34]: Mr. Stryver shouldered his way through the law , like some great engine forcing itself through turbid water , and dragged his useful friend in his wake , like a boat towed astern .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 27]: As the boat so favoured is usually in a rough plight , and mostly under water , so , Sydney had a swamped life of it .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 64]: But , easy and strong custom , unhappily so much easier and stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace , made it the life he was to lead ; and he no more thought of emerging from his state of lion 's jackal , than any real jackal may be supposed to think of rising to be a lion .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 31]: Stryver was rich ; had married a florid widow with property and three boys , who had nothing particularly shining about them but the straight hair of their dumpling heads .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 48]: These three young gentlemen , Mr. Stryver , exuding patronage of the most offensive quality from every pore , had walked before him like three sheep to the quiet corner in Soho , and had offered as pupils to Lucie 's husband : delicately saying `` Halloa !
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 14]: here are three lumps of bread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic , Darnay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 46]: The polite rejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated Mr. Stryver with indignation , which he afterwards turned to account in the training of the young gentlemen , by directing them to beware of the pride of Beggars , like that tutor-fellow .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 54]: He was also in the habit of declaiming to Mrs. Stryver , over his full-bodied wine , on the arts Mrs. Darnay had once put in practice to `` catch '' him , and on the diamond-cut-diamond arts in himself , madam , which had rendered him `` not to be caught . ''
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 78]: Some of his King 's Bench familiars , who were occasionally parties to the full-bodied wine and the lie , excused him for the latter by saying that he had told it so often , that he believed it himself -- which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an originally bad offence , as to justify any such offender 's being carried off to some suitably retired spot , and there hanged out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 32]: These were among the echoes to which Lucie , sometimes pensive , sometimes amused and laughing , listened in the echoing corner , until her little daughter was six years old .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 41]: How near to her heart the echoes of her child 's tread came , and those of her own dear father 's , always active and self-possessed , and those of her dear husband 's , need not be told .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 35]: Nor , how the lightest echo of their united home , directed by herself with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any waste , was music to her .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 118]: Nor , how there were echoes all about her , sweet in her ears , of the many times her father had told her that he found her more devoted to him married -LRB- if that could be -RRB- than single , and of the many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed to divide her love for him or her help to him , and asked her `` What is the magic secret , my darling , of your being everything to all of us , as if there were only one of us , yet never seeming to be hurried , or to have too much to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 24]: But , there were other echoes , from a distance , that rumbled menacingly in the corner all through this space of time .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 34]: And it was now , about little Lucie 's sixth birthday , that they began to have an awful sound , as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 39]: On a night in mid -- July , one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine , Mr. Lorry came in late , from Tellson 's , and sat himself down by Lucie and her husband in the dark window .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 31]: It was a hot , wild night , and they were all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 30]: `` I began to think , '' said Mr. Lorry , pushing his brown wig back , `` that I should have to pass the night at Tellson 's .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 26]: We have been so full of business all day , that we have not known what to do first , or which way to turn .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 19]: There is such an uneasiness in Paris , that we have actually a run of confidence upon us !
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 19]: Our customers over there , seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 16]: There is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to England . ''
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 23]: `` That has a bad look , '' said Darnay -- `` A bad look , you say , my dear Darnay ?
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 14]: Yes , but we do n't know what reason there is in it .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 5]: People are so unreasonable !
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 27]: Some of us at Tellson 's are getting old , and we really ca n't be troubled out of the ordinary course without due occasion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 19]: `` Still , '' said Darnay , `` you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is . ''
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 45]: `` I know that , to be sure , '' assented Mr. Lorry , trying to persuade himself that his sweet temper was soured , and that he grumbled , `` but I am determined to be peevish after my long day 's botheration .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 5]: Where is Manette ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 18]: `` Here he is , '' said the Doctor , entering the dark room at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 32]: `` I am quite glad you are at home ; for these hurries and forebodings by which I have been surrounded all day long , have made me nervous without reason .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 10]: You are not going out , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 21]: `` No ; I am going to play backgammon with you , if you like , '' said the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 16]: `` I do n't think I do like , if I may speak my mind .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 11]: I am not fit to be pitted against you to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 8]: Is the teaboard still there , Lucie ?
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 6]: I ca n't see . ''
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 12]: `` Of course , it has been kept for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 7]: `` Thank ye , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 9]: The precious child is safe in bed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 6]: `` And sleeping soundly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 10]: `` That 's right ; all safe and well !
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 38]: I do n't know why anything should be otherwise than safe and well here , thank God ; but I have been so put out all day , and I am not as young as I was !
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 6]: My tea , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 3]: Thank ye .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 29]: Now , come and take your place in the circle , and let us sit quiet , and hear the echoes about which you have your theory . ''
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 11]: `` Not a theory ; it was a fancy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 19]: `` A fancy , then , my wise pet , '' said Mr. Lorry , patting her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 15]: `` They are very numerous and very loud , though , are they not ?
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 5]: Only hear them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 47]: Headlong , mad , and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody 's life , footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red , the footsteps raging in Saint Antoine afar off , as the little circle sat in the dark London window .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 39]: Saint Antoine had been , that morning , a vast dusky mass of scarecrows heaving to and fro , with frequent gleams of light above the billowy heads , where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 59]: A tremendous roar arose from the throat of Saint Antoine , and a forest of naked arms struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind : all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a weapon that was thrown up from the depths below , no matter how far off .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 88]: Who gave them out , whence they last came , where they began , through what agency they crookedly quivered and jerked , scores at a time , over the heads of the crowd , like a kind of lightning , no eye in the throng could have told ; but , muskets were being distributed -- so were cartridges , powder , and ball , bars of iron and wood , knives , axes , pikes , every weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 26]: People who could lay hold of nothing else , set themselves with bleeding hands to force stones and bricks out of their places in walls .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 16]: Every pulse and heart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 22]: Every living creature there held life as of no account , and was demented with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 81]: As a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point , so , all this raging circled round Defarge 's wine-shop , and every human drop in the caldron had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where Defarge himself , already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat , issued orders , issued arms , thrust this man back , dragged this man forward , disarmed one to arm another , laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 40]: `` Keep near to me , Jacques Three , '' cried Defarge ; `` and do you , Jacques One and Two , separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these patriots as you can .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 6]: Where is my wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 5]: `` Eh , well !
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 6]: Here you see me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 12]: said madame , composed as ever , but not knitting to-day .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 31]: Madame 's resolute right hand was occupied with an axe , in place of the usual softer implements , and in her girdle were a pistol and a cruel knife .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 10]: `` Where do you go , my wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 14]: `` I go , '' said madame , `` with you at present .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 13]: You shall see me at the head of women , by-and-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 6]: `` Come , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 8]: cried Defarge , in a resounding voice .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 9]: `` Patriots and friends , we are ready !
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 4]: The Bastille ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 41]: With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped into the detested word , the living sea rose , wave on wave , depth on depth , and overflowed the city to that point .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 20]: Alarm-bells ringing , drums beating , the sea raging and thundering on its new beach , the attack began .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 22]: Deep ditches , double drawbridge , massive stone walls , eight great towers , cannon , muskets , fire and smoke .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 49]: Through the fire and through the smoke -- in the fire and in the smoke , for the sea cast him up against a cannon , and on the instant he became a cannonier -- Defarge of the wine-shop worked like a manful soldier , Two fierce hours .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 22]: Deep ditch , single drawbridge , massive stone walls , eight great towers , cannon , muskets , fire and smoke .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 4]: One drawbridge down !
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 8]: `` Work , comrades all , work !
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 40]: Work , Jacques One , Jacques Two , Jacques One Thousand , Jacques Two Thousand , Jacques Five-and -- Twenty Thousand ; in the name of all the Angels or the Devils -- which you prefer -- work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 17]: Thus Defarge of the wine-shop , still at his gun , which had long grown hot .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 7]: `` To me , women ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 5]: cried madame his wife .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 15]: We can kill as well as the men when the place is taken ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 24]: And to her , with a shrill thirsty cry , trooping women variously armed , but all armed alike in hunger and revenge .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 30]: Cannon , muskets , fire and smoke ; but , still the deep ditch , the single drawbridge , the massive stone walls , and the eight great towers .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 13]: Slight displacements of the raging sea , made by the falling wounded .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 90]: Flashing weapons , blazing torches , smoking waggonloads of wet straw , hard work at neighbouring barricades in all directions , shrieks , volleys , execrations , bravery without stint , boom smash and rattle , and the furious sounding of the living sea ; but , still the deep ditch , and the single drawbridge , and the massive stone walls , and the eight great towers , and still Defarge of the wine-shop at his gun , grown doubly hot by the service of Four fierce hours .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 60]: A white flag from within the fortress , and a parley -- this dimly perceptible through the raging storm , nothing audible in it -- suddenly the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher , and swept Defarge of the wine-shop over the lowered drawbridge , past the massive stone outer walls , in among the eight great towers surrendered !
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 51]: So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on , that even to draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been struggling in the surf at the South Sea , until he was landed in the outer courtyard of the Bastille .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 18]: There , against an angle of a wall , he made a struggle to look about him .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 33]: Jacques Three was nearly at his side ; Madame Defarge , still heading some of her women , was visible in the inner distance , and her knife was in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 18]: Everywhere was tumult , exultation , deafening and maniacal bewilderment , astounding noise , yet furious dumb-show .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 5]: `` The Prisoners ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 5]: `` The Records ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 6]: `` The secret cells ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 7]: `` The instruments of torture ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 5]: `` The Prisoners ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 15]: Of all these cries , and ten thousand incoherences , `` The Prisoners ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 30]: was the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in , as if there were an eternity of people , as well as of time and space .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 73]: When the foremost billows rolled past , bearing the prison officers with them , and threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained undisclosed , Defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of these men -- a man with a grey head , who had a lighted torch in his hand -- separated him from the rest , and got him between himself and the wall .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 8]: `` Show me the North Tower ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 3]: said Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 4]: `` Quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 18]: `` I will faithfully , '' replied the man , `` if you will come with me .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 8]: But there is no one there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 15]: `` What is the meaning of One Hundred and Five , North Tower ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 3]: asked Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 4]: `` Quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 7]: `` The meaning , monsieur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 13]: `` Does it mean a captive , or a place of captivity ?
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 12]: Or do you mean that I shall strike you dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 5]: `` Kill him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 10]: croaked Jacques Three , who had come close up .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 9]: `` Monsieur , it is a cell . ''
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 6]: `` Show it me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 8]: `` Pass this way , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 40]: Jacques Three , with his usual craving on him , and evidently disappointed by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed , held by Defarge 's arm as he held by the turnkey 's .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 58]: Their three heads had been close together during this brief discourse , and it had been as much as they could do to hear one another , even then : so tremendous was the noise of the living ocean , in its irruption into the Fortress , and its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 36]: All around outside , too , it beat the walls with a deep , hoarse roar , from which , occasionally , some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the air like spray .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 68]: Through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone , past hideous doors of dark dens and cages , down cavernous flights of steps , and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick , more like dry waterfalls than staircases , Defarge , the turnkey , and Jacques Three , linked hand and arm , went with all the speed they could make .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 37]: Here and there , especially at first , the inundation started on them and swept by ; but when they had done descending , and were winding and climbing up a tower , they were alone .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 49]: Hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls and arches , the storm within the fortress and without was only audible to them in a dull , subdued way , as if the noise out of which they had come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 45]: The turnkey stopped at a low door , put a key in a clashing lock , swung the door slowly open , and said , as they all bent their heads and passed in : `` One hundred and five , North Tower ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 36]: There was a small , heavily-grated , unglazed window high in the wall , with a stone screen before it , so that the sky could be only seen by stooping low and looking up .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 15]: There was a small chimney , heavily barred across , a few feet within .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 12]: There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes on the hearth .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 13]: There was a stool , and table , and a straw bed .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 17]: There were the four blackened walls , and a rusted iron ring in one of them .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 22]: `` Pass that torch slowly along these walls , that I may see them , '' said Defarge to the turnkey .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 14]: The man obeyed , and Defarge followed the light closely with his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 3]: `` Stop !
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 7]: -- Look here , Jacques ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 5]: `` A. M. ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 9]: croaked Jacques Three , as he read greedily .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 24]: `` Alexandre Manette , '' said Defarge in his ear , following the letters with his swart forefinger , deeply engrained with gunpowder .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 11]: `` And here he wrote ` a poor physician . '
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 16]: And it was he , without doubt , who scratched a calendar on this stone .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 7]: What is that in your hand ?
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 3]: A crowbar ?
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 5]: Give it me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 13]: He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 28]: He made a sudden exchange of the two instruments , and turning on the worm-eaten stool and table , beat them to pieces in a few blows .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 7]: `` Hold the light higher ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 9]: he said , wrathfully , to the turnkey .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 10]: `` Look among those fragments with care , Jacques .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 3]: And see !
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 22]: Here is my knife , '' throwing it to him ; `` rip open that bed , and search the straw .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 8]: Hold the light higher , you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 39]: With a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth , and , peering up the chimney , struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar , and worked at the iron grating across it .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 55]: In a few minutes , some mortar and dust came dropping down , which he averted his face to avoid ; and in it , and in the old wood-ashes , and in a crevice in the chimney into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself , he groped with a cautious touch .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 15]: `` Nothing in the wood , and nothing in the straw , Jacques ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 4]: `` Nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 14]: `` Let us collect them together , in the middle of the cell .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 2]: So !
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 6]: Light them , you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 13]: The turnkey fired the little pile , which blazed high and hot .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 45]: Stooping again to come out at the low-arched door , they left it burning , and retraced their way to the courtyard ; seeming to recover their sense of hearing as they came down , until they were in the raging flood once more .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 13]: They found it surging and tossing , in quest of Defarge himself .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 26]: Saint Antoine was clamorous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in the guard upon the governor who had defended the Bastille and shot the people .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 16]: Otherwise , the governor would not be marched to the Hotel de Ville for judgment .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 27]: Otherwise , the governor would escape , and the people 's blood -LRB- suddenly of some value , after many years of worthlessness -RRB- be unavenged .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 40]: In the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red decoration , there was but one quite steady figure , and that was a woman 's .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 9]: `` See , there is my husband ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 7]: she cried , pointing him out .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 5]: `` See Defarge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 112]: She stood immovable close to the grim old officer , and remained immovable close to him ; remained immovable close to him through the streets , as Defarge and the rest bore him along ; remained immovable close to him when he was got near his destination , and began to be struck at from behind ; remained immovable close to him when the long-gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy ; was so close to him when he dropped dead under it , that , suddenly animated , she put her foot upon his neck , and with her cruel knife -- long ready -- hewed off his head .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 29]: The hour was come , when Saint Antoine was to execute his horrible idea of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 60]: Saint Antoine 's blood was up , and the blood of tyranny and domination by the iron hand was down -- down on the steps of the Hotel de Ville where the governor 's body lay -- down on the sole of the shoe of Madame Defarge where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 7]: `` Lower the lamp yonder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 28]: cried Saint Antoine , after glaring round for a new means of death ; `` here is one of his soldiers to be left on guard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 12]: The swinging sentinel was posted , and the sea rushed on .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 29]: The sea of black and threatening waters , and of destructive upheaving of wave against wave , whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces were yet unknown .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 32]: The remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes , voices of vengeance , and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering until the touch of pity could make no mark on them .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 50]: But , in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was in vivid life , there were two groups of faces -- each seven in number -- so fixedly contrasting with the rest , that never did sea roll which bore more memorable wrecks with it .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 50]: Seven faces of prisoners , suddenly released by the storm that had burst their tomb , were carried high overhead : all scared , all lost , all wondering and amazed , as if the Last Day were come , and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 24]: Other seven faces there were , carried higher , seven dead faces , whose drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last Day .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 51]: Impassive faces , yet with a suspended -- not an abolished -- expression on them ; faces , rather , in a fearful pause , as having yet to raise the dropped lids of the eyes , and bear witness with the bloodless lips , `` THOU DIDST IT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 72]: Seven prisoners released , seven gory heads on pikes , the keys of the accursed fortress of the eight strong towers , some discovered letters and other memorials of prisoners of old time , long dead of broken hearts , -- such , and such -- like , the loudly echoing footsteps of Saint Antoine escort through the Paris streets in mid -- July , one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 20]: Now , Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay , and keep these feet far out of her life !
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 39]: For , they are headlong , mad , and dangerous ; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask at Defarge 's wine-shop door , they are not easily purified when once stained red .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 58]: XXII The Sea Still Rises Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week , in which to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could , with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations , when Madame Defarge sat at her counter , as usual , presiding over the customers .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 35]: Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head , for the great brotherhood of Spies had become , even in one short week , extremely chary of trusting themselves to the saint 's mercies .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 13]: The lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 23]: Madame Defarge , with her arms folded , sat in the morning light and heat , contemplating the wine-shop and the street .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 27]: In both , there were several knots of loungers , squalid and miserable , but now with a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 63]: The raggedest nightcap , awry on the wretchedest head , had this crooked significance in it : `` I know how hard it has grown for me , the wearer of this , to support life in myself ; but do you know how easy it has grown for me , the wearer of this , to destroy life in you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 26]: Every lean bare arm , that had been without work before , had this work always ready for it now , that it could strike .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 17]: The fingers of the knitting women were vicious , with the experience that they could tear .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 35]: There was a change in the appearance of Saint Antoine ; the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years , and the last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 24]: Madame Defarge sat observing it , with such suppressed approval as was to be desired in the leader of the Saint Antoine women .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 8]: One of her sisterhood knitted beside her .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 31]: The short , rather plump wife of a starved grocer , and the mother of two children withal , this lieutenant had already earned the complimentary name of The Vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 4]: `` Hark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 4]: said The Vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 5]: `` Listen , then !
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 4]: Who comes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 32]: As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine Quarter to the wine-shop door , had been suddenly fired , a fast-spreading murmur came rushing along .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 9]: `` It is Defarge , '' said madame .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 6]: `` Silence , patriots ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 18]: Defarge came in breathless , pulled off a red cap he wore , and looked around him !
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 6]: `` Listen , everywhere ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 4]: said madame again .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 6]: `` Listen to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 31]: Defarge stood , panting , against a background of eager eyes and open mouths , formed outside the door ; all those within the wine-shop had sprung to their feet .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 7]: `` Say then , my husband .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 8]: `` News from the other world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 6]: `` How , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 5]: cried madame , contemptuously .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 6]: `` The other world ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 29]: `` Does everybody here recall old Foulon , who told the famished people that they might eat grass , and who died , and went to Hell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 4]: `` Everybody ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 4]: from all throats .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 7]: `` The news is of him .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 6]: He is among us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 5]: `` Among us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 6]: from the universal throat again .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 5]: `` And dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 4]: `` Not dead !
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 26]: He feared us so much -- and with reason -- that he caused himself to be represented as dead , and had a grand mock-funeral .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 18]: But they have found him alive , hiding in the country , and have brought him in .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 19]: I have seen him but now , on his way to the Hotel de Ville , a prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 11]: I have said that he had reason to fear us .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 3]: Say all !
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 5]: HAD he reason ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 38]: Wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten , if he had never known it yet , he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he could have heard the answering cry .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 7]: A moment of profound silence followed .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 10]: Defarge and his wife looked steadfastly at one another .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 23]: The Vengeance stooped , and the jar of a drum was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 4]: `` Patriots ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 14]: said Defarge , in a determined voice , `` are we ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 64]: Instantly Madame Defarge 's knife was in her girdle ; the drum was beating in the streets , as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic ; and The Vengeance , uttering terrific shrieks , and flinging her arms about her head like all the forty Furies at once , was tearing from house to house , rousing the women .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 43]: The men were terrible , in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked from windows , caught up what arms they had , and came pouring down into the streets ; but , the women were a sight to chill the boldest .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 52]: From such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded , from their children , from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground famished and naked , they ran out with streaming hair , urging one another , and themselves , to madness with the wildest cries and actions .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 7]: Villain Foulon taken , my sister !
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 7]: Old Foulon taken , my mother !
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 7]: Miscreant Foulon taken , my daughter !
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 27]: Then , a score of others ran into the midst of these , beating their breasts , tearing their hair , and screaming , Foulon alive !
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 11]: Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass !
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 21]: Foulon who told my old father that he might eat grass , when I had no bread to give him !
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 18]: Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass , when these breasts where dry with want !
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 8]: O mother of God , this Foulon !
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 5]: O Heaven our suffering !
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 27]: Hear me , my dead baby and my withered father : I swear on my knees , on these stones , to avenge you on Foulon !
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 58]: Husbands , and brothers , and young men , Give us the blood of Foulon , Give us the head of Foulon , Give us the heart of Foulon , Give us the body and soul of Foulon , Rend Foulon to pieces , and dig him into the ground , that grass may grow from him !
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 48]: With these cries , numbers of the women , lashed into blind frenzy , whirled about , striking and tearing at their own friends until they dropped into a passionate swoon , and were only saved by the men belonging to them from being trampled under foot .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 12]: Nevertheless , not a moment was lost ; not a moment !
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 14]: This Foulon was at the Hotel de Ville , and might be loosed .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 15]: Never , if Saint Antoine knew his own sufferings , insults , and wrongs !
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 55]: Armed men and women flocked out of the Quarter so fast , and drew even these last dregs after them with such a force of suction , that within a quarter of an hour there was not a human creature in Saint Antoine 's bosom but a few old crones and the wailing children .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 32]: They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination where this old man , ugly and wicked , was , and overflowing into the adjacent open space and streets .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 31]: The Defarges , husband and wife , The Vengeance , and Jacques Three , were in the first press , and at no great distance from him in the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 4]: `` See ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 8]: cried madame , pointing with her knife .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 9]: `` See the old villain bound with ropes .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 14]: That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 5]: That was well done .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 7]: Let him eat it now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 17]: Madame put her knife under her arm , and clapped her hands as at a play .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 40]: The people immediately behind Madame Defarge , explaining the cause of her satisfaction to those behind them , and those again explaining to others , and those to others , the neighbouring streets resounded with the clapping of hands .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 84]: Similarly , during two or three hours of drawl , and the winnowing of many bushels of words , Madame Defarge 's frequent expressions of impatience were taken up , with marvellous quickness , at a distance : the more readily , because certain men who had by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture to look in from the windows , knew Madame Defarge well , and acted as a telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 28]: At length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or protection , directly down upon the old prisoner 's head .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 35]: The favour was too much to bear ; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had stood surprisingly long , went to the winds , and Saint Antoine had got him !
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 13]: It was known directly , to the furthest confines of the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 94]: Defarge had but sprung over a railing and a table , and folded the miserable wretch in a deadly embrace -- Madame Defarge had but followed and turned her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied -- The Vengeance and Jacques Three were not yet up with them , and the men at the windows had not yet swooped into the Hall , like birds of prey from their high perches -- when the cry seemed to go up , all over the city , `` Bring him out !
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 7]: Bring him to the lamp ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 194]: Down , and up , and head foremost on the steps of the building ; now , on his knees ; now , on his feet ; now , on his back ; dragged , and struck at , and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his face by hundreds of hands ; torn , bruised , panting , bleeding , yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy ; now full of vehement agony of action , with a small clear space about him as the people drew one another back that they might see ; now , a log of dead wood drawn through a forest of legs ; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one of the fatal lamps swung , and there Madame Defarge let him go -- as a cat might have done to a mouse -- and silently and composedly looked at him while they made ready , and while he besought her : the women passionately screeching at him all the time , and the men sternly calling out to have him killed with grass in his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 71]: Once , he went aloft , and the rope broke , and they caught him shrieking ; twice , he went aloft , and the rope broke , and they caught him shrieking ; then , the rope was merciful , and held him , and his head was soon upon a pike , with grass enough in the mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 67]: Nor was this the end of the day 's bad work , for Saint Antoine so shouted and danced his angry blood up , that it boiled again , on hearing when the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched , another of the people 's enemies and insulters , was coming into Paris under a guard five hundred strong , in cavalry alone .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 53]: Saint Antoine wrote his crimes on flaring sheets of paper , seized him -- would have torn him out of the breast of an army to bear Foulon company -- set his head and heart on pikes , and carried the three spoils of the day , in Wolf-procession through the streets .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 19]: Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children , wailing and breadless .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 54]: Then , the miserable bakers ' shops were beset by long files of them , patiently waiting to buy bad bread ; and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty , they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day , and achieving them again in gossip .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 45]: Gradually , these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away ; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows , and slender fires were made in the streets , at which neighbours cooked in common , afterwards supping at their doors .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 20]: Scanty and insufficient suppers those , and innocent of meat , as of most other sauce to wretched bread .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 22]: Yet , human fellowship infused some nourishment into the flinty viands , and struck some sparks of cheerfulness out of them .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 40]: Fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day , played gently with their meagre children ; and lovers , with such a world around them and before them , loved and hoped .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 46]: It was almost morning , when Defarge 's wine-shop parted with its last knot of customers , and Monsieur Defarge said to madame his wife , in husky tones , while fastening the door : `` At last it is come , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 5]: `` Eh well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 3]: returned madame .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 4]: `` Almost . ''
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 24]: Saint Antoine slept , the Defarges slept : even The Vengeance slept with her starved grocer , and the drum was at rest .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 18]: The drum 's was the only voice in Saint Antoine that blood and hurry had not changed .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 51]: The Vengeance , as custodian of the drum , could have wakened him up and had the same speech out of him as before the Bastille fell , or old Foulon was seized ; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in Saint Antoine 's bosom .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 55]: XXIII Fire Rises There was a change on the village where the fountain fell , and where the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 58]: The prison on the crag was not so dominant as of yore ; there were soldiers to guard it , but not many ; there were officers to guard the soldiers , but not one of them knew what his men would do -- beyond this : that it would probably not be what he was ordered .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 13]: Far and wide lay a ruined country , yielding nothing but desolation .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 23]: Every green leaf , every blade of grass and blade of grain , was as shrivelled and poor as the miserable people .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 12]: Everything was bowed down , dejected , oppressed , and broken .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 24]: Habitations , fences , domesticated animals , men , women , children , and the soil that bore them -- all worn out .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 57]: Monseigneur -LRB- often a most worthy individual gentleman -RRB- was a national blessing , gave a chivalrous tone to things , was a polite example of luxurious and shining fife , and a great deal more to equal purpose ; nevertheless , Monseigneur as a class had , somehow or other , brought things to this .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 19]: Strange that Creation , designed expressly for Monseigneur , should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out !
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 12]: There must be something short-sighted in the eternal arrangements , surely !
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 60]: Thus it was , however ; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the flints , and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that its purchase crumbled , and it now turned and turned with nothing to bite , Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 19]: But , this was not the change on the village , and on many a village like it .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 60]: For scores of years gone by , Monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung it , and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures of the chase -- now , found in hunting the people ; now , found in hunting the beasts , for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 34]: The change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste , rather than in the disappearance of the high caste , chiselled , and otherwise beautified and beautifying features of Monseigneur .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 112]: For , in these times , as the mender of roads worked , solitary , in the dust , not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and to dust he must return , being for the most part too much occupied in thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if he had it -- in these times , as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour , and viewed the prospect , he would see some rough figure approaching on foot , the like of which was once a rarity in those parts , but was now a frequent presence .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 83]: As it advanced , the mender of roads would discern without surprise , that it was a shaggy-haired man , of almost barbarian aspect , tall , in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a mender of roads , grim , rough , swart , steeped in the mud and dust of many highways , dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds , sprinkled with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 43]: Such a man came upon him , like a ghost , at noon in the July weather , as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank , taking such shelter as he could get from a shower of hail .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 26]: The man looked at him , looked at the village in the hollow , at the mill , and at the prison on the crag .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 32]: When he had identified these objects in what benighted mind he had , he said , in a dialect that was just intelligible : `` How goes it , Jacques ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 7]: `` All well , Jacques . ''
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 5]: `` Touch then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 15]: They joined hands , and the man sat down on the heap of stones .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 5]: `` No dinner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 18]: `` Nothing but supper now , '' said the mender of roads , with a hungry face .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 11]: `` It is the fashion , '' growled the man .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 8]: `` I meet no dinner anywhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 58]: He took out a blackened pipe , filled it , lighted it with flint and steel , pulled at it until it was in a bright glow : then , suddenly held it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and thumb , that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 5]: `` Touch then . ''
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 20]: It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time , after observing these operations .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 5]: They again joined hands .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 4]: `` To-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 6]: said the mender of roads .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 15]: `` To-night , '' said the man , putting the pipe in his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 4]: `` Here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 42]: He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at one another , with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets , until the sky began to clear over the village .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 5]: `` Show me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 13]: said the traveller then , moving to the brow of the hill .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 4]: `` See ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 10]: returned the mender of roads , with extended finger .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 27]: `` You go down here , and straight through the street , and past the fountain -- '' `` To the Devil with all that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 11]: interrupted the other , rolling his eye over the landscape .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 11]: `` I go through no streets and past no fountains .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 3]: Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 14]: About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the village . ''
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 3]: `` Good .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 8]: When do you cease to work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 5]: `` At sunset . ''
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 9]: `` Will you wake me , before departing ?
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 8]: I have walked two nights without resting .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 14]: Let me finish my pipe , and I shall sleep like a child .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 6]: Will you wake me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 4]: `` Surely . ''
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 32]: The wayfarer smoked his pipe out , put it in his breast , slipped off his great wooden shoes , and lay down on his back on the heap of stones .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 6]: He was fast asleep directly .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 62]: As the road-mender plied his dusty labour , and the hail-clouds , rolling away , revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape , the little man -LRB- who wore a red cap now , in place of his blue one -RRB- seemed fascinated by the figure on the heap of stones .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 28]: His eyes were so often turned towards it , that he used his tools mechanically , and , one would have said , to very poor account .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 58]: The bronze face , the shaggy black hair and beard , the coarse woollen red cap , the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of beasts , the powerful frame attenuated by spare living , and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep , inspired the mender of roads with awe .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 55]: The traveller had travelled far , and his feet were footsore , and his ankles chafed and bleeding ; his great shoes , stuffed with leaves and grass , had been heavy to drag over the many long leagues , and his clothes were chafed into holes , as he himself was into sores .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 45]: Stooping down beside him , the road-mender tried to get a peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not ; but , in vain , for he slept with his arms crossed upon him , and set as resolutely as his lips .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 32]: Fortified towns with their stockades , guard-houses , gates , trenches , and drawbridges , seemed to the mender of roads , to be so much air as against this figure .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 36]: And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and looked around , he saw in his small fancy similar figures , stopped by no obstacle , tending to centres all over France .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 58]: The man slept on , indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of brightness , to sunshine on his face and shadow , to the paltering lumps of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed them , until the sun was low in the west , and the sky was glowing .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 25]: Then , the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready to go down into the village , roused him .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 4]: `` Good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 9]: said the sleeper , rising on his elbow .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 11]: `` Two leagues beyond the summit of the hill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 4]: `` About . ''
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 3]: `` About .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 3]: Good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 56]: The mender of roads went home , with the dust going on before him according to the set of the wind , and was soon at the fountain , squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink , and appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 32]: When the village had taken its poor supper , it did not creep to bed , as it usually did , but came out of doors again , and remained there .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 37]: A curious contagion of whispering was upon it , and also , when it gathered together at the fountain in the dark , another curious contagion of looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 66]: Monsieur Gabelle , chief functionary of the place , became uneasy ; went out on his house-top alone , and looked in that direction too ; glanced down from behind his chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below , and sent word to the sacristan who kept the keys of the church , that there might be need to ring the tocsin by-and-bye .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 4]: The night deepened .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 34]: The trees environing the old chateau , keeping its solitary state apart , moved in a rising wind , as though they threatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 64]: Up the two terrace flights of steps the rain ran wildly , and beat at the great door , like a swift messenger rousing those within ; uneasy rushes of wind went through the hall , among the old spears and knives , and passed lamenting up the stairs , and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis had slept .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 37]: East , West , North , and South , through the woods , four heavy-treading , unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the branches , striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 19]: Four lights broke out there , and moved away in different directions , and all was black again .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 6]: But , not for long .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 24]: Presently , the chateau began to make itself strangely visible by some light of its own , as though it were growing luminous .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 29]: Then , a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front , picking out transparent places , and showing where balustrades , arches , and windows were .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 11]: Then it soared higher , and grew broader and brighter .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 25]: Soon , from a score of the great windows , flames burst forth , and the stone faces awakened , stared out of fire .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 28]: A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left there , and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 34]: There was spurring and splashing through the darkness , and bridle was drawn in the space by the village fountain , and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur Gabelle 's door .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 5]: `` Help , Gabelle !
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 6]: Help , every one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 18]: The tocsin rang impatiently , but other help -LRB- if that were any -RRB- there was none .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 31]: The mender of roads , and two hundred and fifty particular friends , stood with folded arms at the fountain , looking at the pillar of fire in the sky .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 18]: `` It must be forty feet high , '' said they , grimly ; and never moved .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 33]: The rider from the chateau , and the horse in a foam , clattered away through the village , and galloped up the stony steep , to the prison on the crag .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 23]: At the gate , a group of officers were looking at the fire ; removed from them , a group of soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 7]: `` Help , gentlemen -- officers !
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 18]: The chateau is on fire ; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid !
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 5]: Help , help ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 32]: The officers looked towards the soldiers who looked at the fire ; gave no orders ; and answered , with shrugs and biting of lips , `` It must burn . ''
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 18]: As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street , the village was illuminating .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 45]: The mender of roads , and the two hundred and fifty particular friends , inspired as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up , had darted into their houses , and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 62]: The general scarcity of everything , occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of Monsieur Gabelle ; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that functionary 's part , the mender of roads , once so submissive to authority , had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with , and that post-horses would roast .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 11]: The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 28]: In the roaring and raging of the conflagration , a red-hot wind , driving straight from the infernal regions , seemed to be blowing the edifice away .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 20]: With the rising and falling of the blaze , the stone faces showed as if they were in torment .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 50]: When great masses of stone and timber fell , the face with the two dints in the nose became obscured : anon struggled out of the smoke again , as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis , burning at the stake and contending with the fire .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 42]: The chateau burned ; the nearest trees , laid hold of by the fire , scorched and shrivelled ; trees at a distance , fired by the four fierce figures , begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 41]: Molten lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain ; the water ran dry ; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat , and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 57]: Great rents and splits branched out in the solid walls , like crystallisation ; stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace ; four fierce figures trudged away , East , West , North , and South , along the night-enshrouded roads , guided by the beacon they had lighted , towards their next destination .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 21]: The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin , and , abolishing the lawful ringer , rang for joy .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 82]: Not only that ; but the village , light-headed with famine , fire , and bell-ringing , and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with the collection of rent and taxes -- though it was but a small instalment of taxes , and no rent at all , that Gabelle had got in those latter days -- became impatient for an interview with him , and , surrounding his house , summoned him to come forth for personal conference .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 18]: Whereupon , Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door , and retire to hold counsel with himself .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 60]: The result of that conference was , that Gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys ; this time resolved , if his door were broken in -LRB- he was a small Southern man of retaliative temperament -RRB- , to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet , and crush a man or two below .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 65]: Probably , Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there , with the distant chateau for fire and candle , and the beating at his door , combined with the joy-ringing , for music ; not to mention his having an ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate , which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 33]: A trying suspense , to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean , ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur Gabelle had resolved !
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 37]: But , the friendly dawn appearing at last , and the rush-candles of the village guttering out , the people happily dispersed , and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that while .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 82]: Within a hundred miles , and in the light of other fires , there were other functionaries less fortunate , that night and other nights , whom the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets , where they had been born and bred ; also , there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows , upon whom the functionaries and soldiery turned with success , and whom they strung up in their turn .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 30]: But , the fierce figures were steadily wending East , West , North , and South , be that as it would ; and whosoever hung , fire burned .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 29]: The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it , no functionary , by any stretch of mathematics , was able to calculate successfully .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 63]: XXIV Drawn to the Loadstone Rock In such risings of fire and risings of sea -- the firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb , but was always on the flow , higher and higher , to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the shore -- three years of tempest were consumed .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 24]: Three more birthdays of little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue of the life of her home .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 30]: Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in the corner , with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging feet .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 41]: For , the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a people , tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in danger , changed into wild beasts , by terrible enchantment long persisted in .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 44]: Monseigneur , as a class , had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of his not being appreciated : of his being so little wanted in France , as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it , and this life together .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 80]: Like the fabled rustic who raised the Devil with infinite pains , and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could ask the Enemy no question , but immediately fled ; so , Monseigneur , after boldly reading the Lord 's Prayer backwards for a great number of years , and performing many other potent spells for compelling the Evil One , no sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 25]: The shining Bull 's Eye of the Court was gone , or it would have been the mark for a hurricane of national bullets .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 44]: It had never been a good eye to see with -- had long had the mote in it of Lucifer 's pride , Sardana -- palus 's luxury , and a mole 's blindness -- but it had dropped out and was gone .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 26]: The Court , from that exclusive inner circle to its outermost rotten ring of intrigue , corruption , and dissimulation , was all gone together .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 22]: Royalty was gone ; had been besieged in its Palace and `` suspended , '' when the last tidings came over .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 25]: The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was come , and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 20]: As was natural , the head-quarters and great gathering-place of Monseigneur , in London , was Tellson 's Bank .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 28]: Spirits are supposed to haunt the places where their bodies most resorted , and Monseigneur without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 22]: Moreover , it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most to be relied upon , came quickest .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 24]: Again : Tellson 's was a munificent house , and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high estate .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 39]: Again : those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time , and anticipating plunder or confiscation , had made provident remittances to Tellson 's , were always to be heard of there by their needy brethren .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 27]: To which it must be added that every new-comer from France reported himself and his tidings at Tellson 's , almost as a matter of course .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 77]: For such variety of reasons , Tellson 's was at that time , as to French intelligence , a kind of High Exchange ; and this was so well known to the public , and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous , that Tellson 's sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it in the Bank windows , for all who ran through Temple Bar to read .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 30]: On a steaming , misty afternoon , Mr. Lorry sat at his desk , and Charles Darnay stood leaning on it , talking with him in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 25]: The penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House , was now the news -- Exchange , and was filled to overflowing .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 14]: It was within half an hour or so of the time of closing .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 34]: `` But , although you are the youngest man that ever lived , '' said Charles Darnay , rather hesitating , `` I must still suggest to you -- '' `` I understand .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 7]: That I am too old ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 4]: said Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 29]: `` Unsettled weather , a long journey , uncertain means of travelling , a disorganised country , a city that may not be even safe for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 31]: `` My dear Charles , '' said Mr. Lorry , with cheerful confidence , `` you touch some of the reasons for my going : not for my staying away .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 33]: It is safe enough for me ; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth interfering with .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 50]: As to its being a disorganised city , if it were not a disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our House here to our House there , who knows the city and the business , of old , and is in Tellson 's confidence .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 45]: As to the uncertain travelling , the long journey , and the winter weather , if I were not prepared to submit myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellson 's , after all these years , who ought to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 22]: `` I wish I were going myself , '' said Charles Darnay , somewhat restlessly , and like one thinking aloud .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 11]: You are a pretty fellow to object and advise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 4]: exclaimed Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 8]: `` You wish you were going yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 6]: And you a Frenchman born ?
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 7]: You are a wise counsellor . ''
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 37]: `` My dear Mr. Lorry , it is because I am a Frenchman born , that the thought -LRB- which I did not mean to utter here , however -RRB- has passed through my mind often .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 51]: One can not help thinking , having had some sympathy for the miserable people , and having abandoned something to them , '' he spoke here in his former thoughtful manner , `` that one might be listened to , and might have the power to persuade to some restraint .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 31]: Only last night , after you had left us , when I was talking to Lucie -- '' `` When you were talking to Lucie , '' Mr. Lorry repeated .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 13]: I wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie !
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 13]: Wishing you were going to France at this time of day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 17]: `` However , I am not going , '' said Charles Darnay , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 14]: `` It is more to the purpose that you say you are . ''
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 9]: `` And I am , in plain reality .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 53]: The truth is , my dear Charles , '' Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House , and lowered his voice , `` you can have no conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted , and of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 53]: The Lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers of people , if some of our documents were seized or destroyed ; and they might be , at any time , you know , for who can say that Paris is not set afire to-day , or sacked to-morrow !
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 52]: Now , a judicious selection from these with the least possible delay , and the burying of them , or otherwise getting of them out of harm 's way , is within the power -LRB- without loss of precious time -RRB- of scarcely any one but myself , if any one .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 37]: And shall I hang back , when Tellson 's knows this and says this -- Tellson 's , whose bread I have eaten these sixty years -- because I am a little stiff about the joints ?
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 18]: Why , I am a boy , sir , to half a dozen old codgers here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 15]: `` How I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit , Mr. Lorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 3]: `` Tut !
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 4]: Nonsense , sir !
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 46]: -- And , my dear Charles , '' said Mr. Lorry , glancing at the House again , `` you are to remember , that getting things out of Paris at this present time , no matter what things , is next to an impossibility .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 59]: Papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here -LRB- I speak in strict confidence ; it is not business-like to whisper it , even to you -RRB- , by the strangest bearers you can imagine , every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed the Barriers .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 27]: At another time , our parcels would come and go , as easily as in business-like Old England ; but now , everything is stopped . ''
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 9]: `` And do you really go to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 19]: `` I really go to-night , for the case has become too pressing to admit of delay . ''
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 11]: `` And do you take no one with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 23]: `` All sorts of people have been proposed to me , but I will have nothing to say to any of them .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 6]: I intend to take Jerry .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 20]: Jerry has been my bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 31]: Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog , or of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his master . ''
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 15]: `` I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and youthfulness . ''
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 10]: `` I must say again , nonsense , nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 25]: When I have executed this little commission , I shall , perhaps , accept Tellson 's proposal to retire and live at my ease .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 12]: Time enough , then , to think about growing old . ''
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 38]: This dialogue had taken place at Mr. Lorry 's usual desk , with Monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it , boastful of what he would do to avenge himself on the rascal-people before long .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 117]: It was too much the way of Monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee , and it was much too much the way of native British orthodoxy , to talk of this terrible Revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under the skies that had not been sown -- as if nothing had ever been done , or omitted to be done , that had led to it -- as if observers of the wretched millions in France , and of the misused and perverted resources that should have made them prosperous , had not seen it inevitably coming , years before , and had not in plain words recorded what they saw .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 52]: Such vapouring , combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself , and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself , was hard to be endured without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 45]: And it was such vapouring all about his ears , like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head , added to a latent uneasiness in his mind , which had already made Charles Darnay restless , and which still kept him so .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 82]: Among the talkers , was Stryver , of the King 's Bench Bar , far on his way to state promotion , and , therefore , loud on the theme : broaching to Monseigneur , his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth , and doing without them : and for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 47]: Him , Darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection ; and Darnay stood divided between going away that he might hear no more , and remaining to interpose his word , when the thing that was to be , went on to shape itself out .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 33]: The House approached Mr. Lorry , and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him , asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed ?
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 27]: The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay that he saw the direction -- the more quickly because it was his own right name .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 13]: The address , turned into English , ran : `` Very pressing .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 11]: To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde , of France .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 17]: Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co. , Bankers , London , England . ''
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 44]: On the marriage morning , Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and express request to Charles Darnay , that the secret of this name should be -- unless he , the Doctor , dissolved the obligation -- kept inviolate between them .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 25]: Nobody else knew it to be his name ; his own wife had no suspicion of the fact ; Mr. Lorry could have none .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 43]: `` No , '' said Mr. Lorry , in reply to the House ; `` I have referred it , I think , to everybody now here , and no one can tell me where this gentleman is to be found . ''
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 30]: The hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank , there was a general set of the current of talkers past Mr. Lorry 's desk .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 70]: He held the letter out inquiringly ; and Monseigneur looked at it , in the person of this plotting and indignant refugee ; and Monseigneur looked at it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee ; and This , That , and The Other , all had something disparaging to say , in French or in English , concerning the Marquis who was not to be found .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 25]: `` Nephew , I believe -- but in any case degenerate successor -- of the polished Marquis who was murdered , '' said one .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 11]: `` Happy to say , I never knew him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 39]: `` A craven who abandoned his post , '' said another -- this Monseigneur had been got out of Paris , legs uppermost and half suffocated , in a load of hay -- `` some years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 47]: `` Infected with the new doctrines , '' said a third , eyeing the direction through his glass in passing ; `` set himself in opposition to the last Marquis , abandoned the estates when he inherited them , and left them to the ruffian herd .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 14]: They will recompense him now , I hope , as he deserves . ''
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 4]: `` Hey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 5]: cried the blatant Stryver .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 5]: `` Did he though ?
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 7]: Is that the sort of fellow ?
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 8]: Let us look at his infamous name .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 7]: D -- n the fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 26]: Darnay , unable to restrain himself any longer , touched Mr. Stryver on the shoulder , and said : `` I know the fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 8]: `` Do you , by Jupiter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 3]: said Stryver .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 8]: `` I am sorry for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 6]: `` Why , Mr. Darnay ?
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 6]: D'ye hear what he did ?
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 11]: Do n't ask , why , in these times . ''
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 8]: `` But I do ask why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 16]: `` Then I tell you again , Mr. Darnay , I am sorry for it .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 12]: I am sorry to hear you putting any such extraordinary questions .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 56]: Here is a fellow , who , infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that ever was known , abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth that ever did murder by wholesale , and you ask me why I am sorry that a man who instructs youth knows him ?
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 8]: Well , but I 'll answer you .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 14]: I am sorry because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 5]: That 's why . ''
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 24]: Mindful of the secret , Darnay with great difficulty checked himself , and said : `` You may not understand the gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 26]: `` I understand how to put YOU in a corner , Mr. Darnay , '' said Bully Stryver , `` and I 'll do it .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 13]: If this fellow is a gentleman , I DO N'T understand him .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 10]: You may tell him so , with my compliments .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 33]: You may also tell him , from me , that after abandoning his worldly goods and position to this butcherly mob , I wonder he is not at the head of them .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 52]: But , no , gentlemen , '' said Stryver , looking all round , and snapping his fingers , `` I know something of human nature , and I tell you that you 'll never find a fellow like this fellow , trusting himself to the mercies of such precious PROTEGES .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 25]: No , gentlemen ; he 'll always show 'em a clean pair of heels very early in the scuffle , and sneak away . ''
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 27]: With those words , and a final snap of his fingers , Mr. Stryver shouldered himself into Fleet-street , amidst the general approbation of his hearers .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 20]: Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk , in the general departure from the Bank .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 10]: `` Will you take charge of the letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 4]: said Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 9]: `` You know where to deliver it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 5]: `` I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 38]: `` Will you undertake to explain , that we suppose it to have been addressed here , on the chance of our knowing where to forward it , and that it has been here some time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 6]: `` I will do so .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 9]: Do you start for Paris from here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 8]: `` From here , at eight . ''
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 12]: `` I will come back , to see you off . ''
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 37]: Very ill at ease with himself , and with Stryver and most other men , Darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the Temple , opened the letter , and read it .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 13]: These were its contents : `` Prison of the Abbaye , Paris .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 6]: `` June 21 , 1792 .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 6]: `` MONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 38]: `` After having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the village , I have been seized , with great violence and indignity , and brought a long journey on foot to Paris .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 10]: On the road I have suffered a great deal .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 16]: Nor is that all ; my house has been destroyed -- razed to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 63]: `` The crime for which I am imprisoned , Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal , and shall lose my life -LRB- without your so generous help -RRB- , is , they tell me , treason against the majesty of the people , in that I have acted against them for an emigrant .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 22]: It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them , and not against , according to your commands .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 42]: It is in vain I represent that , before the sequestration of emigrant property , I had remitted the imposts they had ceased to pay ; that I had collected no rent ; that I had had recourse to no process .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 19]: The only response is , that I have acted for an emigrant , and where is that emigrant ?
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 12]: most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , where is that emigrant ?
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 9]: I cry in my sleep where is he ?
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 13]: I demand of Heaven , will he not come to deliver me ?
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 3]: No answer .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 32]: Ah Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , I send my desolate cry across the sea , hoping it may perhaps reach your ears through the great bank of Tilson known at Paris !
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 36]: `` For the love of Heaven , of justice , of generosity , of the honour of your noble name , I supplicate you , Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , to succour and release me .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 12]: My fault is , that I have been true to you .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 15]: Oh Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , I pray you be you true to me !
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 37]: `` From this prison here of horror , whence I every hour tend nearer and nearer to destruction , I send you , Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , the assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 8]: `` Your afflicted , `` Gabelle . ''
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 16]: The latent uneasiness in Darnay 's mind was roused to vigourous life by this letter .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 55]: The peril of an old servant and a good one , whose only crime was fidelity to himself and his family , stared him so reproachfully in the face , that , as he walked to and fro in the Temple considering what to do , he almost hid his face from the passersby .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 59]: He knew very well , that in his horror of the deed which had culminated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house , in his resentful suspicions of his uncle , and in the aversion with which his conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold , he had acted imperfectly .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 35]: He knew very well , that in his love for Lucie , his renunciation of his social place , though by no means new to his own mind , had been hurried and incomplete .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 32]: He knew that he ought to have systematically worked it out and supervised it , and that he had meant to do it , and that it had never been done .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 89]: The happiness of his own chosen English home , the necessity of being always actively employed , the swift changes and troubles of the time which had followed on one another so fast , that the events of this week annihilated the immature plans of last week , and the events of the week following made all new again ; he knew very well , that to the force of these circumstances he had yielded : -- not without disquiet , but still without continuous and accumulating resistance .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 81]: That he had watched the times for a time of action , and that they had shifted and struggled until the time had gone by , and the nobility were trooping from France by every highway and byway , and their property was in course of confiscation and destruction , and their very names were blotting out , was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in France that might impeach him for it .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 61]: But , he had oppressed no man , he had imprisoned no man ; he was so far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues , that he had relinquished them of his own will , thrown himself on a world with no favour in it , won his own private place there , and earned his own bread .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 84]: Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate on written instructions , to spare the people , to give them what little there was to give -- such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have in the winter , and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in the summer -- and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof , for his own safety , so that it could not but appear now .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 19]: This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make , that he would go to Paris .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 36]: Like the mariner in the old story , the winds and streams had driven him within the influence of the Loadstone Rock , and it was drawing him to itself , and he must go .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 24]: Everything that arose before his mind drifted him on , faster and faster , more and more steadily , to the terrible attraction .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 59]: His latent uneasiness had been , that bad aims were being worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments , and that he who could not fail to know that he was better than they , was not there , trying to do something to stay bloodshed , and assert the claims of mercy and humanity .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 72]: With this uneasiness half stifled , and half reproaching him , he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong ; upon that comparison -LRB- injurious to himself -RRB- had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur , which had stung him bitterly , and those of Stryver , which above all were coarse and galling , for old reasons .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 31]: Upon those , had followed Gabelle 's letter : the appeal of an innocent prisoner , in danger of death , to his justice , honour , and good name .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 5]: His resolution was made .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 6]: He must go to Paris .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 17]: The Loadstone Rock was drawing him , and he must sail on , until he struck .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 12]: He knew of no rock ; he saw hardly any danger .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 42]: The intention with which he had done what he had done , even although he had left it incomplete , presented it before him in an aspect that would be gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert it .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 49]: Then , that glorious vision of doing good , which is so often the sanguine mirage of so many good minds , arose before him , and he even saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging Revolution that was running so fearfully wild .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 28]: As he walked to and fro with his resolution made , he considered that neither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 50]: Lucie should be spared the pain of separation ; and her father , always reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old , should come to the knowledge of the step , as a step taken , and not in the balance of suspense and doubt .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 36]: How much of the incompleteness of his situation was referable to her father , through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind , he did not discuss with himself .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 14]: But , that circumstance too , had had its influence in his course .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 27]: He walked to and fro , with thoughts very busy , until it was time to return to Tellson 's and take leave of Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 26]: As soon as he arrived in Paris he would present himself to this old friend , but he must say nothing of his intention now .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 18]: A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door , and Jerry was booted and equipped .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 15]: `` I have delivered that letter , '' said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 24]: `` I would not consent to your being charged with any written answer , but perhaps you will take a verbal one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 21]: `` That I will , and readily , '' said Mr. Lorry , `` if it is not dangerous . ''
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 5]: `` Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 11]: Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye . ''
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 7]: `` What is his name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 12]: said Mr. Lorry , with his open pocket-book in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 4]: `` Gabelle . ''
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 3]: `` Gabelle .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 13]: And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 17]: `` Simply , ` that he has received the letter , and will come . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 6]: `` Any time mentioned ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 11]: `` He will start upon his journey to-morrow night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 6]: `` Any person mentioned ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 36]: He helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks , and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank , into the misty air of Fleet-street .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 31]: `` My love to Lucie , and to little Lucie , '' said Mr. Lorry at parting , `` and take precious care of them till I come back . ''
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 15]: Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled , as the carriage rolled away .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 93]: That night -- it was the fourteenth of August -- he sat up late , and wrote two fervent letters ; one was to Lucie , explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to Paris , and showing her , at length , the reasons that he had , for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there ; the other was to the Doctor , confiding Lucie and their dear child to his care , and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 21]: To both , he wrote that he would despatch letters in proof of his safety , immediately after his arrival .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 25]: It was a hard day , that day of being among them , with the first reservation of their joint lives on his mind .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 17]: It was a hard matter to preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 55]: But , an affectionate glance at his wife , so happy and busy , made him resolute not to tell her what impended -LRB- he had been half moved to do it , so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid -RRB- , and the day passed quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 58]: Early in the evening he embraced her , and her scarcely less dear namesake , pretending that he would return by-and-bye -LRB- an imaginary engagement took him out , and he had secreted a valise of clothes ready -RRB- , and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy streets , with a heavier heart .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 26]: The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself , now , and all the tides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 33]: He left his two letters with a trusty porter , to be delivered half an hour before midnight , and no sooner ; took horse for Dover ; and began his journey .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 22]: `` For the love of Heaven , of justice , of generosity , of the honour of your noble name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 34]: was the poor prisoner 's cry with which he strengthened his sinking heart , as he left all that was dear on earth behind him , and floated away for the Loadstone Rock .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 7]: The end of the second book .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 39]: Book the Third -- the Track of a Storm I In Secret The traveller fared slowly on his way , who fared towards Paris from England in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 53]: More than enough of bad roads , bad equipages , and bad horses , he would have encountered to delay him , though the fallen and unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory ; but , the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 91]: Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of citizen-patriots , with their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness , who stopped all comers and goers , cross-questioned them , inspected their papers , looked for their names in lists of their own , turned them back , or sent them on , or stopped them and laid them in hold , as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning Republic One and Indivisible , of Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 42]: A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished , when Charles Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen at Paris .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 14]: Whatever might befall now , he must on to his journey 's end .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 39]: Not a mean village closed upon him , not a common barrier dropped across the road behind him , but he knew it to be another iron door in the series that was barred between him and England .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 39]: The universal watchfulness so encompassed him , that if he had been taken in a net , or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage , he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 53]: This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty times in a stage , but retarded his progress twenty times in a day , by riding after him and taking him back , riding before him and stopping him by anticipation , riding with him and keeping him in charge .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 35]: He had been days upon his journey in France alone , when he went to bed tired out , in a little town on the high road , still a long way from Paris .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 24]: Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle 's letter from his prison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 25]: His difficulty at the guard-house in this small place had been such , that he felt his journey to have come to a crisis .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 39]: And he was , therefore , as little surprised as a man could be , to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he had been remitted until morning , in the middle of the night .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 28]: Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough red caps and with pipes in their mouths , who sat down on the bed .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 24]: `` Emigrant , '' said the functionary , `` I am going to send you on to Paris , under an escort . ''
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 22]: `` Citizen , I desire nothing more than to get to Paris , though I could dispense with the escort . ''
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 4]: `` Silence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 15]: growled a red-cap , striking at the coverlet with the butt-end of his musket .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 6]: `` Peace , aristocrat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 15]: `` It is as the good patriot says , '' observed the timid functionary .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 19]: `` You are an aristocrat , and must have an escort -- and must pay for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 11]: `` I have no choice , '' said Charles Darnay .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 3]: `` Choice !
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 5]: Listen to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 6]: cried the same scowling red-cap .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 16]: `` As if it was not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 15]: `` It is always as the good patriot says , '' observed the functionary .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 9]: `` Rise and dress yourself , emigrant . ''
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 30]: Darnay complied , and was taken back to the guard-house , where other patriots in rough red caps were smoking , drinking , and sleeping , by a watch-fire .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 29]: Here he paid a heavy price for his escort , and hence he started with it on the wet , wet roads at three o'clock in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 29]: The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured cockades , armed with national muskets and sabres , who rode one on either side of him .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 31]: The escorted governed his own horse , but a loose line was attached to his bridle , the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his wrist .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 34]: In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their faces : clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement , and out upon the mire-deep roads .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 26]: In this state they traversed without change , except of horses and pace , all the mire-deep leagues that lay between them and the capital .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 22]: They travelled in the night , halting an hour or two after daybreak , and lying by until the twilight fell .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 27]: The escort were so wretchedly clothed , that they twisted straw round their bare legs , and thatched their ragged shoulders to keep the wet off .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 100]: Apart from the personal discomfort of being so attended , and apart from such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk , and carrying his musket very recklessly , Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast ; for , he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated , and of representations , confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye , that were not yet made .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 39]: But when they came to the town of Beauvais -- which they did at eventide , when the streets were filled with people -- he could not conceal from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 26]: An ominous crowd gathered to see him dismount of the posting-yard , and many voices called out loudly , `` Down with the emigrant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 30]: He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle , and , resuming it as his safest place , said : `` Emigrant , my friends !
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 16]: Do you not see me here , in France , of my own will ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 36]: `` You are a cursed emigrant , '' cried a farrier , making at him in a furious manner through the press , hammer in hand ; `` and you are a cursed aristocrat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 34]: The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider 's bridle -LRB- at which he was evidently making -RRB- , and soothingly said , `` Let him be ; let him be !
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 8]: He will be judged at Paris . ''
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 4]: `` Judged ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 8]: repeated the farrier , swinging his hammer .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 3]: `` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 7]: and condemned as a traitor . ''
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 7]: At this the crowd roared approval .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 60]: Checking the postmaster , who was for turning his horse 's head to the yard -LRB- the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on , with the line round his wrist -RRB- , Darnay said , as soon as he could make his voice heard : `` Friends , you deceive yourselves , or you are deceived .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 7]: I am not a traitor . ''
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 5]: `` He lies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 4]: cried the smith .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 9]: `` He is a traitor since the decree .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 8]: His life is forfeit to the people .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 9]: His cursed life is not his own ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 55]: At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd , which another instant would have brought upon him , the postmaster turned his horse into the yard , the escort rode in close upon his horse 's flanks , and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 23]: The farrier struck a blow upon them with his hammer , and the crowd groaned ; but , no more was done .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 12]: `` What is this decree that the smith spoke of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 19]: Darnay asked the postmaster , when he had thanked him , and stood beside him in the yard .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 13]: `` Truly , a decree for selling the property of emigrants . ''
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 5]: `` When passed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 6]: `` On the fourteenth . ''
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 8]: `` The day I left England ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 33]: `` Everybody says it is but one of several , and that there will be others -- if there are not already-banishing all emigrants , and condemning all to death who return .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 16]: That is what he meant when he said your life was not your own . ''
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 10]: `` But there are no such decrees yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 7]: `` What do I know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 18]: said the postmaster , shrugging his shoulders ; `` there may be , or there will be .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 6]: It is all the same .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 6]: What would you have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 27]: They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night , and then rode forward again when all the town was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 26]: Among the many wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride unreal , not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 68]: After long and lonely spurring over dreary roads , they would come to a cluster of poor cottages , not steeped in darkness , but all glittering with lights , and would find the people , in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night , circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty , or all drawn up together singing a Liberty song .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 86]: Happily , however , there was sleep in Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more into solitude and loneliness : jingling through the untimely cold and wet , among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth that year , diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses , and by the sudden emergence from ambuscade , and sharp reining up across their way , of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 11]: Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 14]: The barrier was closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 10]: `` Where are the papers of this prisoner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 15]: demanded a resolute-looking man in authority , who was summoned out by the guard .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 49]: Naturally struck by the disagreeable word , Charles Darnay requested the speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen , in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had imposed upon him , and which he had paid for .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 26]: `` Where , '' repeated the same personage , without taking any heed of him whatever , `` are the papers of this prisoner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 13]: The drunken patriot had them in his cap , and produced them .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 28]: Casting his eyes over Gabelle 's letter , the same personage in authority showed some disorder and surprise , and looked at Darnay with a close attention .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 29]: He left escort and escorted without saying a word , however , and went into the guard-room ; meanwhile , they sat upon their horses outside the gate .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 72]: Looking about him while in this state of suspense , Charles Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and patriots , the latter far outnumbering the former ; and that while ingress into the city for peasants ' carts bringing in supplies , and for similar traffic and traffickers , was easy enough , egress , even for the homeliest people , was very difficult .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 42]: A numerous medley of men and women , not to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts , was waiting to issue forth ; but , the previous identification was so strict , that they filtered through the barrier very slowly .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 36]: Some of these people knew their turn for examination to be so far off , that they lay down on the ground to sleep or smoke , while others talked together , or loitered about .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 15]: The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal , both among men and women .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 36]: When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour , taking note of these things , Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority , who directed the guard to open the barrier .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 23]: Then he delivered to the escort , drunk and sober , a receipt for the escorted , and requested him to dismount .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 23]: He did so , and the two patriots , leading his tired horse , turned and rode away without entering the city .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 49]: He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room , smelling of common wine and tobacco , where certain soldiers and patriots , asleep and awake , drunk and sober , and in various neutral states between sleeping and waking , drunkenness and sobriety , were standing and lying about .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 30]: The light in the guard-house , half derived from the waning oil-lamps of the night , and half from the overcast day , was in a correspondingly uncertain condition .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 23]: Some registers were lying open on a desk , and an officer of a coarse , dark aspect , presided over these .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 23]: `` Citizen Defarge , '' said he to Darnay 's conductor , as he took a slip of paper to write on .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 8]: `` Is this the emigrant Evremonde ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 7]: `` This is the man . ''
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 7]: `` Your age , Evremonde ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 4]: `` Thirty-seven . ''
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 6]: `` Married , Evremonde ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 5]: `` Where married ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 5]: `` In England . ''
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 4]: `` Without doubt .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 8]: Where is your wife , Evremonde ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 5]: `` In England . ''
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 4]: `` Without doubt .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 14]: You are consigned , Evremonde , to the prison of La Force . ''
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 5]: `` Just Heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 3]: exclaimed Darnay .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 11]: `` Under what law , and for what offence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 13]: The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 18]: `` We have new laws , Evremonde , and new offences , since you were here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 13]: He said it with a hard smile , and went on writing .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 27]: `` I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily , in response to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before you .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 13]: I demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 7]: Is not that my right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 14]: `` Emigrants have no rights , Evremonde , '' was the stolid reply .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 34]: The officer wrote until he had finished , read over to himself what he had written , sanded it , and handed it to Defarge , with the words `` In secret . ''
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 14]: Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany him .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 14]: The prisoner obeyed , and a guard of two armed patriots attended them .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 47]: `` Is it you , '' said Defarge , in a low voice , as they went down the guardhouse steps and turned into Paris , `` who married the daughter of Doctor Manette , once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' replied Darnay , looking at him with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 17]: `` My name is Defarge , and I keep a wine-shop in the Quarter Saint Antoine .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 8]: Possibly you have heard of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 12]: `` My wife came to your house to reclaim her father ?
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 3]: Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 44]: The word `` wife '' seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge , to say with sudden impatience , `` In the name of that sharp female newly-born , and called La Guillotine , why did you come to France ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 11]: `` You heard me say why , a minute ago .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 10]: Do you not believe it is the truth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 22]: `` A bad truth for you , '' said Defarge , speaking with knitted brows , and looking straight before him .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 7]: `` Indeed I am lost here .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 20]: All here is so unprecedented , so changed , so sudden and unfair , that I am absolutely lost .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 9]: Will you render me a little help ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 4]: `` None . ''
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 9]: Defarge spoke , always looking straight before him .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 10]: `` Will you answer me a single question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 3]: `` Perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 5]: According to its nature .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 8]: You can say what it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 24]: `` In this prison that I am going to so unjustly , shall I have some free communication with the world outside ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 6]: `` You will see . ''
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 21]: `` I am not to be buried there , prejudged , and without any means of presenting my case ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 5]: `` You will see .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 5]: But , what then ?
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 14]: Other people have been similarly buried in worse prisons , before now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 10]: `` But never by me , Citizen Defarge . ''
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 18]: Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer , and walked on in a steady and set silence .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 27]: The deeper he sank into this silence , the fainter hope there was -- or so Darnay thought -- of his softening in any slight degree .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 78]: He , therefore , made haste to say : `` It is of the utmost importance to me -LRB- you know , Citizen , even better than I , of how much importance -RRB- , that I should be able to communicate to Mr. Lorry of Tellson 's Bank , an English gentleman who is now in Paris , the simple fact , without comment , that I have been thrown into the prison of La Force .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 11]: Will you cause that to be done for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 15]: `` I will do , '' Defarge doggedly rejoined , `` nothing for you .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 10]: My duty is to my country and the People .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 11]: I am the sworn servant of both , against you .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 8]: I will do nothing for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 17]: Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further , and his pride was touched besides .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 27]: As they walked on in silence , he could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 7]: The very children scarcely noticed him .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 50]: A few passers turned their heads , and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat ; otherwise , that a man in good clothes should be going to prison , was no more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be going to work .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 43]: In one narrow , dark , and dirty street through which they passed , an excited orator , mounted on a stool , was addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people , of the king and the royal family .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 38]: The few words that he caught from this man 's lips , first made it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison , and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 14]: On the road -LRB- except at Beauvais -RRB- he had heard absolutely nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 11]: The escort and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated him .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 25]: That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had developed themselves when he left England , he of course knew now .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 22]: That perils had thickened about him fast , and might thicken faster and faster yet , he of course knew now .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 28]: He could not but admit to himself that he might not have made this journey , if he could have foreseen the events of a few days .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 23]: And yet his misgivings were not so dark as , imagined by the light of this later time , they would appear .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 21]: Troubled as the future was , it was the unknown future , and in its obscurity there was ignorant hope .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 53]: The horrible massacre , days and nights long , which , within a few rounds of the clock , was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed garnering time of harvest , was as far out of his knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand years away .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 28]: The `` sharp female newly-born , and called La Guillotine , '' was hardly known to him , or to the generality of people , by name .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 23]: The frightful deeds that were to be soon done , were probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 15]: How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind ?
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 37]: Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship , and in cruel separation from his wife and child , he foreshadowed the likelihood , or the certainty ; but , beyond this , he dreaded nothing distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 26]: With this on his mind , which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard , he arrived at the prison of La Force .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 21]: A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket , to whom Defarge presented `` The Emigrant Evremonde . ''
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 5]: `` What the Devil !
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 7]: How many more of them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 8]: exclaimed the man with the bloated face .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 17]: Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation , and withdrew , with his two fellow-patriots .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 10]: `` What the Devil , I say again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 9]: exclaimed the gaoler , left with his wife .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 6]: `` How many more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 27]: The gaoler 's wife , being provided with no answer to the question , merely replied , `` One must have patience , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 37]: Three turnkeys who entered responsive to a bell she rang , echoed the sentiment , and one added , `` For the love of Liberty ; '' which sounded in that place like an inappropriate conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 25]: The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison , dark and filthy , and with a horrible smell of foul sleep in it .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 22]: Extraordinary how soon the noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep , becomes manifest in all such places that are ill cared for !
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 17]: `` In secret , too , '' grumbled the gaoler , looking at the written paper .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 12]: `` As if I was not already full to bursting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 61]: He stuck the paper on a file , in an ill-humour , and Charles Darnay awaited his further pleasure for half an hour : sometimes , pacing to and fro in the strong arched room : sometimes , resting on a stone seat : in either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his subordinates .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 4]: `` Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 19]: said the chief , at length taking up his keys , `` come with me , emigrant . ''
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 43]: Through the dismal prison twilight , his new charge accompanied him by corridor and staircase , many doors clanging and locking behind them , until they came into a large , low , vaulted chamber , crowded with prisoners of both sexes .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 40]: The women were seated at a long table , reading and writing , knitting , sewing , and embroidering ; the men were for the most part standing behind their chairs , or lingering up and down the room .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 19]: In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and disgrace , the new-comer recoiled from this company .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 42]: But the crowning unreality of his long unreal ride , was , their all at once rising to receive him , with every refinement of manner known to the time , and with all the engaging graces and courtesies of life .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 43]: So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and gloom , so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and misery through which they were seen , that Charles Darnay seemed to stand in a company of the dead .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 3]: Ghosts all !
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 67]: The ghost of beauty , the ghost of stateliness , the ghost of elegance , the ghost of pride , the ghost of frivolity , the ghost of wit , the ghost of youth , the ghost of age , all waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore , all turning on him eyes that were changed by the death they had died in coming there .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 5]: It struck him motionless .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 85]: The gaoler standing at his side , and the other gaolers moving about , who would have been well enough as to appearance in the ordinary exercise of their functions , looked so extravagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were there -- with the apparitions of the coquette , the young beauty , and the mature woman delicately bred -- that the inversion of all experience and likelihood which the scene of shadows presented , was heightened to its utmost .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 5]: Surely , ghosts all .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 19]: Surely , the long unreal ride some progress of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades !
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 52]: `` In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune , '' said a gentleman of courtly appearance and address , coming forward , `` I have the honour of giving you welcome to La Force , and of condoling with you on the calamity that has brought you among us .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 6]: May it soon terminate happily !
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 22]: It would be an impertinence elsewhere , but it is not so here , to ask your name and condition ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 20]: Charles Darnay roused himself , and gave the required information , in words as suitable as he could find .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 33]: `` But I hope , '' said the gentleman , following the chief gaoler with his eyes , who moved across the room , `` that you are not in secret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 20]: `` I do not understand the meaning of the term , but I have heard them say so . ''
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 7]: `` Ah , what a pity !
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 6]: We so much regret it !
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 27]: But take courage ; several members of our society have been in secret , at first , and it has lasted but a short time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 20]: Then he added , raising his voice , `` I grieve to inform the society -- in secret . ''
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 46]: There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him , and many voices -- among which , the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous -- gave him good wishes and encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 32]: He turned at the grated door , to render the thanks of his heart ; it closed under the gaoler 's hand ; and the apparitions vanished from his sight forever .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 11]: The wicket opened on a stone staircase , leading upward .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 34]: When they bad ascended forty steps -LRB- the prisoner of half an hour already counted them -RRB- , the gaoler opened a low black door , and they passed into a solitary cell .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 11]: It struck cold and damp , but was not dark .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 8]: `` Yours , '' said the gaoler .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 8]: `` Why am I confined alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 7]: `` How do I know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 12]: `` I can buy pen , ink , and paper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 7]: `` Such are not my orders .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 10]: You will be visited , and can ask then .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 14]: At present , you may buy your food , and nothing more . ''
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 17]: There were in the cell , a chair , a table , and a straw mattress .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 68]: As the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects , and of the four walls , before going out , a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him , that this gaoler was so unwholesomely bloated , both in face and person , as to look like a man who had been drowned and filled with water .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 27]: When the gaoler was gone , he thought in the same wandering way , `` Now am I left , as if I were dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 40]: Stopping then , to look down at the mattress , he turned from it with a sick feeling , and thought , `` And here in these crawling creatures is the first condition of the body after death . ''
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 26]: `` Five paces by four and a half , five paces by four and a half , five paces by four and a half . ''
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 34]: The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell , counting its measurement , and the roar of the city arose like muffled drums with a wild swell of voices added to them .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 14]: `` He made shoes , he made shoes , he made shoes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 22]: The prisoner counted the measurement again , and paced faster , to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 10]: `` The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 62]: There was one among them , the appearance of a lady dressed in black , who was leaning in the embrasure of a window , and she had a light shining upon her golden hair , and she looked like ... Let us ride on again , for God 's sake , through the illuminated villages with the people all awake !
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 22]: ... He made shoes , he made shoes , he made shoes ... Five paces by four and a half . ''
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 64]: With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of his mind , the prisoner walked faster and faster , obstinately counting and counting ; and the roar of the city changed to this extent -- that it still rolled in like muffled drums , but with the wail of voices that he knew , in the swell that rose above them .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 44]: II The Grindstone Tellson 's Bank , established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris , was in a wing of a large house , approached by a courtyard and shut off from the street by a high wall and a strong gate .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 34]: The house belonged to a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the troubles , in his own cook 's dress , and got across the borders .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 43]: A mere beast of the chase flying from hunters , he was still in his metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur , the preparation of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in question .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 63]: Monseigneur gone , and the three strong men absolving themselves from the sin of having drawn his high wages , by being more than ready and willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and indivisible of Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death , Monseigneur 's house had been first sequestrated , and then confiscated .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 60]: For , all things moved so fast , and decree followed decree with that fierce precipitation , that now upon the third night of the autumn month of September , patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of Monseigneur 's house , and had marked it with the tri-colour , and were drinking brandy in its state apartments .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 30]: A place of business in London like Tellson 's place of business in Paris , would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 29]: For , what would staid British responsibility and respectability have said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard , and even to a Cupid over the counter ?
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 5]: Yet such things were .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 38]: Tellson 's had whitewashed the Cupid , but he was still to be seen on the ceiling , in the coolest linen , aiming -LRB- as he very often does -RRB- at money from morning to night .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 57]: Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan , in Lombard-street , London , and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of the immortal boy , and also of a looking-glass let into the wall , and also of clerks not at all old , who danced in public on the slightest provocation .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 39]: Yet , a French Tellson 's could get on with these things exceedingly well , and , as long as the times held together , no man had taken fright at them , and drawn out his money .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 94]: What money would be drawn out of Tellson 's henceforth , and what would lie there , lost and forgotten ; what plate and jewels would tarnish in Tellson 's hiding-places , while the depositors rusted in prisons , and when they should have violently perished ; how many accounts with Tellson 's never to be balanced in this world , must be carried over into the next ; no man could have said , that night , any more than Mr. Jarvis Lorry could , though he thought heavily of these questions .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 51]: He sat by a newly-lighted wood fire -LRB- the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold -RRB- , and on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw , or any object in the room distortedly reflect -- a shade of horror .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 27]: He occupied rooms in the Bank , in his fidelity to the House of which he had grown to be a part , lie strong root-ivy .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 28]: it chanced that they derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main building , but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about that .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 15]: All such circumstances were indifferent to him , so that he did his duty .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 30]: On the opposite side of the courtyard , under a colonnade , was extensive standing -- for carriages -- where , indeed , some carriages of Monseigneur yet stood .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 52]: Against two of the pillars were fastened two great flaring flambeaux , and in the light of these , standing out in the open air , was a large grindstone : a roughly mounted thing which appeared to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy , or other workshop .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 24]: Rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects , Mr. Lorry shivered , and retired to his seat by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 31]: He had opened , not only the glass window , but the lattice blind outside it , and he had closed both again , and he shivered through his frame .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 51]: From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate , there came the usual night hum of the city , with now and then an indescribable ring in it , weird and unearthly , as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible nature were going up to Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 29]: `` Thank God , '' said Mr. Lorry , clasping his hands , `` that no one near and dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 12]: May He have mercy on all who are in danger ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 22]: Soon afterwards , the bell at the great gate sounded , and he thought , `` They have come back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 4]: and sat listening .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 29]: But , there was no loud irruption into the courtyard , as he had expected , and he heard the gate clash again , and all was quiet .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 29]: The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague uneasiness respecting the Bank , which a great change would naturally awaken , with such feelings roused .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 42]: It was well guarded , and he got up to go among the trusty people who were watching it , when his door suddenly opened , and two figures rushed in , at sight of which he fell back in amazement .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 5]: Lucie and her father !
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 49]: Lucie with her arms stretched out to him , and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified , that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 6]: `` What is this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 8]: cried Mr. Lorry , breathless and confused .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 6]: `` What is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 2]: Lucie !
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 2]: Manette !
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 4]: What has happened ?
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 6]: What has brought you here ?
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 28]: With the look fixed upon him , in her paleness and wildness , she panted out in his arms , imploringly , `` O my dear friend !
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 4]: My husband ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 7]: `` Your husband , Lucie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 4]: `` Charles . ''
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 6]: `` What of Charles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 3]: `` Here .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 7]: `` Here , in Paris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 25]: `` Has been here some days -- three or four -- I do n't know how many -- I ca n't collect my thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 24]: An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us ; he was stopped at the barrier , and sent to prison . ''
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 8]: The old man uttered an irrepressible cry .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 29]: Almost at the same moment , the beg of the great gate rang again , and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 7]: `` What is that noise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 9]: said the Doctor , turning towards the window .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 6]: `` Do n't look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 4]: cried Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 6]: `` Do n't look out !
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 13]: Manette , for your life , do n't touch the blind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 38]: The Doctor turned , with his hand upon the fastening of the window , and said , with a cool , bold smile : `` My dear friend , I have a charmed life in this city .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 7]: I have been a Bastille prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 10]: There is no patriot in Paris -- in Paris ?
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 33]: In France -- who , knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille , would touch me , except to overwhelm me with embraces , or carry me in triumph .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 29]: My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the barrier , and gained us news of Charles there , and brought us here .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 23]: I knew it would be so ; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger ; I told Lucie so .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 7]: -- What is that noise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 8]: His hand was again upon the window .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 6]: `` Do n't look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 7]: cried Mr. Lorry , absolutely desperate .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 12]: `` No , Lucie , my dear , nor you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 11]: He got his arm round her , and held her .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 10]: `` Do n't be so terrified , my love .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 30]: I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm having happened to Charles ; that I had no suspicion even of his being in this fatal place .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 7]: What prison is he in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 5]: `` La Force ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 4]: `` La Force !
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 51]: Lucie , my child , if ever you were brave and serviceable in your life -- and you were always both -- you will compose yourself now , to do exactly as I bid you ; for more depends upon it than you can think , or I can say .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 21]: There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night ; you can not possibly stir out .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 26]: I say this , because what I must bid you to do for Charles 's sake , is the hardest thing to do of all .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 11]: You must instantly be obedient , still , and quiet .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 14]: You must let me put you in a room at the back here .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 28]: You must leave your father and me alone for two minutes , and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not delay . ''
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 8]: `` I will be submissive to you .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 16]: I see in your face that you know I can do nothing else than this .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 7]: I know you are true . ''
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 56]: The old man kissed her , and hurried her into his room , and turned the key ; then , came hurrying back to the Doctor , and opened the window and partly opened the blind , and put his hand upon the Doctor 's arm , and looked out with him into the courtyard .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 33]: Looked out upon a throng of men and women : not enough in number , or near enough , to fill the courtyard : not more than forty or fifty in all .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 45]: The people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate , and they had rushed in to work at the grindstone ; it had evidently been set up there for their purpose , as in a convenient and retired spot .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 11]: But , such awful workers , and such awful work !
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 55]: The grindstone had a double handle , and , turning at it madly were two men , whose faces , as their long hair Rapped back when the whirlings of the grindstone brought their faces up , were more horrible and cruel than the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 39]: False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them , and their hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty , and all awry with howling , and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 70]: As these ruffians turned and turned , their matted locks now flung forward over their eyes , now flung backward over their necks , some women held wine to their mouths that they might drink ; and what with dropping blood , and what with dropping wine , and what with the stream of sparks struck out of the stone , all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and fire .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 17]: The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from the smear of blood .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 66]: Shouldering one another to get next at the sharpening-stone , were men stripped to the waist , with the stain all over their limbs and bodies ; men in all sorts of rags , with the stain upon those rags ; men devilishly set off with spoils of women 's lace and silk and ribbon , with the stain dyeing those trifles through and through .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 20]: Hatchets , knives , bayonets , swords , all brought to be sharpened , were all red with it .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 38]: Some of the hacked swords were tied to the wrists of those who carried them , with strips of linen and fragments of dress : ligatures various in kind , but all deep of the one colour .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 54]: And as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream of sparks and tore away into the streets , the same red hue was red in their frenzied eyes ; -- eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have given twenty years of life , to petrify with a well-directed gun .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 36]: All this was seen in a moment , as the vision of a drowning man , or of any human creature at any very great pass , could see a world if it were there .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 20]: They drew back from the window , and the Doctor looked for explanation in his friend 's ashy face .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 24]: `` They are , '' Mr. Lorry whispered the words , glancing fearfully round at the locked room , `` murdering the prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 40]: If you are sure of what you say ; if you really have the power you think you have -- as I believe you have -- make yourself known to these devils , and get taken to La Force .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 21]: It may be too late , I do n't know , but let it not be a minute later ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 25]: Doctor Manette pressed his hand , hastened bareheaded out of the room , and was in the courtyard when Mr. Lorry regained the blind .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 41]: His streaming white hair , his remarkable face , and the impetuous confidence of his manner , as he put the weapons aside like water , carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 71]: For a few moments there was a pause , and a hurry , and a murmur , and the unintelligible sound of his voice ; and then Mr. Lorry saw him , surrounded by all , and in the midst of a line of twenty men long , all linked shoulder to shoulder , and hand to shoulder , hurried out with cries of -- `` Live the Bastille prisoner !
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 11]: Help for the Bastille prisoner 's kindred in La Force !
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 9]: Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there !
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 9]: Save the prisoner Evremonde at La Force ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 6]: and a thousand answering shouts .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 41]: He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart , closed the window and the curtain , hastened to Lucie , and told her that her father was assisted by the people , and gone in search of her husband .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 42]: He found her child and Miss Pross with her ; but , it never occurred to him to be surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards , when he sat watching them in such quiet as the night knew .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 23]: Lucie had , by that time , fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet , clinging to his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 26]: Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own bed , and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 15]: O the long , long night , with the moans of the poor wife !
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 18]: And O the long , long night , with no return of her father and no tidings !
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 26]: Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded , and the irruption was repeated , and the grindstone whirled and spluttered .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 5]: cried Lucie , affrighted .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 3]: `` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 13]: The soldiers ' swords are sharpened there , '' said Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 20]: `` The place is national property now , and used as a kind of armoury , my love . ''
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 17]: Twice more in all ; but , the last spell of work was feeble and fitful .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 24]: Soon afterwards the day began to dawn , and he softly detached himself from the clasping hand , and cautiously looked out again .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 45]: A man , so besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back to consciousness on a field of slain , was rising from the pavement by the side of the grindstone , and looking about him with a vacant air .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 44]: Shortly , this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of the carriages of Monseigneur , and , staggering to that gorgeous vehicle , climbed in at the door , and shut himself up to take his rest on its dainty cushions .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 24]: The great grindstone , Earth , had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again , and the sun was red on the courtyard .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 32]: But , the lesser grindstone stood alone there in the calm morning air , with a red upon it that the sun had never given , and would never take away .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 98]: III The Shadow One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr. Lorry when business hours came round , was this : -- that he had no right to imperil Tellson 's by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under the Bank roof , His own possessions , safety , life , he would have hazarded for Lucie and her child , without a moment 's demur ; but the great trust he held was not his own , and as to that business charge he was a strict man of business .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 38]: At first , his mind reverted to Defarge , and he thought of finding out the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 33]: But , the same consideration that suggested him , repudiated him ; he lived in the most violent Quarter , and doubtless was influential there , and deep in its dangerous workings .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 26]: Noon coming , and the Doctor not returning , and every minute 's delay tending to compromise Tellson 's , Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 24]: She said that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term , in that Quarter , near the Banking-house .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 82]: As there was no business objection to this , and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles , and he were to be released , he could not hope to leave the city , Mr. Lorry went out in quest of such a lodging , and found a suitable one , high up in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 31]: To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child , and Miss Pross : giving them what comfort he could , and much more than he had himself .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 29]: He left Jerry with them , as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear considerable knocking on the head , and retained to his own occupations .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 23]: A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them , and slowly and heavily the day lagged on with him .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 17]: It wore itself out , and wore him out with it , until the Bank closed .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 27]: He was again alone in his room of the previous night , considering what to do next , when he heard a foot upon the stair .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 28]: In a few moments , a man stood in his presence , who , with a keenly observant look at him , addressed him by his name .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 9]: `` Your servant , '' said Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 7]: `` Do you know me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 19]: He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair , from forty-five to fifty years of age .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 21]: For answer he repeated , without any change of emphasis , the words : `` Do you know me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 8]: `` I have seen you somewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 7]: `` Perhaps at my wine-shop ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 17]: Much interested and agitated , Mr. Lorry said : `` You come from Doctor Manette ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 7]: I come from Doctor Manette . ''
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 6]: `` And what says he ?
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 7]: What does he send me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 13]: Defarge gave into his anxious hand , an open scrap of paper .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 25]: It bore the words in the Doctor 's writing : `` Charles is safe , but I can not safely leave this place yet .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 18]: I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note from Charles to his wife .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 8]: Let the bearer see his wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 11]: It was dated from La Force , within an hour .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 27]: `` Will you accompany me , '' said Mr. Lorry , joyfully relieved after reading this note aloud , `` to where his wife resides ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' returned Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 30]: Scarcely noticing as yet , in what a curiously reserved and mechanical way Defarge spoke , Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went down into the courtyard .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 11]: There , they found two women ; one , knitting .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 7]: `` Madame Defarge , surely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 18]: said Mr. Lorry , who had left her in exactly the same attitude some seventeen years ago .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 10]: `` It is she , '' observed her husband .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 8]: `` Does Madame go with us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 12]: inquired Mr. Lorry , seeing that she moved as they moved .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 14]: That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 7]: It is for their safety . ''
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 21]: Beginning to be struck by Defarge 's manner , Mr. Lorry looked dubiously at him , and led the way .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 12]: Both the women followed ; the second woman being The Vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 32]: They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might , ascended the staircase of the new domicile , were admitted by Jerry , and found Lucie weeping , alone .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 52]: She was thrown into a transport by the tidings Mr. Lorry gave her of her husband , and clasped the hand that delivered his note -- little thinking what it had been doing near him in the night , and might , but for a chance , have done to him .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 7]: `` DEAREST , -- Take courage .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 12]: I am well , and your father has influence around me .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 6]: You can not answer this .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 7]: Kiss our child for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 6]: That was all the writing .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 31]: It was so much , however , to her who received it , that she turned from Defarge to his wife , and kissed one of the hands that knitted .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 31]: It was a passionate , loving , thankful , womanly action , but the hand made no response -- dropped cold and heavy , and took to its knitting again .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 12]: There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 29]: She stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom , and , with her hands yet at her neck , looked terrified at Madame Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 15]: Madame Defarge met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold , impassive stare .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 68]: `` My dear , '' said Mr. Lorry , striking in to explain ; `` there are frequent risings in the streets ; and , although it is not likely they will ever trouble you , Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at such times , to the end that she may know them -- that she may identify them .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 41]: I believe , '' said Mr. Lorry , rather halting in his reassuring words , as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more , `` I state the case , Citizen Defarge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 19]: Defarge looked gloomily at his wife , and gave no other answer than a gruff sound of acquiescence .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 36]: `` You had better , Lucie , '' said Mr. Lorry , doing all he could to propitiate , by tone and manner , `` have the dear child here , and our good Pross .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 17]: Our good Pross , Defarge , is an English lady , and knows no French . ''
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 58]: The lady in question , whose rooted conviction that she was more than a match for any foreigner , was not to be shaken by distress and , danger , appeared with folded arms , and observed in English to The Vengeance , whom her eyes first encountered , `` Well , I am sure , Boldface !
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 8]: I hope YOU are pretty well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 22]: She also bestowed a British cough on Madame Defarge ; but , neither of the two took much heed of her .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 7]: `` Is that his child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 29]: said Madame Defarge , stopping in her work for the first time , and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it were the finger of Fate .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 25]: `` Yes , madame , '' answered Mr. Lorry ; `` this is our poor prisoner 's darling daughter , and only child . ''
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 38]: The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child , that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her , and held her to her breast .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 26]: The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall , threatening and dark , on both the mother and the child .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 13]: `` It is enough , my husband , '' said Madame Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 6]: `` I have seen them .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 5]: We may go . ''
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 50]: But , the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it -- not visible and presented , but indistinct and withheld -- to alarm Lucie into saying , as she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge 's dress : `` You will be good to my poor husband .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 7]: You will do him no harm .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 12]: You will help me to see him if you can ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 22]: `` Your husband is not my business here , '' returned Madame Defarge , looking down at her with perfect composure .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 15]: `` It is the daughter of your father who is my business here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 13]: `` For my sake , then , be merciful to my husband .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 6]: For my child 's sake !
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 13]: She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 12]: We are more afraid of you than of these others . ''
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 14]: Madame Defarge received it as a compliment , and looked at her husband .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 22]: Defarge , who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her , collected his face into a sterner expression .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 14]: `` What is it that your husband says in that little letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 9]: asked Madame Defarge , with a lowering smile .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 10]: `` Influence ; he says something touching influence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 38]: `` That my father , '' said Lucie , hurriedly taking the paper from her breast , but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it , `` has much influence around him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 8]: `` Surely it will release him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 4]: said Madame Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 7]: `` Let it do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 46]: `` As a wife and mother , '' cried Lucie , most earnestly , `` I implore you to have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess , against my innocent husband , but to use it in his behalf .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 7]: O sister-woman , think of me .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 7]: As a wife and mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 53]: Madame Defarge looked , coldly as ever , at the suppliant , and said , turning to her friend The Vengeance : `` The wives and mothers we have been used to see , since we were as little as this child , and much less , have not been greatly considered ?
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 18]: We have known THEIR husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them , often enough ?
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 38]: All our lives , we have seen our sister-women suffer , in themselves and in their children , poverty , nakedness , hunger , thirst , sickness , misery , oppression and neglect of all kinds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 12]: `` We have seen nothing else , '' returned The Vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 21]: `` We have borne this a long time , '' said Madame Defarge , turning her eyes again upon Lucie .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 4]: `` Judge you !
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 19]: Is it likely that the trouble of one wife and mother would be much to us now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 8]: She resumed her knitting and went out .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 4]: The Vengeance followed .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 9]: Defarge went last , and closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 17]: `` Courage , my dear Lucie , '' said Mr. Lorry , as he raised her .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 5]: `` Courage , courage !
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 23]: So far all goes well with us -- much , much better than it has of late gone with many poor souls .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 10]: Cheer up , and have a thankful heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 27]: `` I am not thankless , I hope , but that dreadful woman seems to throw a shadow on me and on all my hopes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 6]: `` Tut , tut ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 15]: said Mr. Lorry ; `` what is this despondency in the brave little breast ?
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 4]: A shadow indeed !
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 8]: No substance in it , Lucie . ''
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 28]: But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself , for all that , and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 20]: IV Calm in Storm Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his absence .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 88]: So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her , that not until long afterwards , when France and she were far apart , did she know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all ages had been killed by the populace ; that four days and nights had been darkened by this deed of horror ; and that the air around her had been tainted by the slain .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 35]: She only knew that there had been an attack upon the prisons , that all political prisoners had been in danger , and that some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 39]: To Mr. Lorry , the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on which he had no need to dwell , that the crowd had taken him through a scene of carnage to the prison of La Force .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 56]: That , in the prison he had found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting , before which the prisoners were brought singly , and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth to be massacred , or to be released , or -LRB- in a few cases -RRB- to be sent back to their cells .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 56]: That , presented by his conductors to this Tribunal , he had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille ; that , one of the body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him , and that this man was Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 61]: That , hereupon he had ascertained , through the registers on the table , that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners , and had pleaded hard to the Tribunal -- of whom some members were asleep and some awake , some dirty with murder and some clean , some sober and some not -- for his life and liberty .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 38]: That , in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as a notable sufferer under the overthrown system , it had been accorded to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court , and examined .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 42]: That , he seemed on the point of being at once released , when the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check -LRB- not intelligible to the Doctor -RRB- , which led to a few words of secret conference .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 34]: That , the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that the prisoner must remain in custody , but should , for his sake , be held inviolate in safe custody .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 88]: That , immediately , on a signal , the prisoner was removed to the interior of the prison again ; but , that he , the Doctor , had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and assure himself that his son-in-law was , through no malice or mischance , delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had often drowned the proceedings , that he had obtained the permission , and had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 21]: The sights he had seen there , with brief snatches of food and sleep by intervals , shall remain untold .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 27]: The mad joy over the prisoners who were saved , had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against those who were cut to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 32]: One prisoner there was , he said , who had been discharged into the street free , but at whom a mistaken savage had thrust a pike as he passed out .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 44]: Being besought to go to him and dress the wound , the Doctor had passed out at the same gate , and had found him in the arms of a company of Samaritans , who were seated on the bodies of their victims .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 77]: With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this awful nightmare , they had helped the healer , and tended the wounded man with the gentlest solicitude -- had made a litter for him and escorted him carefully from the spot -- had then caught up their weapons and plunged anew into a butchery so dreadful , that the Doctor had covered his eyes with his hands , and swooned away in the midst of it .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 37]: As Mr. Lorry received these confidences , and as he watched the face of his friend now sixty-two years of age , a misgiving arose within him that such dread experiences would revive the old danger .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 25]: But , he had never seen his friend in his present aspect : he had never at all known him in his present character .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 18]: For the first time the Doctor felt , now , that his suffering was strength and power .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 34]: For the first time he felt that in that sharp fire , he had slowly forged the iron which could break the prison door of his daughter 's husband , and deliver him .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 20]: `` It all tended to a good end , my friend ; it was not mere waste and ruin .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 38]: As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself , I will be helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her ; by the aid of Heaven I will do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 5]: Thus , Doctor Manette .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 64]: And when Jarvis Lorry saw the kindled eyes , the resolute face , the calm strong look and bearing of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped , like a clock , for so many years , and then set going again with an energy which had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness , he believed .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 21]: Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with , would have yielded before his persevering purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 59]: While he kept himself in his place , as a physician , whose business was with all degrees of mankind , bond and free , rich and poor , bad and good , he used his personal influence so wisely , that he was soon the inspecting physician of three prisons , and among them of La Force .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 103]: He could now assure Lucie that her husband was no longer confined alone , but was mixed with the general body of prisoners ; he saw her husband weekly , and brought sweet messages to her , straight from his lips ; sometimes her husband himself sent a letter to her -LRB- though never by the Doctor 's hand -RRB- , but she was not permitted to write to him : for , among the many wild suspicions of plots in the prisons , the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 32]: This new life of the Doctor 's was an anxious life , no doubt ; still , the sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 22]: Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride ; it was a natural and worthy one ; but he observed it as a curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 35]: The Doctor knew , that up to that time , his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter and his friend , with his personal affliction , deprivation , and weakness .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 64]: Now that this was changed , and he knew himself to be invested through that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles 's ultimate safety and deliverance , he became so far exalted by the change , that he took the lead and direction , and required them as the weak , to trust to him as the strong .
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 45]: The preceding relative positions of himself and Lucie were reversed , yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could reverse them , for he could have had no pride but in rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 47]: `` All curious to see , '' thought Mr. Lorry , in his amiably shrewd way , `` but all natural and right ; so , take the lead , my dear friend , and keep it ; it could n't be in better hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 45]: But , though the Doctor tried hard , and never ceased trying , to get Charles Darnay set at liberty , or at least to get him brought to trial , the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 163]: The new era began ; the king was tried , doomed , and beheaded ; the Republic of Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death , declared for victory or death against the world in arms ; the black flag waved night and day from the great towers of Notre Dame ; three hundred thousand men , summoned to rise against the tyrants of the earth , rose from all the varying soils of France , as if the dragon 's teeth had been sown broadcast , and had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain , on rock , in gravel , and alluvial mud , under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of the North , in fell and forest , in the vineyards and the olive-grounds and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn , along the fruitful banks of the broad rivers , and in the sand of the sea-shore .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 38]: What private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the Year One of Liberty -- the deluge rising from below , not falling from above , and with the windows of Heaven shut , not opened !
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 22]: There was no pause , no pity , no peace , no interval of relenting rest , no measurement of time .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 31]: Though days and nights circled as regularly as when time was young , and the evening and morning were the first day , other count of time there was none .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 23]: Hold of it was lost in the raging fever of a nation , as it is in the fever of one patient .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 56]: Now , breaking the unnatural silence of a whole city , the executioner showed the people the head of the king -- and now , it seemed almost in the same breath , the head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned widowhood and misery , to turn it grey .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 28]: And yet , observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in all such cases , the time was long , while it flamed by so fast .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 91]: A revolutionary tribunal in the capital , and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees all over the land ; a law of the Suspected , which struck away all security for liberty or life , and delivered over any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one ; prisons gorged with people who had committed no offence , and could obtain no hearing ; these things became the established order and nature of appointed things , and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 35]: Above all , one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before the general gaze from the foundations of the world -- the figure of the sharp female called La Guillotine .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 59]: It was the popular theme for jests ; it was the best cure for headache , it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey , it imparted a peculiar delicacy to the complexion , it was the National Razor which shaved close : who kissed La Guillotine , looked through the little window and sneezed into the sack .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 12]: It was the sign of the regeneration of the human race .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 5]: It superseded the Cross .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 29]: Models of it were worn on breasts from which the Cross was discarded , and it was bowed down to and believed in where the Cross was denied .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 22]: It sheared off heads so many , that it , and the ground it most polluted , were a rotten red .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 25]: It was taken to pieces , like a toy-puzzle for a young Devil , and was put together again when the occasion wanted it .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 16]: It hushed the eloquent , struck down the powerful , abolished the beautiful and good .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 29]: Twenty-two friends of high public mark , twenty-one living and one dead , it had lopped the heads off , in one morning , in as many minutes .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 47]: The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief functionary who worked it ; but , so armed , he was stronger than his namesake , and blinder , and tore away the gates of God 's own Temple every day .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 42]: Among these terrors , and the brood belonging to them , the Doctor walked with a steady head : confident in his power , cautiously persistent in his end , never doubting that he would save Lucie 's husband at last .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 42]: Yet the current of the time swept by , so strong and deep , and carried the time away so fiercely , that Charles had lain in prison one year and three months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 47]: So much more wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December month , that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the violently drowned by night , and prisoners were shot in lines and squares under the southern wintry sun .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 13]: Still , the Doctor walked among the terrors with a steady head .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 20]: No man better known than he , in Paris at that day ; no man in a stranger situation .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 25]: Silent , humane , indispensable in hospital and prison , using his art equally among assassins and victims , he was a man apart .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 23]: In the exercise of his skill , the appearance and the story of the Bastille Captive removed him from all other men .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 33]: He was not suspected or brought in question , any more than if he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before , or were a Spirit moving among mortals .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 11]: V The Wood -- Sawyer One year and three months .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 28]: During all that time Lucie was never sure , from hour to hour , but that the Guillotine would strike off her husband 's head next day .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 18]: Every day , through the stony streets , the tumbrils now jolted heavily , filled with Condemned .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 60]: Lovely girls ; bright women , brown-haired , black-haired , and grey ; youths ; stalwart men and old ; gentle born and peasant born ; all red wine for La Guillotine , all daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons , and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 22]: Liberty , equality , fraternity , or death ; -- the last , much the easiest to bestow , O Guillotine !
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 42]: If the suddenness of her calamity , and the whirling wheels of the time , had stunned the Doctor 's daughter into awaiting the result in idle despair , it would but have been with her as it was with many .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 32]: But , from the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in the garret of Saint Antoine , she had been true to her duties .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 22]: She was truest to them in the season of trial , as all the quietly loyal and good will always be .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 38]: As soon as they were established in their new residence , and her father had entered on the routine of his avocations , she arranged the little household as exactly as if her husband had been there .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 10]: Everything had its appointed place and its appointed time .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 20]: Little Lucie she taught , as regularly , as if they had all been united in their English home .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 77]: The slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief that they would soon be reunited -- the little preparations for his speedy return , the setting aside of his chair and his books -- these , and the solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially , among the many unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death -- were almost the only outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 8]: She did not greatly alter in appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 33]: The plain dark dresses , akin to mourning dresses , which she and her child wore , were as neat and as well attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 30]: She lost her colour , and the old and intent expression was a constant , not an occasional , thing ; otherwise , she remained very pretty and comely .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 36]: Sometimes , at night on kissing her father , she would burst into the grief she had repressed all day , and would say that her sole reliance , under Heaven , was on him .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 27]: He always resolutely answered : `` Nothing can happen to him without my knowledge , and I know that I can save him , Lucie . ''
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 52]: They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks , when her father said to her , on coming home one evening : `` My dear , there is an upper window in the prison , to which Charles can sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 39]: When he can get to it -- which depends on many uncertainties and incidents -- he might see you in the street , he thinks , if you stood in a certain place that I can show you .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 34]: But you will not be able to see him , my poor child , and even if you could , it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition . ''
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 19]: `` O show me the place , my father , and I will go there every day . ''
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 14]: From that time , in all weathers , she waited there two hours .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 18]: As the clock struck two , she was there , and at four she turned resignedly away .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 36]: When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her , they went together ; at other times she was alone ; but , she never missed a single day .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 13]: It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 25]: The hovel of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning , was the only house at that end ; all else was wall .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 13]: On the third day of her being there , he noticed her .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 7]: `` Good day , citizeness . ''
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 7]: `` Good day , citizen . ''
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 10]: This mode of address was now prescribed by decree .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 23]: It had been established voluntarily some time ago , among the more thorough patriots ; but , was now law for everybody .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 8]: `` Walking here again , citizeness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 8]: `` You see me , citizen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 53]: The wood-sawyer , who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture -LRB- he had once been a mender of roads -RRB- , cast a glance at the prison , pointed at the prison , and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent bars , peeped through them jocosely .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 12]: `` But it 's not my business , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 7]: And went on sawing his wood .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 17]: Next day he was looking out for her , and accosted her the moment she appeared .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 3]: `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 7]: Walking here again , citizeness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 6]: `` Yes , citizen . ''
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 4]: A child too !
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 12]: Your mother , is it not , my little citizeness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 9]: `` Do I say yes , mamma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 9]: whispered little Lucie , drawing close to her .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 6]: `` Yes , dearest . ''
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 6]: `` Yes , citizen . ''
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 7]: But it 's not my business .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 6]: My work is my business .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 4]: See my saw !
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 7]: I call it my Little Guillotine .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 12]: La , la , la ; La , la , la !
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 7]: And off his head comes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 15]: The billet fell as he spoke , and he threw it into a basket .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 11]: `` I call myself the Samson of the firewood guillotine .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 4]: See here again !
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 12]: Loo , loo , loo ; Loo , loo , loo !
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 6]: And off HER head comes !
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 5]: Now , a child .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 8]: Tickle , tickle ; Pickle , pickle !
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 6]: And off ITS head comes .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 5]: All the family ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 33]: Lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket , but it was impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work , and not be in his sight .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 26]: Thenceforth , to secure his good will , she always spoke to him first , and often gave him drink-money , which he readily received .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 59]: He was an inquisitive fellow , and sometimes when she had quite forgotten him in gazing at the prison roof and grates , and in lifting her heart up to her husband , she would come to herself to find him looking at her , with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 9]: `` But it 's not my business ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 17]: he would generally say at those times , and would briskly fall to his sawing again .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 66]: In all weathers , in the snow and frost of winter , in the bitter winds of spring , in the hot sunshine of summer , in the rains of autumn , and again in the snow and frost of winter , Lucie passed two hours of every day at this place ; and every day on leaving it , she kissed the prison wall .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 43]: Her husband saw her -LRB- so she learned from her father -RRB- it might be once in five or six times : it might be twice or thrice running : it might be , not for a week or a fortnight together .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 32]: It was enough that he could and did see her when the chances served , and on that possibility she would have waited out the day , seven days a week .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 22]: These occupations brought her round to the December month , wherein her father walked among the terrors with a steady head .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 11]: On a lightly-snowing afternoon she arrived at the usual corner .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 13]: It was a day of some wild rejoicing , and a festival .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 50]: She had seen the houses , as she came along , decorated with little pikes , and with little red caps stuck upon them ; also , with tricoloured ribbons ; also , with the standard inscription -LRB- tricoloured letters were the favourite -RRB- , Republic One and Indivisible .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 9]: Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death !
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 22]: The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small , that its whole surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 23]: He had got somebody to scrawl it up for him , however , who had squeezed Death in with most inappropriate difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 46]: On his house-top , he displayed pike and cap , as a good citizen must , and in a window he had stationed his saw inscribed as his `` Little Sainte Guillotine '' -- for the great sharp female was by that time popularly canonised .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 23]: His shop was shut and he was not there , which was a relief to Lucie , and left her quite alone .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 27]: But , he was not far off , for presently she heard a troubled movement and a shouting coming along , which filled her with fear .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 34]: A moment afterwards , and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the prison wall , in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with The Vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 19]: There could not be fewer than five hundred people , and they were dancing like five thousand demons .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 10]: There was no other music than their own singing .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 22]: They danced to the popular Revolution song , keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 21]: Men and women danced together , women danced together , men danced together , as hazard had brought them together .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 45]: At first , they were a mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags ; but , as they filled the place , and stopped to dance about Lucie , some ghastly apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 38]: They advanced , retreated , struck at one another 's hands , clutched at one another 's heads , spun round alone , caught one another and spun round in pairs , until many of them dropped .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 65]: While those were down , the rest linked hand in hand , and all spun round together : then the ring broke , and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they all stopped at once , began again , struck , clutched , and tore , and then reversed the spin , and all spun round another way .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 40]: Suddenly they stopped again , paused , struck out the time afresh , formed into lines the width of the public way , and , with their heads low down and their hands high up , swooped screaming off .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 12]: No fight could have been half so terrible as this dance .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 41]: It was so emphatically a fallen sport -- a something , once innocent , delivered over to all devilry -- a healthy pastime changed into a means of angering the blood , bewildering the senses , and steeling the heart .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 26]: Such grace as was visible in it , made it the uglier , showing how warped and perverted all things good by nature were become .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 34]: The maidenly bosom bared to this , the pretty almost-child 's head thus distracted , the delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt , were types of the disjointed time .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 5]: This was the Carmagnole .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 38]: As it passed , leaving Lucie frightened and bewildered in the doorway of the wood-sawyer 's house , the feathery snow fell as quietly and lay as white and soft , as if it had never been .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 6]: `` O my father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 28]: for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she had momentarily darkened with her hand ; `` such a cruel , bad sight . ''
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 10]: `` I know , my dear , I know .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 7]: I have seen it many times .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 5]: Do n't be frightened !
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 9]: Not one of them would harm you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 11]: `` I am not frightened for myself , my father .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 27]: But when I think of my husband , and the mercies of these people -- '' `` We will set him above their mercies very soon .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 15]: I left him climbing to the window , and I came to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 8]: There is no one here to see .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 12]: You may kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof . ''
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 17]: `` I do so , father , and I send him my Soul with it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 12]: `` You can not see him , my poor dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 22]: `` No , father , '' said Lucie , yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand , `` no . ''
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 6]: A footstep in the snow .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 3]: Madame Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 12]: `` I salute you , citizeness , '' from the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 8]: `` I salute you , citizen . ''
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 4]: This in passing .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 3]: Nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 12]: Madame Defarge gone , like a shadow over the white road .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 9]: `` Give me your arm , my love .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 15]: Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness and courage , for his sake .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 20]: That was well done ; '' they had left the spot ; `` it shall not be in vain .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 7]: Charles is summoned for to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 5]: `` For to-morrow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 8]: `` There is no time to lose .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 27]: I am well prepared , but there are precautions to be taken , that could not be taken until he was actually summoned before the Tribunal .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 31]: He has not received the notice yet , but I know that he will presently be summoned for to-morrow , and removed to the Conciergerie ; I have timely information .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 6]: You are not afraid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 12]: She could scarcely answer , `` I trust in you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 6]: `` Do so , implicitly .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 28]: Your suspense is nearly ended , my darling ; he shall be restored to you within a few hours ; I have encompassed him with every protection .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 6]: I must see Lorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 3]: He stopped .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 10]: There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 9]: They both knew too well what it meant .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 2]: One .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 2]: Two .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 2]: Three .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 13]: Three tumbrils faring away with their dread loads over the hushing snow .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 16]: `` I must see Lorry , '' the Doctor repeated , turning her another way .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 15]: The staunch old gentleman was still in his trust ; had never left it .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 16]: He and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated and made national .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 11]: What he could save for the owners , he saved .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 21]: No better man living to hold fast by what Tellson 's had in keeping , and to hold his peace .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 21]: A murky red and yellow sky , and a rising mist from the Seine , denoted the approach of darkness .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 11]: It was almost dark when they arrived at the Bank .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 11]: The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted and deserted .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 18]: Above a heap of dust and ashes in the court , ran the letters : National Property .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 5]: Republic One and Indivisible .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 9]: Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death !
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 23]: Who could that be with Mr. Lorry -- the owner of the riding-coat upon the chair -- who must not be seen ?
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 22]: From whom newly arrived , did he come out , agitated and surprised , to take his favourite in his arms ?
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 47]: To whom did he appear to repeat her faltering words , when , raising his voice and turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued , he said : `` Removed to the Conciergerie , and summoned for to-morrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 20]: VI Triumph The dread tribunal of five Judges , Public Prosecutor , and determined Jury , sat every day .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 22]: Their lists went forth every evening , and were read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 20]: The standard gaoler-joke was , `` Come out and listen to the Evening Paper , you inside there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 8]: `` Charles Evremonde , called Darnay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 11]: So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 25]: When a name was called , its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 21]: Charles Evremonde , called Darnay , had reason to know the usage ; he had seen hundreds pass away so .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 39]: His bloated gaoler , who wore spectacles to read with , glanced over them to assure himself that he had taken his place , and went through the list , making a similar short pause at each name .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 36]: There were twenty-three names , but only twenty were responded to ; for one of the prisoners so summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten , and two had already been guillotined and forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 23]: The list was read , in the vaulted chamber where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his arrival .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 28]: Every one of those had perished in the massacre ; every human creature he had since cared for and parted with , had died on the scaffold .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 16]: There were hurried words of farewell and kindness , but the parting was soon over .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 33]: It was the incident of every day , and the society of La Force were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little concert , for that evening .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 59]: They crowded to the grates and shed tears there ; but , twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be refilled , and the time was , at best , short to the lock-up hour , when the common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs who kept watch there through the night .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 20]: The prisoners were far from insensible or unfeeling ; their ways arose out of the condition of the time .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 53]: Similarly , though with a subtle difference , a species of fervour or intoxication , known , without doubt , to have led some persons to brave the guillotine unnecessarily , and to die by it , was not mere boastfulness , but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 26]: In seasons of pestilence , some of us will have a secret attraction to the disease -- a terrible passing inclination to die of it .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 19]: And all of us have like wonders hidden in our breasts , only needing circumstances to evoke them .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 21]: The passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark ; the night in its vermin-haunted cells was long and cold .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 18]: Next day , fifteen prisoners were put to the bar before Charles Darnay 's name was called .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 19]: All the fifteen were condemned , and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 13]: `` Charles Evremonde , called Darnay , '' was at length arraigned .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 24]: His judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats ; but the rough red cap and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 32]: Looking at the Jury and the turbulent audience , he might have thought that the usual order of things was reversed , and that the felons were trying the honest men .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 50]: The lowest , cruelest , and worst populace of a city , never without its quantity of low , cruel , and bad , were the directing spirits of the scene : noisily commenting , applauding , disapproving , anticipating , and precipitating the result , without a check .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 36]: Of the men , the greater part were armed in various ways ; of the women , some wore knives , some daggers , some ate and drank as they looked on , many knitted .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 20]: Among these last , was one , with a spare piece of knitting under her arm as she worked .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 33]: She was in a front row , by the side of a man whom he had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier , but whom he directly remembered as Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 53]: He noticed that she once or twice whispered in his ear , and that she seemed to be his wife ; but , what he most noticed in the two figures was , that although they were posted as close to himself as they could be , they never looked towards him .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 24]: They seemed to be waiting for something with a dogged determination , and they looked at the Jury , but at nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 13]: Under the President sat Doctor Manette , in his usual quiet dress .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 40]: As well as the prisoner could see , he and Mr. Lorry were the only men there , unconnected with the Tribunal , who wore their usual clothes , and had not assumed the coarse garb of the Carmagnole .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 36]: Charles Evremonde , called Darnay , was accused by the public prosecutor as an emigrant , whose life was forfeit to the Republic , under the decree which banished all emigrants on pain of Death .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 14]: It was nothing that the decree bore date since his return to France .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 23]: There he was , and there was the decree ; he had been taken in France , and his head was demanded .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 7]: `` Take off his head ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 4]: cried the audience .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 8]: `` An enemy to the Republic ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 28]: The President rang his bell to silence those cries , and asked the prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in England ?
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 4]: Undoubtedly it was .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 7]: Was he not an emigrant then ?
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 6]: What did he call himself ?
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 16]: Not an emigrant , he hoped , within the sense and spirit of the law .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 3]: Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 6]: the President desired to know .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 66]: Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to him , and a station that was distasteful to him , and had left his country -- he submitted before the word emigrant in the present acceptation by the Tribunal was in use -- to live by his own industry in England , rather than on the industry of the overladen people of France .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 7]: What proof had he of this ?
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 16]: He handed in the names of two witnesses ; Theophile Gabelle , and Alexandre Manette .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 7]: But he had married in England ?
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 5]: the President reminded him .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 8]: True , but not an English woman .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 5]: A citizeness of France ?
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 3]: By birth .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 5]: Her name and family ?
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 18]: `` Lucie Manette , only daughter of Doctor Manette , the good physician who sits there . ''
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 10]: This answer had a happy effect upon the audience .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 12]: Cries in exaltation of the well-known good physician rent the hall .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 41]: So capriciously were the people moved , that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before , as if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 23]: On these few steps of his dangerous way , Charles Darnay had set his foot according to Doctor Manette 's reiterated instructions .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 21]: The same cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him , and had prepared every inch of his road .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 18]: The President asked , why had he returned to France when he did , and not sooner ?
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 43]: He had not returned sooner , he replied , simply because he had no means of living in France , save those he had resigned ; whereas , in England , he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 29]: He had returned when he did , on the pressing and written entreaty of a French citizen , who represented that his life was endangered by his absence .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 27]: He had come back , to save a citizen 's life , and to bear his testimony , at whatever personal hazard , to the truth .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 10]: Was that criminal in the eyes of the Republic ?
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 9]: The populace cried enthusiastically , `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 10]: and the President rang his bell to quiet them .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 14]: Which it did not , for they continued to cry `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 10]: until they left off , of their own will .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 9]: The President required the name of that citizen .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 11]: The accused explained that the citizen was his first witness .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 38]: He also referred with confidence to the citizen 's letter , which had been taken from him at the Barrier , but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before the President .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 33]: The Doctor had taken care that it should be there -- had assured him that it would be there -- and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced and read .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 12]: Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it , and did so .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 110]: Citizen Gabelle hinted , with infinite delicacy and politeness , that in the pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of enemies of the Republic with which it had to deal , he had been slightly overlooked in his prison of the Abbaye -- in fact , had rather passed out of the Tribunal 's patriotic remembrance -- until three days ago ; when he had been summoned before it , and had been set at liberty on the Jury 's declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was answered , as to himself , by the surrender of the citizen Evremonde , called Darnay .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 6]: Doctor Manette was next questioned .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 130]: His high personal popularity , and the clearness of his answers , made a great impression ; but , as he proceeded , as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his release from his long imprisonment ; that , the accused had remained in England , always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in their exile ; that , so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat government there , he had actually been tried for his life by it , as the foe of England and friend of the United States -- as he brought these circumstances into view , with the greatest discretion and with the straightforward force of truth and earnestness , the Jury and the populace became one .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 67]: At last , when he appealed by name to Monsieur Lorry , an English gentleman then and there present , who , like himself , had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his account of it , the Jury declared that they had heard enough , and that they were ready with their votes if the President were content to receive them .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 21]: At every vote -LRB- the Jurymen voted aloud and individually -RRB- , the populace set up a shout of applause .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 17]: All the voices were in the prisoner 's favour , and the President declared him free .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 41]: Then , began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace sometimes gratified their fickleness , or their better impulses towards generosity and mercy , or which they regarded as some set-off against their swollen account of cruel rage .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 33]: No man can decide now to which of these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable ; it is probable , to a blending of all the three , with the second predominating .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 99]: No sooner was the acquittal pronounced , than tears were shed as freely as blood at another time , and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him , that after his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from exhaustion ; none the less because he knew very well , that the very same people , carried by another current , would have rushed at him with the very same intensity , to rend him to pieces and strew him over the streets .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 25]: His removal , to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried , rescued him from these caresses for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 27]: Five were to be tried together , next , as enemies of the Republic , forasmuch as they had not assisted it by word or deed .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 36]: So quick was the Tribunal to compensate itself and the nation for a chance lost , that these five came down to him before he left the place , condemned to die within twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 34]: The first of them told him so , with the customary prison sign of Death -- a raised finger -- and they all added in words , `` Long live the Republic ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 59]: The five had had , it is true , no audience to lengthen their proceedings , for when he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate , there was a great crowd about it , in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in Court -- except two , for which he looked in vain .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 56]: On his coming out , the concourse made at him anew , weeping , embracing , and shouting , all by turns and all together , until the very tide of the river on the bank of which the mad scene was acted , seemed to run mad , like the people on the shore .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 32]: They put him into a great chair they had among them , and which they had taken either out of the Court itself , or one of its rooms or passages .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 29]: Over the chair they had thrown a red flag , and to the back of it they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 76]: In this car of triumph , not even the Doctor 's entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home on men 's shoulders , with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him , and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces , that he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion , and that he was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 19]: In wild dreamlike procession , embracing whom they met and pointing him out , they carried him on .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 44]: Reddening the snowy streets with the prevailing Republican colour , in winding and tramping through them , as they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye , they carried him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 27]: Her father had gone on before , to prepare her , and when her husband stood upon his feet , she dropped insensible in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 41]: As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his face and the brawling crowd , so that his tears and her lips might come together unseen , a few of the people fell to dancing .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 17]: Instantly , all the rest fell to dancing , and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 57]: Then , they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty , and then swelling and overflowing out into the adjacent streets , and along the river 's bank , and over the bridge , the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled them away .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 85]: After grasping the Doctor 's hand , as he stood victorious and proud before him ; after grasping the hand of Mr. Lorry , who came panting in breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole ; after kissing little Lucie , who was lifted up to clasp her arms round his neck ; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful Pross who lifted her ; he took his wife in his arms , and carried her up to their rooms .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 3]: `` Lucie !
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 3]: My own !
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 5]: I am safe . ''
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 22]: `` O dearest Charles , let me thank God for this on my knees as I have prayed to Him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 9]: They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 23]: When she was again in his arms , he said to her : `` And now speak to your father , dearest .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 18]: No other man in all this France could have done what he has done for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 27]: She laid her head upon her father 's breast , as she had laid his poor head on her own breast , long , long ago .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 25]: He was happy in the return he had made her , he was recompensed for his suffering , he was proud of his strength .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 20]: `` You must not be weak , my darling , '' he remonstrated ; `` do n't tremble so .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 6]: I have saved him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 13]: VII A Knock at the Door `` I have saved him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 20]: It was not another of the dreams in which he had often come back ; he was really here .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 16]: And yet his wife trembled , and a vague but heavy fear was upon her .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 89]: All the air round was so thick and dark , the people were so passionately revengeful and fitful , the innocent were so constantly put to death on vague suspicion and black malice , it was so impossible to forget that many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to her , every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched , that her heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 23]: The shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall , and even now the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 25]: Her mind pursued them , looking for him among the Condemned ; and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 22]: Her father , cheering her , showed a compassionate superiority to this woman 's weakness , which was wonderful to see .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 17]: No garret , no shoemaking , no One Hundred and Five , North Tower , now !
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 20]: He had accomplished the task he had set himself , his promise was redeemed , he had saved Charles .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 7]: Let them all lean upon him .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 66]: Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind : not only because that was the safest way of life , involving the least offence to the people , but because they were not rich , and Charles , throughout his imprisonment , had had to pay heavily for his bad food , and for his guard , and towards the living of the poorer prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 62]: Partly on this account , and partly to avoid a domestic spy , they kept no servant ; the citizen and citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate , rendered them occasional service ; and Jerry -LRB- almost wholly transferred to them by Mr. Lorry -RRB- had become their daily retainer , and had his bed there every night .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 55]: It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death , that on the door or doorpost of every house , the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters of a certain size , at a certain convenient height from the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 54]: Mr. Jerry Cruncher 's name , therefore , duly embellished the doorpost down below ; and , as the afternoon shadows deepened , the owner of that name himself appeared , from overlooking a painter whom Doctor Manette had employed to add to the list the name of Charles Evremonde , called Darnay .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 21]: In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time , all the usual harmless ways of life were changed .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 35]: In the Doctor 's little household , as in very many others , the articles of daily consumption that were wanted were purchased every evening , in small quantities and at various small shops .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 23]: To avoid attracting notice , and to give as little occasion as possible for talk and envy , was the general desire .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 29]: For some months past , Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged the office of purveyors ; the former carrying the money ; the latter , the basket .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 31]: Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were lighted , they fared forth on this duty , and made and brought home such purchases as were needful .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 65]: Although Miss Pross , through her long association with a French family , might have known as much of their language as of her own , if she had had a mind , she had no mind in that direction ; consequently she knew no more of that `` nonsense '' -LRB- as she was pleased to call it -RRB- than Mr. Cruncher did .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 65]: So her manner of marketing was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any introduction in the nature of an article , and , if it happened not to be the name of the thing she wanted , to look round for that thing , lay hold of it , and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 35]: She always made a bargain for it , by holding up , as a statement of its just price , one finger less than the merchant held up , whatever his number might be .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 28]: `` Now , Mr. Cruncher , '' said Miss Pross , whose eyes were red with felicity ; `` if you are ready , I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 10]: Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross 's service .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 19]: He had worn all his rust off long ago , but nothing would file his spiky head down .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 25]: `` There 's all manner of things wanted , '' said Miss Pross , `` and we shall have a precious time of it .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 8]: We want wine , among the rest .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 14]: Nice toasts these Redheads will be drinking , wherever we buy it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 34]: `` It will be much the same to your knowledge , miss , I should think , '' retorted Jerry , `` whether they drink your health or the Old Un 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 6]: `` Who 's he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 4]: said Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 17]: Mr. Cruncher , with some diffidence , explained himself as meaning `` Old Nick 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 4]: `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 19]: said Miss Pross , `` it does n't need an interpreter to explain the meaning of these creatures .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 15]: They have but one , and it 's Midnight Murder , and Mischief . ''
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 5]: `` Hush , dear !
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 8]: Pray , pray , be cautious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 3]: cried Lucie .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 51]: `` Yes , yes , yes , I 'll be cautious , '' said Miss Pross ; `` but I may say among ourselves , that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey smotherings in the form of embracings all round , going on in the streets .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 15]: Now , Ladybird , never you stir from that fire till I come back !
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 32]: Take care of the dear husband you have recovered , and do n't move your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now , till you see me again !
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 14]: May I ask a question , Doctor Manette , before I go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 16]: `` I think you may take that liberty , '' the Doctor answered , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 23]: `` For gracious sake , do n't talk about Liberty ; we have quite enough of that , '' said Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 5]: `` Hush , dear !
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 3]: Again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 3]: Lucie remonstrated .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 80]: `` Well , my sweet , '' said Miss Pross , nodding her head emphatically , `` the short and the long of it is , that I am a subject of His Most Gracious Majesty King George the Third ; '' Miss Pross curtseyed at the name ; `` and as such , my maxim is , Confound their politics , Frustrate their knavish tricks , On him our hopes we fix , God save the King ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 22]: Mr. Cruncher , in an access of loyalty , growlingly repeated the words after Miss Pross , like somebody at church .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 34]: `` I am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you , though I wish you had never taken that cold in your voice , '' said Miss Pross , approvingly .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 8]: `` But the question , Doctor Manette .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 53]: Is there '' -- it was the good creature 's way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety with them all , and to come at it in this chance manner -- `` is there any prospect yet , of our getting out of this place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 6]: `` I fear not yet .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 9]: It would be dangerous for Charles yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 4]: `` Heigh-ho-hum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 37]: said Miss Pross , cheerfully repressing a sigh as she glanced at her darling 's golden hair in the light of the fire , `` then we must have patience and wait : that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 18]: We must hold up our heads and fight low , as my brother Solomon used to say .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 5]: Now , Mr. Cruncher !
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 9]: -- Do n't you move , Ladybird ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 23]: They went out , leaving Lucie , and her husband , her father , and the child , by a bright fire .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 11]: Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the Banking House .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 24]: Miss Pross had lighted the lamp , but had put it aside in a corner , that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 58]: Little Lucie sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm : and he , in a tone not rising much above a whisper , began to tell her a story of a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out a captive who had once done the Fairy a service .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 17]: All was subdued and quiet , and Lucie was more at ease than she had been .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 6]: `` What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 7]: she cried , all at once .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 5]: `` My dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 20]: said her father , stopping in his story , and laying his hand on hers , `` command yourself .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 8]: What a disordered state you are in !
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 9]: The least thing -- nothing -- startles you !
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 8]: YOU , your father 's daughter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 35]: `` I thought , my father , '' said Lucie , excusing herself , with a pale face and in a faltering voice , `` that I heard strange feet upon the stairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 13]: `` My love , the staircase is as still as Death . ''
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 14]: As he said the word , a blow was struck upon the door .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 6]: `` Oh father , father .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 5]: What can this be !
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 3]: Hide Charles .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 4]: Save him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 25]: `` My child , '' said the Doctor , rising , and laying his hand upon her shoulder , `` I HAVE saved him .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 8]: What weakness is this , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 8]: Let me go to the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 19]: He took the lamp in his hand , crossed the two intervening outer rooms , and opened it .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 27]: A rude clattering of feet over the floor , and four rough men in red caps , armed with sabres and pistols , entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 13]: `` The Citizen Evremonde , called Darnay , '' said the first .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 6]: `` Who seeks him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 3]: answered Darnay .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 5]: `` I seek him .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 4]: We seek him .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 14]: I know you , Evremonde ; I saw you before the Tribunal to-day .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 10]: You are again the prisoner of the Republic . ''
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 17]: The four surrounded him , where he stood with his wife and child clinging to him .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 13]: `` Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 17]: `` It is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie , and will know to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 7]: You are summoned for to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 78]: Doctor Manette , whom this visitation had so turned into stone , that be stood with the lamp in his hand , as if be woe a statue made to hold it , moved after these words were spoken , put the lamp down , and confronting the speaker , and taking him , not ungently , by the loose front of his red woollen shirt , said : `` You know him , you have said .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 6]: Do you know me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 11]: `` Yes , I know you , Citizen Doctor . ''
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 15]: `` We all know you , Citizen Doctor , '' said the other three .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 30]: He looked abstractedly from one to another , and said , in a lower voice , after a pause : `` Will you answer his question to me then ?
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 6]: How does this happen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 23]: `` Citizen Doctor , '' said the first , reluctantly , `` he has been denounced to the Section of Saint Antoine .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 19]: This citizen , '' pointing out the second who had entered , `` is from Saint Antoine . ''
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 20]: The citizen here indicated nodded his head , and added : `` He is accused by Saint Antoine . ''
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 5]: `` Of what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 4]: asked the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 19]: `` Citizen Doctor , '' said the first , with his former reluctance , `` ask no more .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 22]: If the Republic demands sacrifices from you , without doubt you as a good patriot will be happy to make them .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 6]: The Republic goes before all .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 5]: The People is supreme .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 7]: Evremonde , we are pressed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 9]: `` One word , '' the Doctor entreated .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 10]: `` Will you tell me who denounced him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 23]: `` It is against rule , '' answered the first ; `` but you can ask Him of Saint Antoine here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 9]: The Doctor turned his eyes upon that man .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 21]: Who moved uneasily on his feet , rubbed his beard a little , and at length said : `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 6]: Truly it is against rule .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 15]: But he is denounced -- and gravely -- by the Citizen and Citizeness Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 6]: And by one other . ''
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 5]: `` What other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 9]: `` Do YOU ask , Citizen Doctor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 22]: `` Then , '' said he of Saint Antoine , with a strange look , `` you will be answered to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 7]: Now , I am dumb ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 50]: VIII A Hand at Cards Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home , Miss Pross threaded her way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the Pont -- Neuf , reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases she had to make .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 12]: Mr. Cruncher , with the basket , walked at her side .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 44]: They both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they passed , had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people , and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 47]: It was a raw evening , and the misty river , blurred to the eye with blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises , showed where the barges were stationed in which the smiths worked , making guns for the Army of the Republic .
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 18]: Woe to the man who played tricks with THAT Army , or got undeserved promotion in it !
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 18]: Better for him that his beard had never grown , for the National Razor shaved him close .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 28]: Having purchased a few small articles of grocery , and a measure of oil for the lamp , Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 44]: After peeping into several wine-shops , she stopped at the sign of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity , not far from the National Palace , once -LRB- and twice -RRB- the Tuileries , where the aspect of things rather took her fancy .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 33]: It had a quieter look than any other place of the same description they had passed , and , though red with patriotic caps , was not so red as the rest .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 27]: Sounding Mr. Cruncher , and finding him of her opinion , Miss Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity , attended by her cavalier .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 101]: Slightly observant of the smoky lights ; of the people , pipe in mouth , playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes ; of the one bare-breasted , bare-armed , soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud , and of the others listening to him ; of the weapons worn , or laid aside to be resumed ; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep , who in the popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked , in that attitude , like slumbering bears or dogs ; the two outlandish customers approached the counter , and showed what they wanted .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 22]: As their wine was measuring out , a man parted from another man in a corner , and rose to depart .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 10]: In going , he had to face Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 19]: No sooner did he face her , than Miss Pross uttered a scream , and clapped her hands .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 12]: In a moment , the whole company were on their feet .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 16]: That somebody was assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the likeliest occurrence .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 42]: Everybody looked to see somebody fall , but only saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other ; the man with all the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican ; the woman , evidently English .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 52]: What was said in this disappointing anti-climax , by the disciples of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity , except that it was something very voluble and loud , would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss Pross and her protector , though they had been all ears .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 12]: But , they had no ears for anything in their surprise .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 44]: For , it must be recorded , that not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation , but , Mr. Cruncher -- though it seemed on his own separate and individual account -- was in a state of the greatest wonder .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 7]: `` What is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 30]: said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream ; speaking in a vexed , abrupt voice -LRB- though in a low tone -RRB- , and in English .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 9]: `` Oh , Solomon , dear Solomon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 9]: cried Miss Pross , clapping her hands again .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 24]: `` After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time , do I find you here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 7]: `` Do n't call me Solomon .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 11]: Do you want to be the death of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 11]: asked the man , in a furtive , frightened way .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 6]: `` Brother , brother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 8]: cried Miss Pross , bursting into tears .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 19]: `` Have I ever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 24]: `` Then hold your meddlesome tongue , '' said Solomon , `` and come out , if you want to speak to me .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 9]: Pay for your wine , and come out .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 6]: Who 's this man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 27]: Miss Pross , shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means affectionate brother , said through her tears , `` Mr. Cruncher . ''
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 11]: `` Let him come out too , '' said Solomon .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 9]: `` Does he think me a ghost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 12]: Apparently , Mr. Cruncher did , to judge from his looks .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 29]: He said not a word , however , and Miss Pross , exploring the depths of her reticule through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 43]: As she did so , Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity , and offered a few words of explanation in the French language , which caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 21]: `` Now , '' said Solomon , stopping at the dark street corner , `` what do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 17]: `` How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away from ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 19]: cried Miss Pross , `` to give me such a greeting , and show me no affection . ''
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 3]: `` There .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 3]: Confound it !
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 18]: There , '' said Solomon , making a dab at Miss Pross 's lips with his own .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 7]: `` Now are you content ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 11]: Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 36]: `` If you expect me to be surprised , '' said her brother Solomon , `` I am not surprised ; I knew you were here ; I know of most people who are here .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 32]: If you really do n't want to endanger my existence -- which I half believe you do -- go your ways as soon as possible , and let me go mine .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 4]: I am busy .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 6]: I am an official . ''
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 47]: `` My English brother Solomon , '' mourned Miss Pross , casting up her tear-fraught eyes , `` that had the makings in him of one of the best and greatest of men in his native country , an official among foreigners , and such foreigners !
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 20]: I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in his -- '' `` I said so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 6]: cried her brother , interrupting .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 5]: `` I knew it .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 9]: You want to be the death of me .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 11]: I shall be rendered Suspected , by my own sister .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 8]: Just as I am getting on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 9]: `` The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 4]: cried Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 25]: `` Far rather would I never see you again , dear Solomon , though I have ever loved you truly , and ever shall .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 29]: Say but one affectionate word to me , and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us , and I will detain you no longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 4]: Good Miss Pross !
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 14]: As if the estrangement between them had come of any culpability of hers .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 34]: As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact , years ago , in the quiet corner in Soho , that this precious brother had spent her money and left her !
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 68]: He was saying the affectionate word , however , with a far more grudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative merits and positions had been reversed -LRB- which is invariably the case , all the world over -RRB- , when Mr. Cruncher , touching him on the shoulder , hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular question : `` I say !
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 6]: Might I ask the favour ?
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 14]: As to whether your name is John Solomon , or Solomon John ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 9]: The official turned towards him with sudden distrust .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 8]: He had not previously uttered a word .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 4]: `` Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 4]: said Mr. Cruncher .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 8]: `` Speak out , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 16]: -LRB- Which , by the way , was more than he could do himself . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 8]: `` John Solomon , or Solomon John ?
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 14]: She calls you Solomon , and she must know , being your sister .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 10]: And I know you 're John , you know .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 7]: Which of the two goes first ?
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 9]: And regarding that name of Pross , likewise .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 10]: That war n't your name over the water . ''
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 7]: `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 28]: `` Well , I do n't know all I mean , for I ca n't call to mind what your name was , over the water . ''
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 4]: `` No ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 13]: But I 'll swear it was a name of two syllables . ''
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 4]: `` Indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 7]: T'other one 's was one syllable .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 4]: I know you .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 10]: You was a spy -- witness at the Bailey .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 24]: What , in the name of the Father of Lies , own father to yourself , was you called at that time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 11]: `` Barsad , '' said another voice , striking in .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 11]: `` That 's the name for a thousand pound ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 3]: cried Jerry .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 10]: The speaker who struck in , was Sydney Carton .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 34]: He had his hands behind him under the skirts of his riding-coat , and he stood at Mr. Cruncher 's elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 11]: `` Do n't be alarmed , my dear Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 49]: I arrived at Mr. Lorry 's , to his surprise , yesterday evening ; we agreed that I would not present myself elsewhere until all was well , or unless I could be useful ; I present myself here , to beg a little talk with your brother .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 12]: I wish you had a better employed brother than Mr. Barsad .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 16]: I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad was not a Sheep of the Prisons . ''
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 16]: Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy , under the gaolers .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 27]: The spy , who was pale , turned paler , and asked him how he dared -- `` I 'll tell you , '' said Sydney .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 30]: `` I lighted on you , Mr. Barsad , coming out of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls , an hour or more ago .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 14]: You have a face to be remembered , and I remember faces well .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 40]: Made curious by seeing you in that connection , and having a reason , to which you are no stranger , for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate , I walked in your direction .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 16]: I walked into the wine-shop here , close after you , and sat near you .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 27]: I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation , and the rumour openly going about among your admirers , the nature of your calling .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 22]: And gradually , what I had done at random , seemed to shape itself into a purpose , Mr. Barsad . ''
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 5]: `` What purpose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 4]: the spy asked .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 17]: `` It would be troublesome , and might be dangerous , to explain in the street .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 27]: Could you favour me , in confidence , with some minutes of your company -- at the office of Tellson 's Bank , for instance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 6]: `` Under a threat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 6]: Did I say that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 10]: `` Then , why should I go there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 17]: `` Really , Mr. Barsad , I ca n't say , if you ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 13]: `` Do you mean that you wo n't say , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 5]: the spy irresolutely asked .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 10]: `` You apprehend me very clearly , Mr. Barsad .
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 5]: I wo n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 40]: Carton 's negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his quickness and skill , in such a business as he had in his secret mind , and with such a man as he had to do with .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 13]: His practised eye saw it , and made the most of it .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 35]: `` Now , I told you so , '' said the spy , casting a reproachful look at his sister ; `` if any trouble comes of this , it 's your doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 9]: `` Come , come , Mr. Barsad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 3]: exclaimed Sydney .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 6]: `` Do n't be ungrateful .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 31]: But for my great respect for your sister , I might not have led up so pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 10]: Do you go with me to the Bank ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 11]: `` I 'll hear what you have got to say .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 9]: Yes , I 'll go with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 18]: `` I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her own street .
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 9]: Let me take your arm , Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 39]: This is not a good city , at this time , for you to be out in , unprotected ; and as your escort knows Mr. Barsad , I will invite him to Mr. Lorry 's with us .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 4]: Are we ready ?
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 4]: Come then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 73]: Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards , and to the end of her life remembered , that as she pressed her hands on Sydney 's arm and looked up in his face , imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon , there was a braced purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes , which not only contradicted his light manner , but changed and raised the man .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 32]: She was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved her affection , and with Sydney 's friendly reassurances , adequately to heed what she observed .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 29]: They left her at the corner of the street , and Carton led the way to Mr. Lorry 's , which was within a few minutes ' walk .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 12]: John Barsad , or Solomon Pross , walked at his side .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 59]: Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner , and was sitting before a cheery little log or two of fire -- perhaps looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson 's , who had looked into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover , now a good many years ago .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 19]: He turned his head as they entered , and showed the surprise with which he saw a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 12]: `` Miss Pross 's brother , sir , '' said Sydney .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 5]: `` Mr. Barsad . ''
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 4]: `` Barsad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 8]: repeated the old gentleman , `` Barsad ?
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 14]: I have an association with the name -- and with the face . ''
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 19]: `` I told you you had a remarkable face , Mr. Barsad , '' observed Carton , coolly .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 6]: `` Pray sit down . ''
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 31]: As he took a chair himself , he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted , by saying to him with a frown , `` Witness at that trial . ''
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 17]: Mr. Lorry immediately remembered , and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised look of abhorrence .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 29]: `` Mr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate brother you have heard of , '' said Sydney , `` and has acknowledged the relationship .
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 6]: I pass to worse news .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 7]: Darnay has been arrested again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 16]: Struck with consternation , the old gentleman exclaimed , `` What do you tell me !
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 20]: I left him safe and free within these two hours , and am about to return to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 6]: `` Arrested for all that .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 9]: When was it done , Mr. Barsad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 9]: `` Just now , if at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 44]: `` Mr. Barsad is the best authority possible , sir , '' said Sydney , `` and I have it from Mr. Barsad 's communication to a friend and brother Sheep over a bottle of wine , that the arrest has taken place .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 16]: He left the messengers at the gate , and saw them admitted by the porter .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 11]: There is no earthly doubt that he is retaken . ''
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 23]: Mr. Lorry 's business eye read in the speaker 's face that it was loss of time to dwell upon the point .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 23]: Confused , but sensible that something might depend on his presence of mind , he commanded himself , and was silently attentive .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 44]: `` Now , I trust , '' said Sydney to him , `` that the name and influence of Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow -- you said he would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow , Mr. Barsad ?
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 11]: -- '' `` Yes ; I believe so . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 9]: -- In as good stead to-morrow as to-day .
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 7]: But it may not be so .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 27]: I own to you , I am shaken , Mr. Lorry , by Doctor Manette 's not having had the power to prevent this arrest . ''
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 15]: `` He may not have known of it beforehand , '' said Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 21]: `` But that very circumstance would be alarming , when we remember how identified he is with his son-in-law . ''
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 25]: `` That 's true , '' Mr. Lorry acknowledged , with his troubled hand at his chin , and his troubled eyes on Carton .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 24]: `` In short , '' said Sydney , `` this is a desperate time , when desperate games are played for desperate stakes .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 15]: Let the Doctor play the winning game ; I will play the losing one .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 9]: No man 's life here is worth purchase .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 14]: Any one carried home by the people to-day , may be condemned tomorrow .
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 24]: Now , the stake I have resolved to play for , in case of the worst , is a friend in the Conciergerie .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 15]: And the friend I purpose to myself to win , is Mr. Barsad . ''
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 14]: `` You need have good cards , sir , '' said the spy .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 7]: `` I 'll run them over .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 30]: I 'll see what I hold , -- Mr. Lorry , you know what a brute I am ; I wish you 'd give me a little brandy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 24]: It was put before him , and he drank off a glassful -- drank off another glassful -- pushed the bottle thoughtfully away .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 83]: `` Mr. Barsad , '' he went on , in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards : `` Sheep of the prisons , emissary of Republican committees , now turnkey , now prisoner , always spy and secret informer , so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a Frenchman , represents himself to his employers under a false name .
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 7]: That 's a very good card .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 31]: Mr. Barsad , now in the employ of the republican French government , was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic English government , the enemy of France and freedom .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 6]: That 's an excellent card .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 59]: Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion , that Mr. Barsad , still in the pay of the aristocratic English government , is the spy of Pitt , the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom , the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 9]: That 's a card not to be beaten .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 10]: Have you followed my hand , Mr. Barsad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 15]: `` Not to understand your play , '' returned the spy , somewhat uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 16]: `` I play my Ace , Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section Committee .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 14]: Look over your hand , Mr. Barsad , and see what you have .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 5]: Do n't hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 18]: He drew the bottle near , poured out another glassful of brandy , and drank it off .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 22]: He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 11]: Seeing it , he poured out and drank another glassful .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 10]: `` Look over your hand carefully , Mr. Barsad .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 4]: Take time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 9]: It was a poorer hand than he suspected .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 14]: Mr. Barsad saw losing cards in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 83]: Thrown out of his honourable employment in England , through too much unsuccessful hard swearing there -- not because he was not wanted there ; our English reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern date -- he knew that he had crossed the Channel , and accepted service in France : first , as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen there : gradually , as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 70]: He knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint Antoine and Defarge 's wine-shop ; had received from the watchful police such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette 's imprisonment , release , and history , as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with the Defarges ; and tried them on Madame Defarge , and had broken down with them signally .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 31]: He always remembered with fear and trembling , that that terrible woman had knitted when he talked with her , and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 34]: He had since seen her , in the Section of Saint Antoine , over and over again produce her knitted registers , and denounce people whose lives the guillotine then surely swallowed up .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 61]: He knew , as every one employed as he was did , that he was never safe ; that flight was impossible ; that he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe ; and that in spite of his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning terror , a word might bring it down upon him .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 51]: Once denounced , and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind , he foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many proofs , would produce against him that fatal register , and would quash his last chance of life .
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 34]: Besides that all secret men are men soon terrified , here were surely cards enough of one black suit , to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 18]: `` You scarcely seem to like your hand , '' said Sydney , with the greatest composure .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 6]: `` Do you play ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 70]: `` I think , sir , '' said the spy , in the meanest manner , as he turned to Mr. Lorry , `` I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence , to put it to this other gentleman , so much your junior , whether he can under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace of which he has spoken .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 46]: I admit that I am a spy , and that it is considered a discreditable station -- though it must be filled by somebody ; but this gentleman is no spy , and why should he so demean himself as to make himself one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 37]: `` I play my Ace , Mr. Barsad , '' said Carton , taking the answer on himself , and looking at his watch , `` without any scruple , in a very few minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 58]: `` I should have hoped , gentlemen both , '' said the spy , always striving to hook Mr. Lorry into the discussion , `` that your respect for my sister -- '' `` I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally relieving her of her brother , '' said Sydney Carton .
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 8]: `` You think not , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 12]: `` I have thoroughly made up my mind about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 55]: The smooth manner of the spy , curiously in dissonance with his ostentatiously rough dress , and probably with his usual demeanour , received such a check from the inscrutability of Carton , -- who was a mystery to wiser and honester men than he , -- that it faltered here and failed him .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 44]: While he was at a loss , Carton said , resuming his former air of contemplating cards : `` And indeed , now I think again , I have a strong impression that I have another good card here , not yet enumerated .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 23]: That friend and fellow -- Sheep , who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons ; who was he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 3]: `` French .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 13]: You do n't know him , '' said the spy , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 6]: `` French , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 20]: repeated Carton , musing , and not appearing to notice him at all , though he echoed his word .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 8]: `` Well ; he may be . ''
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 20]: `` Is , I assure you , '' said the spy ; `` though it 's not important . ''
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 31]: `` Though it 's not important , '' repeated Carton , in the same mechanical way -- `` though it 's not important -- No , it 's not important .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 7]: Yet I know the face . ''
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 5]: `` I think not .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 5]: I am sure not .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 10]: It ca n't be , '' said the spy .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 26]: `` It-can ` t-be , '' muttered Sydney Carton , retrospectively , and idling his glass -LRB- which fortunately was a small one -RRB- again .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 6]: `` Ca n't - be .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 4]: Spoke good French .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 9]: Yet like a foreigner , I thought ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 8]: `` Provincial , '' said the spy .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 3]: Foreign ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 20]: cried Carton , striking his open hand on the table , as a light broke clearly on his mind .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 3]: `` Cly !
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 7]: Disguised , but the same man .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 12]: We had that man before us at the Old Bailey . ''
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 40]: `` Now , there you are hasty , sir , '' said Barsad , with a smile that gave his aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side ; `` there you really give me an advantage over you .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 26]: Cly -LRB- who I will unreservedly admit , at this distance of time , was a partner of mine -RRB- has been dead several years .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 8]: I attended him in his last illness .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 15]: He was buried in London , at the church of Saint Pancras-in-the -- Fields .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 26]: His unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains , but I helped to lay him in his coffin . ''
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 22]: Here , Mr. Lorry became aware , from where he sat , of a most remarkable goblin shadow on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 32]: Tracing it to its source , he discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff hair on Mr. Cruncher 's head .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 18]: `` Let us be reasonable , '' said the spy , `` and let us be fair .
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 53]: To show you how mistaken you are , and what an unfounded assumption yours is , I will lay before you a certificate of Cly 's burial , which I happened to have carried in my pocket-book , '' with a hurried hand he produced and opened it , `` ever since .
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 4]: There it is .
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 10]: Oh , look at it , look at it !
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 14]: You may take it in your hand ; it 's no forgery . ''
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 21]: Here , Mr. Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate , and Mr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 32]: His hair could not have been more violently on end , if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the crumpled horn in the house that Jack built .
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 23]: Unseen by the spy , Mr. Cruncher stood at his side , and touched him on the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff .
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 20]: `` That there Roger Cly , master , '' said Mr. Cruncher , with a taciturn and iron-bound visage .
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 10]: `` So YOU put him in his coffin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 5]: `` I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 9]: `` Who took him out of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 17]: Barsad leaned back in his chair , and stammered , `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 18]: `` I mean , '' said Mr. Cruncher , `` that he war n't never in it .
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 3]: Not he !
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 16]: I 'll have my head took off , if he was ever in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 18]: The spy looked round at the two gentlemen ; they both looked in unspeakable astonishment at Jerry .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 21]: `` I tell you , '' said Jerry , `` that you buried paving-stones and earth in that there coffin .
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 11]: Do n't go and tell me that you buried Cly .
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 6]: It was a take in .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 8]: Me and two more knows it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 8]: `` How do you know it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 7]: `` What 's that to you ?
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 3]: Ecod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 26]: growled Mr. Cruncher , `` it 's you I have got a old grudge again , is it , with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen !
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 16]: I 'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea . ''
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 31]: Sydney Carton , who , with Mr. Lorry , had been lost in amazement at this turn of the business , here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and explain himself .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 23]: `` At another time , sir , '' he returned , evasively , `` the present time is ill-conwenient for explainin ' .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 22]: What I stand to , is , that he knows well wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 55]: Let him say he was , in so much as a word of one syllable , and I 'll either catch hold of his throat and choke him for half a guinea ; '' Mr. Cruncher dwelt upon this as quite a liberal offer ; `` or I 'll out and announce him . ''
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 3]: `` Humph !
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 9]: I see one thing , '' said Carton .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 9]: `` I hold another card , Mr. Barsad .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 54]: Impossible , here in raging Paris , with Suspicion filling the air , for you to outlive denunciation , when you are in communication with another aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself , who , moreover , has the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again !
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 13]: A plot in the prisons , of the foreigner against the Republic .
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 9]: A strong card -- a certain Guillotine card !
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 5]: Do you play ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 4]: returned the spy .
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 5]: `` I throw up .
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 52]: I confess that we were so unpopular with the outrageous mob , that I only got away from England at the risk of being ducked to death , and that Cly was so ferreted up and down , that he never would have got away at all but for that sham .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 19]: Though how this man knows it was a sham , is a wonder of wonders to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 31]: `` Never you trouble your head about this man , '' retorted the contentious Mr. Cruncher ; `` you 'll have trouble enough with giving your attention to that gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 4]: And look here !
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 4]: Once more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 34]: -- Mr. Cruncher could not be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his liberality -- `` I 'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea . ''
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 27]: The Sheep of the prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton , and said , with more decision , `` It has come to a point .
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 13]: I go on duty soon , and ca n't overstay my time .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 12]: You told me you had a proposal ; what is it ?
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 13]: Now , it is of no use asking too much of me .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 36]: Ask me to do anything in my office , putting my head in great extra danger , and I had better trust my life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent .
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 9]: In short , I should make that choice .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 5]: You talk of desperation .
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 6]: We are all desperate here .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 2]: Remember !
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 24]: I may denounce you if I think proper , and I can swear my way through stone walls , and so can others .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 10]: Now , what do you want with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 5]: `` Not very much .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 9]: You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 25]: `` I tell you once for all , there is no such thing as an escape possible , '' said the spy , firmly .
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 12]: `` Why need you tell me what I have not asked ?
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 9]: You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 6]: `` I am sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 9]: `` You can be when you choose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 12]: `` I can pass in and out when I choose . ''
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 23]: Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy , poured it slowly out upon the hearth , and watched it as it dropped .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 41]: It being all spent , he said , rising : `` So far , we have spoken before these two , because it was as well that the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 17]: Come into the dark room here , and let us have one final word alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 41]: IX The Game Made While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining dark room , speaking so low that not a sound was heard , Mr. Lorry looked at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 100]: That honest tradesman 's manner of receiving the look , did not inspire confidence ; he changed the leg on which he rested , as often as if he had fifty of those limbs , and were trying them all ; he examined his finger-nails with a very questionable closeness of attention ; and whenever Mr. Lorry 's eye caught his , he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it , which is seldom , if ever , known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 8]: `` Jerry , '' said Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 5]: `` Come here . ''
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 16]: Mr. Cruncher came forward sideways , with one of his shoulders in advance of him .
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 11]: `` What have you been , besides a messenger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 27]: After some cogitation , accompanied with an intent look at his patron , Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying , `` Agicultooral character . ''
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 49]: `` My mind misgives me much , '' said Mr. Lorry , angrily shaking a forefinger at him , `` that you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson 's as a blind , and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous description .
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 18]: If you have , do n't expect me to befriend you when you get back to England .
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 13]: If you have , do n't expect me to keep your secret .
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 9]: Tellson 's shall not be imposed upon . ''
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 62]: `` I hope , sir , '' pleaded the abashed Mr. Cruncher , `` that a gentleman like yourself wot I 've had the honour of odd jobbing till I 'm grey at it , would think twice about harming of me , even if it wos so -- I do n't say it is , but even if it wos .
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 28]: And which it is to be took into account that if it wos , it would n't , even then , be all o ' one side .
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 8]: There 'd be two sides to it .
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 28]: There might be medical doctors at the present hour , a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesman do n't pick up his fardens -- fardens !
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 11]: no , nor yet his half fardens -- half fardens !
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 42]: no , nor yet his quarter -- a banking away like smoke at Tellson 's , and a cocking their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly , a going in and going out to their own carriages -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 9]: equally like smoke , if not more so .
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 14]: Well , that ` ud be imposing , too , on Tellson 's .
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 12]: For you can not sarse the goose and not the gander .
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 40]: And here 's Mrs. Cruncher , or leastways wos in the Old England times , and would be to-morrow , if cause given , a floppin ' again the business to that degree as is ruinating -- stark ruinating !
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 15]: Whereas them medical doctors ' wives do n't flop -- catch 'em at it !
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 27]: Or , if they flop , their toppings goes in favour of more patients , and how can you rightly have one without t ` other ?
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 46]: Then , wot with undertakers , and wot with parish clerks , and wot with sextons , and wot with private watchmen -LRB- all awaricious and all in it -RRB- , a man would n't get much by it , even if it wos so .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 17]: And wot little a man did get , would never prosper with him , Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 41]: He 'd never have no good of it ; he 'd want all along to be out of the line , if he , could see his way out , being once in -- even if it wos so . ''
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 4]: `` Ugh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 20]: cried Mr. Lorry , rather relenting , nevertheless , `` I am shocked at the sight of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 44]: `` Now , what I would humbly offer to you , sir , '' pursued Mr. Cruncher , `` even if it wos so , which I do n't say it is -- '' `` Do n't prevaricate , '' said Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 47]: `` No , I will NOT , sir , '' returned Mr. Crunches as if nothing were further from his thoughts or practice -- `` which I do n't say it is -- wot I would humbly offer to you , sir , would be this .
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 54]: Upon that there stool , at that there Bar , sets that there boy of mine , brought up and growed up to be a man , wot will errand you , message you , general-light-job you , till your heels is where your head is , if such should be your wishes .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 111]: If it wos so , which I still do n't say it is -LRB- for I will not prewaricate to you , sir -RRB- , let that there boy keep his father 's place , and take care of his mother ; do n't blow upon that boy 's father -- do not do it , sir -- and let that father go into the line of the reg ` lar diggin ' , and make amends for what he would have undug -- if it wos so-by diggin ' of 'em in with a will , and with conwictions respectin ' the futur ' keepin ' of 'em safe .
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 43]: That , Mr. Lorry , '' said Mr. Cruncher , wiping his forehead with his arm , as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his discourse , `` is wot I would respectfully offer to you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 50]: A man do n't see all this here a goin ' on dreadful round him , in the way of Subjects without heads , dear me , plentiful enough fur to bring the price down to porterage and hardly that , without havin ' his serious thoughts of things .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 46]: And these here would be mine , if it wos so , entreatin ' of you fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now , I up and said in the good cause when I might have kep ' it back . ''
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 12]: `` That at least is true , '' said Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 6]: `` Say no more now .
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 25]: It may be that I shall yet stand your friend , if you deserve it , and repent in action -- not in words .
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 7]: I want no more words . ''
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 18]: Mr. Cruncher knuckled his forehead , as Sydney Carton and the spy returned from the dark room .
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 26]: `` Adieu , Mr. Barsad , '' said the former ; `` our arrangement thus made , you have nothing to fear from me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 15]: He sat down in a chair on the hearth , over against Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 14]: When they were alone , Mr. Lorry asked him what he had done ?
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 4]: `` Not much .
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 19]: If it should go ill with the prisoner , I have ensured access to him , once . ''
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 6]: Mr. Lorry 's countenance fell .
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 12]: `` It is all I could do , '' said Carton .
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 36]: `` To propose too much , would be to put this man 's head under the axe , and , as he himself said , nothing worse could happen to him if he were denounced .
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 9]: It was obviously the weakness of the position .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 8]: There is no help for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 27]: `` But access to him , '' said Mr. Lorry , `` if it should go ill before the Tribunal , will not save him . ''
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 8]: `` I never said it would . ''
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 46]: Mr. Lorry 's eyes gradually sought the fire ; his sympathy with his darling , and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest , gradually weakened them ; he was an old man now , overborne with anxiety of late , and his tears fell .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 20]: `` You are a good man and a true friend , '' said Carton , in an altered voice .
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 11]: `` Forgive me if I notice that you are affected .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 14]: I could not see my father weep , and sit by , careless .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 15]: And I could not respect your sorrow more , if you were my father .
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 10]: You are free from that misfortune , however . ''
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 50]: Though he said the last words , with a slip into his usual manner , there was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch , that Mr. Lorry , who had never seen the better side of him , was wholly unprepared for .
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 12]: He gave him his hand , and Carton gently pressed it .
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 11]: `` To return to poor Darnay , '' said Carton .
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 13]: `` Do n't tell Her of this interview , or this arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 11]: It would not enable Her to go to see him .
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 25]: She might think it was contrived , in case of the worse , to convey to him the means of anticipating the sentence . ''
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 23]: Mr. Lorry had not thought of that , and he looked quickly at Carton to see if it were in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 15]: It seemed to be ; he returned the look , and evidently understood it .
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 24]: `` She might think a thousand things , '' Carton said , `` and any of them would only add to her trouble .
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 8]: Do n't speak of me to her .
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 17]: As I said to you when I first came , I had better not see her .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 26]: I can put my hand out , to do any little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do , without that .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 9]: You are going to her , I hope ?
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 8]: She must be very desolate to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 9]: `` I am going now , directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 7]: `` I am glad of that .
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 13]: She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance on you .
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 6]: How does she look ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 10]: `` Anxious and unhappy , but very beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 17]: It was a long , grieving sound , like a sigh -- almost like a sob .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 18]: It attracted Mr. Lorry 's eyes to Carton 's face , which was turned to the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 56]: A light , or a shade -LRB- the old gentleman could not have said which -RRB- , passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a wild bright day , and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little flaming logs , which was tumbling forward .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 42]: He wore the white riding-coat and top-boots , then in vogue , and the light of the fire touching their light surfaces made him look very pale , with his long brown hair , all untrimmed , hanging loose about him .
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 41]: His indifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr. Lorry ; his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log , when it had broken under the weight of his foot .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 9]: `` I forgot it , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 11]: Mr. Lorry 's eyes were again attracted to his face .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 34]: Taking note of the wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features , and having the expression of prisoners ' faces fresh in his mind , he was strongly reminded of that expression .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 14]: `` And your duties here have drawn to an end , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 7]: said Carton , turning to him .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 26]: As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so unexpectedly , I have at length done all that I can do here .
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 17]: I hoped to have left them in perfect safety , and then to have quitted Paris .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 7]: I have my Leave to Pass .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 7]: I was ready to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 5]: They were both silent .
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 14]: `` Yours is a long life to look back upon , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 5]: said Carton , wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 9]: `` I am in my seventy-eighth year . ''
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 24]: `` You have been useful all your life ; steadily and constantly occupied ; trusted , respected , and looked up to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 17]: `` I have been a man of business , ever since I have been a man .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 17]: indeed , I may say that I was a man of business when a boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 10]: `` See what a place you fill at seventy-eight .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 13]: How many people will miss you when you leave it empty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 15]: `` A solitary old bachelor , '' answered Mr. Lorry , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 10]: `` There is nobody to weep for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 7]: `` How can you say that ?
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 7]: Would n't She weep for you ?
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 6]: Would n't her child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 8]: `` Yes , yes , thank God .
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 10]: I did n't quite mean what I said . ''
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 15]: `` It IS a thing to thank God for ; is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 6]: `` Surely , surely . ''
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 62]: `` If you could say , with truth , to your own solitary heart , to-night , ` I have secured to myself the love and attachment , the gratitude or respect , of no human creature ; I have won myself a tender place in no regard ; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by ! '
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 14]: your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses ; would they not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 15]: `` You say truly , Mr. Carton ; I think they would be . ''
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 37]: Sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire , and , after a silence of a few moments , said : `` I should like to ask you : -- Does your childhood seem far off ?
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 20]: Do the days when you sat at your mother 's knee , seem days of very long ago ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 26]: Responding to his softened manner , Mr. Lorry answered : `` Twenty years back , yes ; at this time of my life , no .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 25]: For , as I draw closer and closer to the end , I travel in the circle , nearer and nearer to the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 15]: It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and preparings of the way .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 27]: My heart is touched now , by many remembrances that had long fallen asleep , of my pretty young mother -LRB- and I so old ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 31]: , and by many associations of the days when what we call the World was not so real with me , and my faults were not confirmed in me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 7]: `` I understand the feeling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 8]: exclaimed Carton , with a bright flush .
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 10]: `` And you are the better for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 6]: `` I hope so . ''
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 37]: Carton terminated the conversation here , by rising to help him on with his outer coat ; `` But you , '' said Mr. Lorry , reverting to the theme , `` you are young . ''
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Carton .
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 17]: `` I am not old , but my young way was never the way to age .
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 5]: Enough of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 14]: `` And of me , I am sure , '' said Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 7]: `` Are you going out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 10]: `` I 'll walk with you to her gate .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 8]: You know my vagabond and restless habits .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 23]: If I should prowl about the streets a long time , do n't be uneasy ; I shall reappear in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 8]: You go to the Court to-morrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 6]: `` Yes , unhappily . ''
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 14]: `` I shall be there , but only as one of the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 9]: My Spy will find a place for me .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 7]: Take my arm , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 15]: Mr. Lorry did so , and they went down-stairs and out in the streets .
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 11]: A few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry 's destination .
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 28]: Carton left him there ; but lingered at a little distance , and turned back to the gate again when it was shut , and touched it .
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 12]: He had heard of her going to the prison every day .
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 27]: `` She came out here , '' he said , looking about him , `` turned this way , must have trod on these stones often .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 8]: Let me follow in her steps . ''
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 24]: It was ten o'clock at night when he stood before the prison of La Force , where she had stood hundreds of times .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 17]: A little wood-sawyer , having closed his shop , was smoking his pipe at his shop-door .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 24]: `` Good night , citizen , '' said Sydney Carton , pausing in going by ; for , the man eyed him inquisitively .
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 7]: `` Good night , citizen . ''
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 7]: `` How goes the Republic ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 6]: `` You mean the Guillotine .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 3]: Not ill .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 3]: Sixty-three to-day .
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 8]: We shall mount to a hundred soon .
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 11]: Samson and his men complain sometimes , of being exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 8]: He is so droll , that Samson .
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 5]: Such a Barber ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 13]: `` Do you often go to see him -- '' `` Shave ?
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 2]: Always .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 3]: Every day .
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 4]: What a barber !
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 8]: You have seen him at work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 4]: `` Never . ''
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 12]: `` Go and see him when he has a good batch .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 19]: Figure this to yourself , citizen ; he shaved the sixty-three to-day , in less than two pipes !
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 5]: Less than two pipes .
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 5]: Word of honour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 42]: As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking , to explain how he timed the executioner , Carton was so sensible of a rising desire to strike the life out of him , that he turned away .
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 20]: `` But you are not English , '' said the wood-sawyer , `` though you wear English dress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 16]: `` Yes , '' said Carton , pausing again , and answering over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 8]: `` You speak like a Frenchman . ''
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 9]: `` I am an old student here . ''
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 7]: `` Aha , a perfect Frenchman !
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 6]: Good night , Englishman . ''
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 7]: `` Good night , citizen . ''
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 19]: `` But go and see that droll dog , '' the little man persisted , calling after him .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 9]: `` And take a pipe with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 34]: Sydney had not gone far out of sight , when he stopped in the middle of the street under a glimmering lamp , and wrote with his pencil on a scrap of paper .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 57]: Then , traversing with the decided step of one who remembered the way well , several dark and dirty streets -- much dirtier than usual , for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of terror -- he stopped at a chemist 's shop , which the owner was closing with his own hands .
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 25]: A small , dim , crooked shop , kept in a tortuous , up-hill thoroughfare , by a small , dim , crooked man .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 26]: Giving this citizen , too , good night , as he confronted him at his counter , he laid the scrap of paper before him .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 4]: `` Whew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 10]: the chemist whistled softly , as he read it .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 3]: `` Hi !
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 2]: hi !
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 3]: hi ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 18]: Sydney Carton took no heed , and the chemist said : `` For you , citizen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 5]: `` For me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 12]: `` You will be careful to keep them separate , citizen ?
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 9]: You know the consequences of mixing them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 4]: `` Perfectly . ''
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 10]: Certain small packets were made and given to him .
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 29]: He put them , one by one , in the breast of his inner coat , counted out the money for them , and deliberately left the shop .
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 22]: `` There is nothing more to do , '' said he , glancing upward at the moon , `` until to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 6]: I ca n't sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 31]: It was not a reckless manner , the manner in which he said these words aloud under the fast-sailing clouds , nor was it more expressive of negligence than defiance .
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 32]: It was the settled manner of a tired man , who had wandered and struggled and got lost , but who at length struck into his road and saw its end .
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 28]: Long ago , when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a youth of great promise , he had followed his father to the grave .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 8]: His mother had died , years before .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 43]: These solemn words , which had been read at his father 's grave , arose in his mind as he went down the dark streets , among the heavy shadows , with the moon and the clouds sailing on high above him .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 42]: `` I am the resurrection and the life , saith the Lord : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live : and whosoever liveth and believeth in me , shall never die . ''
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 79]: In a city dominated by the axe , alone at night , with natural sorrow rising in him for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death , and for to-morrow 's victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons , and still of to-morrow 's and to-morrow 's , the chain of association that brought the words home , like a rusty old ship 's anchor from the deep , might have been easily found .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 13]: He did not seek it , but repeated them and went on .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 162]: With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were going to rest , forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors surrounding them ; in the towers of the churches , where no prayers were said , for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length of self-destruction from years of priestly impostors , plunderers , and profligates ; in the distant burial-places , reserved , as they wrote upon the gates , for Eternal Sleep ; in the abounding gaols ; and in the streets along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and material , that no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among the people out of all the working of the Guillotine ; with a solemn interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its short nightly pause in fury ; Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for the lighter streets .
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 33]: Few coaches were abroad , for riders in coaches were liable to be suspected , and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps , and put on heavy shoes , and trudged .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 24]: But , the theatres were all well filled , and the people poured cheerfully out as he passed , and went chatting home .
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 27]: At one of the theatre doors , there was a little girl with a mother , looking for a way across the street through the mud .
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 23]: He carried the child over , and before , the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss .
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 42]: `` I am the resurrection and the life , saith the Lord : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live : and whosoever liveth and believeth in me , shall never die . ''
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 30]: Now , that the streets were quiet , and the night wore on , the words were in the echoes of his feet , and were in the air .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 22]: Perfectly calm and steady , he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked ; but , he heard them always .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 60]: The night wore out , and , as he stood upon the bridge listening to the water as it splashed the river-walls of the Island of Paris , where the picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light of the moon , the day came coldly , looking like a dead face out of the sky .
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 35]: Then , the night , with the moon and the stars , turned pale and died , and for a little while it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to Death 's dominion .
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 32]: But , the glorious sun , rising , seemed to strike those words , that burden of the night , straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 32]: And looking along them , with reverently shaded eyes , a bridge of light appeared to span the air between him and the sun , while the river sparkled under it .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 24]: The strong tide , so swift , so deep , and certain , was like a congenial friend , in the morning stillness .
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 26]: He walked by the stream , far from the houses , and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the bank .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 39]: When he awoke and was afoot again , he lingered there yet a little longer , watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless , until the stream absorbed it , and carried it on to the sea .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 6]: -- `` Like me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 29]: A trading-boat , with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf , then glided into his view , floated by him , and died away .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 46]: As its silent track in the water disappeared , the prayer that had broken up out of his heart for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors , ended in the words , `` I am the resurrection and the life . ''
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 24]: Mr. Lorry was already out when he got back , and it was easy to surmise where the good old man was gone .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 31]: Sydney Carton drank nothing but a little coffee , ate some bread , and , having washed and changed to refresh himself , went out to the place of trial .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 31]: The court was all astir and a-buzz , when the black sheep -- whom many fell away from in dread -- pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 11]: Mr. Lorry was there , and Doctor Manette was there .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 9]: She was there , sitting beside her father .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 55]: When her husband was brought in , she turned a look upon him , so sustaining , so encouraging , so full of admiring love and pitying tenderness , yet so courageous for his sake , that it called the healthy blood into his face , brightened his glance , and animated his heart .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 30]: If there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look , on Sydney Carton , it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 23]: Before that unjust Tribunal , there was little or no order of procedure , ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 41]: There could have been no such Revolution , if all laws , forms , and ceremonies , had not first been so monstrously abused , that the suicidal vengeance of the Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds .
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 8]: Every eye was turned to the jury .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 21]: The same determined patriots and good republicans as yesterday and the day before , and to-morrow and the day after .
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 31]: Eager and prominent among them , one man with a craving face , and his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips , whose appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators .
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 15]: A life-thirsting , cannibal-looking , bloody-minded juryman , the Jacques Three of St. Antoine .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 15]: The whole jury , as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer .
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 13]: Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 8]: No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 9]: A fell , uncompromising , murderous business-meaning there .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 32]: Every eye then sought some other eye in the crowd , and gleamed at it approvingly ; and heads nodded at one another , before bending forward with a strained attention .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 6]: Charles Evremonde , called Darnay .
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 3]: Released yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 5]: Reaccused and retaken yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 7]: Indictment delivered to him last night .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 39]: Suspected and Denounced enemy of the Republic , Aristocrat , one of a family of tyrants , one of a race proscribed , for that they had used their abolished privileges to the infamous oppression of the people .
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 17]: Charles Evremonde , called Darnay , in right of such proscription , absolutely Dead in Law .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 15]: To this effect , in as few or fewer words , the Public Prosecutor .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 12]: The President asked , was the Accused openly denounced or secretly ?
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 6]: `` Openly , President . ''
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 5]: `` By whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 4]: `` Three voices .
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 9]: Ernest Defarge , wine-vendor of St. Antoine . ''
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 4]: `` Good . ''
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 8]: `` Therese Defarge , his wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 4]: `` Good . ''
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 7]: `` Alexandre Manette , physician . ''
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 32]: A great uproar took place in the court , and in the midst of it , Doctor Manette was seen , pale and trembling , standing where he had been seated .
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 17]: `` President , I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and a fraud .
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 12]: You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter .
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 18]: My daughter , and those dear to her , are far dearer to me than my life .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 19]: Who and where is the false conspirator who says that I denounce the husband of my child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 7]: `` Citizen Manette , be tranquil .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 19]: To fail in submission to the authority of the Tribunal would be to put yourself out of Law .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 24]: As to what is dearer to you than life , nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the Republic . ''
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 6]: Loud acclamations hailed this rebuke .
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 11]: The President rang his bell , and with warmth resumed .
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 25]: `` If the Republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child herself , you would have no duty but to sacrifice her .
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 7]: Listen to what is to follow .
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 8]: In the meanwhile , be silent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 6]: Frantic acclamations were again raised .
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 23]: Doctor Manette sat down , with his eyes looking around , and his lips trembling ; his daughter drew closer to him .
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 20]: The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together , and restored the usual hand to his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 59]: Defarge was produced , when the court was quiet enough to admit of his being heard , and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment , and of his having been a mere boy in the Doctor 's service , and of the release , and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 14]: This short examination followed , for the court was quick with its work .
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 15]: `` You did good service at the taking of the Bastille , citizen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 6]: `` I believe so . ''
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 20]: Here , an excited woman screeched from the crowd : `` You were one of the best patriots there .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 5]: Why not say so ?
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 23]: You were a cannoneer that day there , and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when it fell .
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 8]: Patriots , I speak the truth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 19]: It was The Vengeance who , amidst the warm commendations of the audience , thus assisted the proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 24]: The President rang his bell ; but , The Vengeance , warming with encouragement , shrieked , `` I defy that bell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 7]: wherein she was likewise much commended .
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 17]: `` Inform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille , citizen . ''
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 62]: `` I knew , '' said Defarge , looking down at his wife , who stood at the bottom of the steps on which he was raised , looking steadily up at him ; `` I knew that this prisoner , of whom I speak , had been confined in a cell known as One Hundred and Five , North Tower .
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 6]: I knew it from himself .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 24]: He knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and Five , North Tower , when he made shoes under my care .
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 22]: As I serve my gun that day , I resolve , when the place shall fall , to examine that cell .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 3]: It falls .
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 21]: I mount to the cell , with a fellow-citizen who is one of the Jury , directed by a gaoler .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 7]: I examine it , very closely .
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 23]: In a hole in the chimney , where a stone has been worked out and replaced , I find a written paper .
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 6]: This is that written paper .
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 17]: I have made it my business to examine some specimens of the writing of Doctor Manette .
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 8]: This is the writing of Doctor Manette .
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 20]: I confide this paper , in the writing of Doctor Manette , to the hands of the President . ''
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 7]: `` Let it be read . ''
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 84]: In a dead silence and stillness -- the prisoner under trial looking lovingly at his wife , his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father , Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the reader , Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner , Defarge never taking his from his feasting wife , and all the other eyes there intent upon the Doctor , who saw none of them -- the paper was read , as follows .
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 47]: X The Substance of the Shadow `` I , Alexandre Manette , unfortunate physician , native of Beauvais , and afterwards resident in Paris , write this melancholy paper in my doleful cell in the Bastille , during the last month of the year , 1767 .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 11]: I write it at stolen intervals , under every difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 26]: I design to secrete it in the wall of the chimney , where I have slowly and laboriously made a place of concealment for it .
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 16]: Some pitying hand may find it there , when I and my sorrows are dust .
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 42]: `` These words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I write with difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney , mixed with blood , in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity .
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 8]: Hope has quite departed from my breast .
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 77]: I know from terrible warnings I have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired , but I solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right mind -- that my memory is exact and circumstantial -- and that I write the truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words , whether they be ever read by men or not , at the Eternal Judgment-seat .
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 78]: `` One cloudy moonlight night , in the third week of December -LRB- I think the twenty-second of the month -RRB- in the year 1757 , I was walking on a retired part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of the frosty air , at an hour 's distance from my place of residence in the Street of the School of Medicine , when a carriage came along behind me , driven very fast .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 38]: As I stood aside to let that carriage pass , apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down , a head was put out at the window , and a voice called to the driver to stop .
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 26]: `` The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses , and the same voice called to me by my name .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 3]: I answered .
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 28]: The carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the door and alight before I came up with it .
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 16]: I observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks , and appeared to conceal themselves .
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 55]: As they stood side by side near the carriage door , I also observed that they both looked of about my own age , or rather younger , and that they were greatly alike , in stature , manner , voice , and -LRB- as far as I could see -RRB- face too . ''
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 7]: ` You are Doctor Manette ? '
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 3]: said one .
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 6]: `` I am . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 40]: ` Doctor Manette , formerly of Beauvais , ' said the other ; ` the young physician , originally an expert surgeon , who within the last year or two has made a rising reputation in Paris ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 22]: ` Gentlemen , ' I returned , ` I am that Doctor Manette of whom you speak so graciously . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 47]: ` We have been to your residence , ' said the first , ` and not being so fortunate as to find you there , and being informed that you were probably walking in this direction , we followed , in the hope of overtaking you .
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 9]: Will you please to enter the carriage ? '
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 31]: `` The manner of both was imperious , and they both moved , as these words were spoken , so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door .
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 4]: They were armed .
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 5]: I was not . ''
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 40]: ` Gentlemen , ' said I , ` pardon me ; but I usually inquire who does me the honour to seek my assistance , and what is the nature of the case to which I am summoned . '
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 14]: `` The reply to this was made by him who had spoken second .
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 10]: ` Doctor , your clients are people of condition .
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 29]: As to the nature of the case , our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for yourself better than we can describe it .
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 2]: Enough .
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 9]: Will you please to enter the carriage ? '
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 15]: `` I could do nothing but comply , and I entered it in silence .
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 17]: They both entered after me -- the last springing in , after putting up the steps .
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 13]: The carriage turned about , and drove on at its former speed .
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 10]: `` I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred .
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 15]: I have no doubt that it is , word for word , the same .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 19]: I describe everything exactly as it took place , constraining my mind not to wander from the task .
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 25]: Where I make the broken marks that follow here , I leave off for the time , and put my paper in its hiding-place .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 21]: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- `` The carriage left the streets behind , passed the North Barrier , and emerged upon the country road .
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 72]: At two-thirds of a league from the Barrier -- I did not estimate the distance at that time , but afterwards when I traversed it -- it struck out of the main avenue , and presently stopped at a solitary house , We all three alighted , and walked , by a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had overflowed , to the door of the house .
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 38]: It was not opened immediately , in answer to the ringing of the bell , and one of my two conductors struck the man who opened it , with his heavy riding glove , across the face .
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 25]: `` There was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention , for I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs .
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 46]: But , the other of the two , being angry likewise , struck the man in like manner with his arm ; the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly alike , that I then first perceived them to be twin brothers .
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 44]: `` From the time of our alighting at the outer gate -LRB- which we found locked , and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us , and had relocked -RRB- , I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber .
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 36]: I was conducted to this chamber straight , the cries growing louder as we ascended the stairs , and I found a patient in a high fever of the brain , lying on a bed .
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 19]: `` The patient was a woman of great beauty , and young ; assuredly not much past twenty .
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 20]: Her hair was torn and ragged , and her arms were bound to her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs .
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 14]: I noticed that these bonds were all portions of a gentleman 's dress .
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 83]: On one of them , which was a fringed scarf for a dress of ceremony , I saw the armorial bearings of a Noble , and the letter E. `` I saw this , within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient ; for , in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the edge of the bed , had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth , and was in danger of suffocation .
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 30]: My first act was to put out my hand to relieve her breathing ; and in moving the scarf aside , the embroidery in the corner caught my sight .
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 27]: `` I turned her gently over , placed my hands upon her breast to calm her and keep her down , and looked into her face .
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 31]: Her eyes were dilated and wild , and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks , and repeated the words , ` My husband , my father , and my brother ! '
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 14]: and then counted up to twelve , and said , ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 42]: For an instant , and no more , she would pause to listen , and then the piercing shrieks would begin again , and she would repeat the cry , ` My husband , my father , and my brother ! '
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 14]: and would count up to twelve , and say , ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 12]: There was no variation in the order , or the manner .
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 20]: There was no cessation , but the regular moment 's pause , in the utterance of these sounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 14]: ` How long , ' I asked , ` has this lasted ? '
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 29]: `` To distinguish the brothers , I will call them the elder and the younger ; by the elder , I mean him who exercised the most authority .
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 17]: It was the elder who replied , ` Since about this hour last night . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 15]: ` She has a husband , a father , and a brother ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 6]: ` A brother . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 9]: ` I do not address her brother ? '
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 12]: `` He answered with great contempt , ` No . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 12]: ` She has some recent association with the number twelve ? '
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 14]: `` The younger brother impatiently rejoined , ` With twelve o'clock ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 29]: ` See , gentlemen , ' said I , still keeping my hands upon her breast , ` how useless I am , as you have brought me !
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 17]: If I had known what I was coming to see , I could have come provided .
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 9]: As it is , time must be lost .
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 13]: There are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place . '
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 37]: `` The elder brother looked to the younger , who said haughtily , ` There is a case of medicines here ; ' and brought it from a closet , and put it on the table .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 20]: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- `` I opened some of the bottles , smelt them , and put the stoppers to my lips .
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 26]: If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were poisons in themselves , I would not have administered any of those . ''
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 7]: ` Do you doubt them ? '
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 6]: asked the younger brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 22]: ` You see , monsieur , I am going to use them , ' I replied , and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 24]: `` I made the patient swallow , with great difficulty , and after many efforts , the dose that I desired to give .
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 31]: As I intended to repeat it after a while , and as it was necessary to watch its influence , I then sat down by the side of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 24]: There was a timid and suppressed woman in attendance -LRB- wife of the man down-stairs -RRB- , who had retreated into a corner .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 18]: The house was damp and decayed , indifferently furnished -- evidently , recently occupied and temporarily used .
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 20]: Some thick old hangings had been nailed up before the windows , to deaden the sound of the shrieks .
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 26]: They continued to be uttered in their regular succession , with the cry , ` My husband , my father , and my brother ! '
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 11]: the counting up to twelve , and ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 33]: The frenzy was so violent , that I had not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms ; but , I had looked to them , to see that they were not painful .
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 36]: The only spark of encouragement in the case , was , that my hand upon the sufferer 's breast had this much soothing influence , that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the figure .
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 15]: It had no effect upon the cries ; no pendulum could be more regular .
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 49]: `` For the reason that my hand had this effect -LRB- I assume -RRB- , I had sat by the side of the bed for half an hour , with the two brothers looking on , before the elder said : '' ` There is another patient . '
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 17]: `` I was startled , and asked , ` Is it a pressing case ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 17]: ` You had better see , ' he carelessly answered ; and took up a light .
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 25]: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- `` The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase , which was a species of loft over a stable .
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 31]: There was a low plastered ceiling to a part of it ; the rest was open , to the ridge of the tiled roof , and there were beams across .
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 24]: Hay and straw were stored in that portion of the place , fagots for firing , and a heap of apples in sand .
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 14]: I had to pass through that part , to get at the other .
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 7]: My memory is circumstantial and unshaken .
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 40]: I try it with these details , and I see them all , in this my cell in the Bastille , near the close of the tenth year of my captivity , as I saw them all that night .
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 33]: `` On some hay on the ground , with a cushion thrown under his head , lay a handsome peasant boy -- a boy of not more than seventeen at the most .
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 27]: He lay on his back , with his teeth set , his right hand clenched on his breast , and his glaring eyes looking straight upward .
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 36]: I could not see where his wound was , as I kneeled on one knee over him ; but , I could see that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point . ''
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 21]: ` I am a doctor , my poor fellow , ' said I. ` Let me examine it . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 18]: ` I do not want it examined , ' he answered ; ` let it be . '
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 19]: `` It was under his hand , and I soothed him to let me move his hand away .
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 30]: The wound was a sword-thrust , received from twenty to twenty-four hours before , but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to without delay .
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 6]: He was then dying fast .
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 50]: As I turned my eyes to the elder brother , I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was ebbing out , as if he were a wounded bird , or hare , or rabbit ; not at all as if he were a fellow-creature . ''
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 10]: ` How has this been done , monsieur ? '
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 10]: said I. '' ` A crazed young common dog !
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 3]: A serf !
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 22]: Forced my brother to draw upon him , and has fallen by my brother 's sword -- like a gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 18]: `` There was no touch of pity , sorrow , or kindred humanity , in this answer .
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 40]: The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to have that different order of creature dying there , and that it would have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his vermin kind .
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 17]: He was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about the boy , or about his fate .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 24]: `` The boy 's eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken , and they now slowly moved to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 21]: ` Doctor , they are very proud , these Nobles ; but we common dogs are proud too , sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 23]: They plunder us , outrage us , beat us , kill us ; but we have a little pride left , sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 10]: She -- have you seen her , Doctor ? '
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 16]: `` The shrieks and the cries were audible there , though subdued by the distance .
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 14]: He referred to them , as if she were lying in our presence .
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 12]: `` I said , ` I have seen her . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 8]: ` She is my sister , Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 31]: They have had their shameful rights , these Nobles , in the modesty and virtue of our sisters , many years , but we have had good girls among us .
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 12]: I know it , and have heard my father say so .
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 6]: She was a good girl .
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 16]: She was betrothed to a good young man , too : a tenant of his .
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 14]: We were all tenants of his -- that man 's who stands there .
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 14]: The other is his brother , the worst of a bad race . '
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 27]: `` It was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force to speak ; but , his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis . ''
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 179]: ` We were so robbed by that man who stands there , as all we common dogs are by those superior Beings -- taxed by him without mercy , obliged to work for him without pay , obliged to grind our corn at his mill , obliged to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops , and forbidden for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own , pillaged and plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat , we ate it in fear , with the door barred and the shutters closed , that his people should not see it and take it from us -- I say , we were so robbed , and hunted , and were made so poor , that our father told us it was a dreadful thing to bring a child into the world , and that what we should most pray for , was , that our women might be barren and our miserable race die out ! '
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 18]: `` I had never before seen the sense of being oppressed , bursting forth like a fire .
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 33]: I had supposed that it must be latent in the people somewhere ; but , I had never seen it break out , until I saw it in the dying boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 9]: ` Nevertheless , Doctor , my sister married .
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 37]: He was ailing at that time , poor fellow , and she married her lover , that she might tend and comfort him in our cottage -- our dog-hut , as that man would call it .
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 36]: She had not been married many weeks , when that man 's brother saw her and admired her , and asked that man to lend her to him -- for what are husbands among us !
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 25]: He was willing enough , but my sister was good and virtuous , and hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine .
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 23]: What did the two then , to persuade her husband to use his influence with her , to make her willing ? '
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 33]: `` The boy 's eyes , which had been fixed on mine , slowly turned to the looker-on , and I saw in the two faces that all he said was true .
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 39]: The two opposing kinds of pride confronting one another , I can see , even in this Bastille ; the gentleman 's , all negligent indifference ; the peasants , all trodden-down sentiment , and passionate revenge . ''
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 27]: ` You know , Doctor , that it is among the Rights of these Nobles to harness us common dogs to carts , and drive us .
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 8]: They so harnessed him and drove him .
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 32]: You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in their grounds all night , quieting the frogs , in order that their noble sleep may not be disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 22]: They kept him out in the unwholesome mists at night , and ordered him back into his harness in the day .
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 6]: But he was not persuaded .
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 38]: Taken out of harness one day at noon , to feed -- if he could find food -- he sobbed twelve times , once for every stroke of the bell , and died on her bosom . '
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 19]: `` Nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to tell all his wrong .
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 27]: He forced back the gathering shadows of death , as he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched , and to cover his wound . ''
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 70]: ` Then , with that man 's permission and even with his aid , his brother took her away ; in spite of what I know she must have told his brother -- and what that is , will not be long unknown to you , Doctor , if it is now -- his brother took her away -- for his pleasure and diversion , for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 9]: I saw her pass me on the road .
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 24]: When I took the tidings home , our father 's heart burst ; he never spoke one of the words that filled it .
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 34]: I took my young sister -LRB- for I have another -RRB- to a place beyond the reach of this man , and where , at least , she will never be HIS vassal .
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 23]: Then , I tracked the brother here , and last night climbed in -- a common dog , but sword in hand .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 7]: -- Where is the loft window ?
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 6]: It was somewhere here ? '
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 16]: `` The room was darkening to his sight ; the world was narrowing around him .
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 27]: I glanced about me , and saw that the hay and straw were trampled over the floor , as if there had been a struggle . ''
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 9]: ` She heard me , and ran in .
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 13]: I told her not to come near us till he was dead .
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 20]: He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money ; then struck at me with a whip .
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 18]: But I , though a common dog , so struck at him as to make him draw .
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 39]: Let him break into as many pieces as he will , the sword that he stained with my common blood ; he drew to defend himself -- thrust at me with all his skill for his life . '
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 25]: `` My glance had fallen , but a few moments before , on the fragments of a broken sword , lying among the hay .
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 7]: That weapon was a gentleman 's .
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 18]: In another place , lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 13]: ` Now , lift me up , Doctor ; lift me up .
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 6]: Where is he ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 24]: ` He is not here , ' I said , supporting the boy , and thinking that he referred to the brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 3]: ` He !
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 13]: Proud as these nobles are , he is afraid to see me .
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 8]: Where is the man who was here ?
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 7]: turn my face to him . '
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 14]: `` I did so , raising the boy 's head against my knee .
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 31]: But , invested for the moment with extraordinary power , he raised himself completely : obliging me to rise too , or I could not have still supported him . ''
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 56]: ` Marquis , ' said the boy , turned to him with his eyes opened wide , and his right hand raised , ` in the days when all these things are to be answered for , I summon you and yours , to the last of your bad race , to answer for them .
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 17]: I mark this cross of blood upon you , as a sign that I do it .
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 31]: In the days when all these things are to be answered for , I summon your brother , the worst of the bad race , to answer for them separately .
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 18]: I mark this cross of blood upon him , as a sign that I do it . '
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 25]: `` Twice , he put his hand to the wound in his breast , and with his forefinger drew a cross in the air .
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 28]: He stood for an instant with the finger yet raised , and as it dropped , he dropped with it , and I laid him down dead .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 25]: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- `` When I returned to the bedside of the young woman , I found her raving in precisely the same order of continuity .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 23]: I knew that this might last for many hours , and that it would probably end in the silence of the grave .
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 26]: `` I repeated the medicines I had given her , and I sat at the side of the bed until the night was far advanced .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 22]: She never abated the piercing quality of her shrieks , never stumbled in the distinctness or the order of her words .
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 14]: They were always ` My husband , my father , and my brother !
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 24]: One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten , eleven , twelve .
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 3]: Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 14]: `` This lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her .
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 20]: I had come and gone twice , and was again sitting by her , when she began to falter .
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 26]: I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity , and by-and-bye she sank into a lethargy , and lay like the dead .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 21]: `` It was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last , after a long and fearful storm .
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 23]: I released her arms , and called the woman to assist me to compose her figure and the dress she had to .
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 42]: It was then that I knew her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being a mother have arisen ; and it was then that I lost the little hope I had had of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 6]: ` Is she dead ? '
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 24]: asked the Marquis , whom I will still describe as the elder brother , coming booted into the room from his horse . ''
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 16]: ` Not dead , ' said I ; ` but like to die . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 11]: ` What strength there is in these common bodies ! '
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 12]: he said , looking down at her with some curiosity . ''
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 18]: ` There is prodigious strength , ' I answered him , ` in sorrow and despair . '
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 14]: `` He first laughed at my words , and then frowned at them .
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 46]: He moved a chair with his foot near to mine , ordered the woman away , and said in a subdued voice , '' ` Doctor , finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds , I recommended that your aid should be invited .
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 25]: Your reputation is high , and , as a young man with your fortune to make , you are probably mindful of your interest .
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 19]: The things that you see here , are things to be seen , and not spoken of . '
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 14]: `` I listened to the patient 's breathing , and avoided answering . ''
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 13]: ` Do you honour me with your attention , Doctor ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 23]: ` Monsieur , ' said I , ` in my profession , the communications of patients are always received in confidence . '
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 22]: I was guarded in my answer , for I was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 19]: `` Her breathing was so difficult to trace , that I carefully tried the pulse and the heart .
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 8]: There was life , and no more .
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 17]: Looking round as I resumed my seat , I found both the brothers intent upon me .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 39]: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- `` I write with so much difficulty , the cold is so severe , I am so fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness , that I must abridge this narrative .
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 30]: There is no confusion or failure in my memory ; it can recall , and could detail , every word that was ever spoken between me and those brothers .
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 7]: `` She lingered for a week .
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 25]: Towards the last , I could understand some few syllables that she said to me , by placing my ear close to her lips .
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 21]: She asked me where she was , and I told her ; who I was , and I told her .
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 13]: It was in vain that I asked her for her family name .
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 20]: She faintly shook her head upon the pillow , and kept her secret , as the boy had done .
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 29]: `` I had no opportunity of asking her any question , until I had told the brothers she was sinking fast , and could not live another day .
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 41]: Until then , though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the woman and myself , one or other of them had always jealously sat behind the curtain at the head of the bed when I was there .
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 33]: But when it came to that , they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her ; as if -- the thought passed through my mind -- I were dying too .
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 32]: `` I always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger brother 's -LRB- as I call him -RRB- having crossed swords with a peasant , and that peasant a boy .
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 29]: The only consideration that appeared to affect the mind of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading to the family , and was ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 30]: As often as I caught the younger brother 's eyes , their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply , for knowing what I knew from the boy .
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 17]: He was smoother and more polite to me than the elder ; but I saw this .
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 17]: I also saw that I was an incumbrance in the mind of the elder , too .
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 30]: `` My patient died , two hours before midnight -- at a time , by my watch , answering almost to the minute when I had first seen her .
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 26]: I was alone with her , when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side , and all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 15]: `` The brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs , impatient to ride away .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 24]: I had heard them , alone at the bedside , striking their boots with their riding-whips , and loitering up and down . ''
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 8]: ` At last she is dead ? '
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 10]: said the elder , when I went in . ''
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 26]: ` She is dead , ' said I. '' ` I congratulate you , my brother , ' were his words as he turned round .
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 14]: `` He had before offered me money , which I had postponed taking .
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 9]: He now gave me a rouleau of gold .
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 14]: I took it from his hand , but laid it on the table .
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 14]: I had considered the question , and had resolved to accept nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 16]: ` Pray excuse me , ' said I. ` Under the circumstances , no . '
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 28]: `` They exchanged looks , but bent their heads to me as I bent mine to them , and we parted without another word on either side .

Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 13]: I can not read what I have written with this gaunt hand .
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 27]: `` Early in the morning , the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a little box , with my name on the outside .
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 14]: From the first , I had anxiously considered what I ought to do .
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 44]: I decided , that day , to write privately to the Minister , stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been summoned , and the place to which I had gone : in effect , stating all the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 38]: I knew what Court influence was , and what the immunities of the Nobles were , and I expected that the matter would never be heard of ; but , I wished to relieve my own mind .
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 27]: I had kept the matter a profound secret , even from my wife ; and this , too , I resolved to state in my letter .
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 34]: I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger ; but I was conscious that there might be danger for others , if others were compromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed .
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 17]: `` I was much engaged that day , and could not complete my letter that night .
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 13]: I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 9]: It was the last day of the year .
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 24]: The letter was lying before me just completed , when I was told that a lady waited , who wished to see me .
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 17]: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- `` I am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself .
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 23]: It is so cold , so dark , my senses are so benumbed , and the gloom upon me is so dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 18]: `` The lady was young , engaging , and handsome , but not marked for long life .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 6]: She was in great agitation .
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 14]: She presented herself to me as the wife of the Marquis St. Evremonde .
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 41]: I connected the title by which the boy had addressed the elder brother , with the initial letter embroidered on the scarf , and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I had seen that nobleman very lately .
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 18]: `` My memory is still accurate , but I can not write the words of our conversation .
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 24]: I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was , and I know not at what times I may be watched .
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 33]: She had in part suspected , and in part discovered , the main facts of the cruel story , of her husband 's share in it , and my being resorted to .
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 10]: She did not know that the girl was dead .
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 23]: Her hope had been , she said in great distress , to show her , in secret , a woman 's sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 23]: Her hope had been to avert the wrath of Heaven from a House that had long been hateful to the suffering many .
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 25]: `` She had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living , and her greatest desire was , to help that sister .
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 20]: I could tell her nothing but that there was such a sister ; beyond that , I knew nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 28]: Her inducement to come to me , relying on my confidence , had been the hope that I could tell her the name and place of abode .
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 12]: Whereas , to this wretched hour I am ignorant of both .
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 9]: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- `` These scraps of paper fail me .
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 12]: One was taken from me , with a warning , yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 7]: I must finish my record to-day .

Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 5]: How could she be !
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 31]: The brother distrusted and disliked her , and his influence was all opposed to her ; she stood in dread of him , and in dread of her husband too .
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 29]: When I handed her down to the door , there was a child , a pretty boy from two to three years old , in her carriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 32]: ` For his sake , Doctor , ' she said , pointing to him in tears , ` I would do all I can to make what poor amends I can .
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 9]: He will never prosper in his inheritance otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 24]: I have a presentiment that if no other innocent atonement is made for this , it will one day be required of him .
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 56]: What I have left to call my own -- it is little beyond the worth of a few jewels -- I will make it the first charge of his life to bestow , with the compassion and lamenting of his dead mother , on this injured family , if the sister can be discovered . '
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 21]: `` She kissed the boy , and said , caressing him , ` It is for thine own dear sake .
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 9]: Thou wilt be faithful , little Charles ? '
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 10]: The child answered her bravely , ` Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 19]: I kissed her hand , and she took him in her arms , and went away caressing him .
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 6]: I never saw her more .
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 27]: `` As she had mentioned her husband 's name in the faith that I knew it , I added no mention of it to my letter .
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 22]: I sealed my letter , and , not trusting it out of my own hands , delivered it myself that day .
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 45]: `` That night , the last night of the year , towards nine o'clock , a man in a black dress rang at my gate , demanded to see me , and softly followed my servant , Ernest Defarge , a youth , up-stairs .
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 23]: When my servant came into the room where I sat with my wife -- O my wife , beloved of my heart !
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 6]: My fair young English wife !
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 20]: -- we saw the man , who was supposed to be at the gate , standing silent behind him .
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 13]: `` An urgent case in the Rue St. Honore , he said .
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 13]: It would not detain me , he had a coach in waiting .
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 13]: `` It brought me here , it brought me to my grave .
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 26]: When I was clear of the house , a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind , and my arms were pinioned .
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 19]: The two brothers crossed the road from a dark corner , and identified me with a single gesture .
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 36]: The Marquis took from his pocket the letter I had written , showed it me , burnt it in the light of a lantern that was held , and extinguished the ashes with his foot .
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 6]: Not a word was spoken .
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 13]: I was brought here , I was brought to my living grave .
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 62]: `` If it had pleased GOD to put it in the hard heart of either of the brothers , in all these frightful years , to grant me any tidings of my dearest wife -- so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or dead -- I might have thought that He had not quite abandoned them .
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 27]: But , now I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them , and that they have no part in His mercies .
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 48]: And them and their descendants , to the last of their race , I , Alexandre Manette , unhappy prisoner , do this last night of the year 1767 , in my unbearable agony , denounce to the times when all these things shall be answered for .
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 10]: I denounce them to Heaven and to earth . ''
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 13]: A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done .
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 15]: A sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but blood .
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 28]: The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time , and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it .
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 43]: Little need , in presence of that tribunal and that auditory , to show how the Defarges had not made the paper public , with the other captured Bastille memorials borne in procession , and had kept it , biding their time .
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 25]: Little need to show that this detested family name had long been anathematised by Saint Antoine , and was wrought into the fatal register .
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 23]: The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have sustained him in that place that day , against such denunciation .
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 28]: And all the worse for the doomed man , that the denouncer was a well-known citizen , his own attached friend , the father of his wife .
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 31]: One of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was , for imitations of the questionable public virtues of antiquity , and for sacrifices and self-immolations on the people 's altar .
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 76]: Therefore when the President said -LRB- else had his own head quivered on his shoulders -RRB- , that the good physician of the Republic would deserve better still of the Republic by rooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats , and would doubtless feel a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an orphan , there was wild excitement , patriotic fervour , not a touch of human sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 11]: `` Much influence around him , has that Doctor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 9]: murmured Madame Defarge , smiling to The Vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 12]: `` Save him now , my Doctor , save him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 11]: At every juryman 's vote , there was a roar .
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 4]: Another and another .
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 4]: Roar and roar .
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 3]: Unanimously voted .
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 21]: At heart and by descent an Aristocrat , an enemy of the Republic , a notorious oppressor of the People .
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 11]: Back to the Conciergerie , and Death within four-and-twenty hours !
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 27]: XI Dusk The wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die , fell under the sentence , as if she had been mortally stricken .
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 48]: But , she uttered no sound ; and so strong was the voice within her , representing that it was she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment it , that it quickly raised her , even from that shock .
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 18]: The Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors , the Tribunal adjourned .
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 39]: The quick noise and movement of the court 's emptying itself by many passages had not ceased , when Lucie stood stretching out her arms towards her husband , with nothing in her face but love and consolation .
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 7]: `` If I might touch him !
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 7]: If I might embrace him once !
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 16]: O , good citizens , if you would have so much compassion for us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 24]: There was but a gaoler left , along with two of the four men who had taken him last night , and Barsad .
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 13]: The people had all poured out to the show in the streets .
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 20]: Barsad proposed to the rest , `` Let her embrace him then ; it is but a moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 37]: It was silently acquiesced in , and they passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place , where he , by leaning over the dock , could fold her in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 9]: `` Farewell , dear darling of my soul .
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 7]: My parting blessing on my love .
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 13]: We shall meet again , where the weary are at rest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 15]: They were her husband 's words , as he held her to his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 9]: `` I can bear it , dear Charles .
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 12]: I am supported from above : do n't suffer for me .
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 8]: A parting blessing for our child . ''
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 9]: `` I send it to her by you .
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 6]: I kiss her by you .
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 9]: I say farewell to her by you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 4]: `` My husband .
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 4]: A moment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 8]: He was tearing himself apart from her .
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 8]: `` We shall not be separated long .
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 41]: I feel that this will break my heart by-and-bye ; but I will do my duty while I can , and when I leave her , God will raise up friends for her , as He did for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 36]: Her father had followed her , and would have fallen on his knees to both of them , but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him , crying : `` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 17]: What have you done , what have you done , that you should kneel to us !
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 12]: We know now , what a struggle you made of old .
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 19]: We know , now what you underwent when you suspected my descent , and when you knew it .
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 19]: We know now , the natural antipathy you strove against , and conquered , for her dear sake .
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 15]: We thank you with all our hearts , and all our love and duty .
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 6]: Heaven be with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 24]: Her father 's only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair , and wring them with a shriek of anguish .
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 12]: `` It could not be otherwise , '' said the prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 12]: `` All things have worked together as they have fallen out .
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 21]: it was the always-vain endeavour to discharge my poor mother 's trust that first brought my fatal presence near you .
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 21]: Good could never come of such evil , a happier end was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning .
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 7]: Be comforted , and forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 5]: Heaven bless you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 46]: As he was drawn away , his wife released him , and stood looking after him with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer , and with a radiant look upon her face , in which there was even a comforting smile .
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 35]: As he went out at the prisoners ' door , she turned , laid her head lovingly on her father 's breast , tried to speak to him , and fell at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 22]: Then , issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved , Sydney Carton came and took her up .
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 10]: Only her father and Mr. Lorry were with her .
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 13]: His arm trembled as it raised her , and supported her head .
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 24]: Yet , there was an air about him that was not all of pity -- that had a flush of pride in it .
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 9]: `` Shall I take her to a coach ?
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 8]: I shall never feel her weight . ''
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 17]: He carried her lightly to the door , and laid her tenderly down in a coach .
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 19]: Her father and their old friend got into it , and he took his seat beside the driver .
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 51]: When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not many hours before , to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of the street her feet had trodden , he lifted her again , and carried her up the staircase to their rooms .
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 20]: There , he laid her down on a couch , where her child and Miss Pross wept over her .
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 24]: `` Do n't recall her to herself , '' he said , softly , to the latter , `` she is better so .
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 13]: Do n't revive her to consciousness , while she only faints . ''
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 11]: `` Oh , Carton , Carton , dear Carton ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 20]: cried little Lucie , springing up and throwing her arms passionately round him , in a burst of grief .
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 22]: `` Now that you have come , I think you will do something to help mamma , something to save papa !
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 9]: O , look at her , dear Carton !
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 18]: Can you , of all the people who love her , bear to see her so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 15]: He bent over the child , and laid her blooming cheek against his face .
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 14]: He put her gently from him , and looked at her unconscious mother .
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 19]: `` Before I go , '' he said , and paused -- `` I may kiss her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 22]: It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips , he murmured some words .
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 38]: The child , who was nearest to him , told them afterwards , and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady , that she heard him say , `` A life you love . ''
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 48]: When he had gone out into the next room , he turned suddenly on Mr. Lorry and her father , who were following , and said to the latter : `` You had great influence but yesterday , Doctor Manette ; let it at least be tried .
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 28]: These judges , and all the men in power , are very friendly to you , and very recognisant of your services ; are they not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 10]: `` Nothing connected with Charles was concealed from me .
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 16]: I had the strongest assurances that I should save him ; and I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 12]: He returned the answer in great trouble , and very slowly .
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 5]: `` Try them again .
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 16]: The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few and short , but try . ''
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 6]: `` I intend to try .
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 8]: I will not rest a moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 5]: `` That 's well .
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 35]: I have known such energy as yours do great things before now -- though never , '' he added , with a smile and a sigh together , `` such great things as this .
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 3]: But try !
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 17]: Of little worth as life is when we misuse it , it is worth that effort .
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 13]: It would cost nothing to lay down if it were not . ''
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 33]: `` I will go , '' said Doctor Manette , `` to the Prosecutor and the President straight , and I will go to others whom it is better not to name .
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 10]: I will write too , and -- But stay !
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 18]: There is a Celebration in the streets , and no one will be accessible until dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 5]: `` That 's true .
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 20]: It is a forlorn hope at the best , and not much the forlorner for being delayed till dark .
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 13]: I should like to know how you speed ; though , mind !
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 4]: I expect nothing !
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 15]: When are you likely to have seen these dread powers , Doctor Manette ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 9]: `` Immediately after dark , I should hope .
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 9]: Within an hour or two from this . ''
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 9]: `` It will be dark soon after four .
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 8]: Let us stretch the hour or two .
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 27]: If I go to Mr. Lorry 's at nine , shall I hear what you have done , either from our friend or from yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 6]: `` May you prosper ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 27]: Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door , and , touching him on the shoulder as he was going away , caused him to turn .
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 18]: `` I have no hope , '' said Mr. Lorry , in a low and sorrowful whisper .
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 44]: `` Nor have I. '' `` If any one of these men , or all of these men , were disposed to spare him -- which is a large supposition ; for what is his life , or any man 's to them !
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 16]: -- I doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the court . ''
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 17]: `` And so do I. I heard the fall of the axe in that sound . ''
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 16]: Mr. Lorry leaned his arm upon the door-post , and bowed his face upon it .
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 17]: `` Do n't despond , '' said Carton , very gently ; `` do n't grieve .
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 21]: I encouraged Doctor Manette in this idea , because I felt that it might one day be consolatory to her .
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 24]: Otherwise , she might think ` his life was want only thrown away or wasted , ' and that might trouble her . ''
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 21]: `` Yes , yes , yes , '' returned Mr. Lorry , drying his eyes , `` you are right .
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 12]: But he will perish ; there is no real hope . ''
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 14]: He will perish : there is no real hope , '' echoed Carton .
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 9]: And walked with a settled step , down-stairs .
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 16]: XII Darkness Sydney Carton paused in the street , not quite decided where to go .
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 17]: `` At Tellson 's banking-house at nine , '' he said , with a musing face .
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 15]: `` Shall I do well , in the mean time , to show myself ?
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 4]: I think so .
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 30]: It is best that these people should know there is such a man as I here ; it is a sound precaution , and may be a necessary preparation .
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 7]: But care , care , care !
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 7]: Let me think it out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 36]: Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object , he took a turn or two in the already darkening street , and traced the thought in his mind to its possible consequences .
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 6]: His first impression was confirmed .
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 28]: `` It is best , '' he said , finally resolved , `` that these people should know there is such a man as I here . ''
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 9]: And he turned his face towards Saint Antoine .
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 20]: Defarge had described himself , that day , as the keeper of a wine-shop in the Saint Antoine suburb .
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 21]: It was not difficult for one who knew the city well , to find his house without asking any question .
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 28]: Having ascertained its situation , Carton came out of those closer streets again , and dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner .
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 14]: For the first time in many years , he had no strong drink .
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 38]: Since last night he had taken nothing but a little light thin wine , and last night he had dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorry 's hearth like a man who had done with it .
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 20]: It was as late as seven o'clock when he awoke refreshed , and went out into the streets again .
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 39]: As he passed along towards Saint Antoine , he stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror , and slightly altered the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat , and his coat-collar , and his wild hair .
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 15]: This done , he went on direct to Defarge 's , and went in .
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 22]: There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three , of the restless fingers and the croaking voice .
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 28]: This man , whom he had seen upon the Jury , stood drinking at the little counter , in conversation with the Defarges , man and wife .
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 15]: The Vengeance assisted in the conversation , like a regular member of the establishment .
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 59]: As Carton walked in , took his seat and asked -LRB- in very indifferent French -RRB- for a small measure of wine , Madame Defarge cast a careless glance at him , and then a keener , and then a keener , and then advanced to him herself , and asked him what it was he had ordered .
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 8]: He repeated what he had already said .
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 4]: `` English ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 10]: asked Madame Defarge , inquisitively raising her dark eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 33]: After looking at her , as if the sound of even a single French word were slow to express itself to him , he answered , in his former strong foreign accent .
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 7]: `` Yes , madame , yes .
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 5]: I am English ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 46]: Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine , and , as he took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its meaning , he heard her say , `` I swear to you , like Evremonde ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 12]: Defarge brought him the wine , and gave him Good Evening .
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 5]: `` Good evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 10]: Good evening , citizen , '' filling his glass .
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 4]: and good wine .
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 7]: I drink to the Republic . ''
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 18]: Defarge went back to the counter , and said , `` Certainly , a little like . ''
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 14]: Madame sternly retorted , `` I tell you a good deal like . ''
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 20]: Jacques Three pacifically remarked , `` He is so much in your mind , see you , madame . ''
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 15]: The amiable Vengeance added , with a laugh , `` Yes , my faith !
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 17]: And you are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more to-morrow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 23]: Carton followed the lines and words of his paper , with a slow forefinger , and with a studious and absorbed face .
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 15]: They were all leaning their arms on the counter close together , speaking low .
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 30]: After a silence of a few moments , during which they all looked towards him without disturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin editor , they resumed their conversation .
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 13]: `` It is true what madame says , '' observed Jacques Three .
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 4]: `` Why stop ?
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 7]: There is great force in that .
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 4]: Why stop ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 16]: `` Well , well , '' reasoned Defarge , `` but one must stop somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 10]: After all , the question is still where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 8]: `` At extermination , '' said madame .
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 4]: `` Magnificent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 4]: croaked Jacques Three .
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 8]: The Vengeance , also , highly approved .
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 26]: `` Extermination is good doctrine , my wife , '' said Defarge , rather troubled ; `` in general , I say nothing against it .
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 25]: But this Doctor has suffered much ; you have seen him to-day ; you have observed his face when the paper was read . ''
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 8]: `` I have observed his face ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 7]: repeated madame , contemptuously and angrily .
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 6]: I have observed his face .
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 18]: I have observed his face to be not the face of a true friend of the Republic .
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 9]: Let him take care of his face ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 35]: `` And you have observed , my wife , '' said Defarge , in a deprecatory manner , `` the anguish of his daughter , which must be a dreadful anguish to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 25]: `` I have observed his daughter , '' repeated madame ; `` yes , I have observed his daughter , more times than one .
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 14]: I have observed her to-day , and I have observed her other days .
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 20]: I have observed her in the court , and I have observed her in the street by the prison .
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 9]: Let me but lift my finger -- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 38]: She seemed to raise it -LRB- the listener 's eyes were always on his paper -RRB- , and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her , as if the axe had dropped .
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 7]: `` The citizeness is superb ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 4]: croaked the Juryman .
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 7]: `` She is an Angel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 8]: said The Vengeance , and embraced her .
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 39]: `` As to thee , '' pursued madame , implacably , addressing her husband , `` if it depended on thee -- which , happily , it does not -- thou wouldst rescue this man even now . ''
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 3]: protested Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 11]: `` Not if to lift this glass would do it !
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 8]: But I would leave the matter there .
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 7]: I say , stop there . ''
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 29]: `` See you then , Jacques , '' said Madame Defarge , wrathfully ; `` and see you , too , my little Vengeance ; see you both !
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 2]: Listen !
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 25]: For other crimes as tyrants and oppressors , I have this race a long time on my register , doomed to destruction and extermination .
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 9]: Ask my husband , is that so . ''
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 13]: `` It is so , '' assented Defarge , without being asked .
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 58]: `` In the beginning of the great days , when the Bastille falls , he finds this paper of to-day , and he brings it home , and in the middle of the night when this place is clear and shut , we read it , here on this spot , by the light of this lamp .
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 8]: Ask him , is that so . ''
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 9]: `` It is so , '' assented Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 46]: `` That night , I tell him , when the paper is read through , and the lamp is burnt out , and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between those iron bars , that I have now a secret to communicate .
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 8]: Ask him , is that so . ''
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 10]: `` It is so , '' assented Defarge again .
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 8]: `` I communicate to him that secret .
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 55]: I smite this bosom with these two hands as I smite it now , and I tell him , ` Defarge , I was brought up among the fishermen of the sea-shore , and that peasant family so injured by the two Evremonde brothers , as that Bastille paper describes , is my family .
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 62]: Defarge , that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground was my sister , that husband was my sister 's husband , that unborn child was their child , that brother was my brother , that father was my father , those dead are my dead , and that summons to answer for those things descends to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 8]: Ask him , is that so . ''
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 11]: `` It is so , '' assented Defarge once more .
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 22]: `` Then tell Wind and Fire where to stop , '' returned madame ; `` but do n't tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 34]: Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature of her wrath -- the listener could feel how white she was , without seeing her -- and both highly commended it .
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 35]: Defarge , a weak minority , interposed a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis ; but only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply .
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 15]: `` Tell the Wind and the Fire where to stop ; not me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 10]: Customers entered , and the group was broken up .
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 30]: The English customer paid for what he had had , perplexedly counted his change , and asked , as a stranger , to be directed towards the National Palace .
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 21]: Madame Defarge took him to the door , and put her arm on his , in pointing out the road .
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 33]: The English customer was not without his reflections then , that it might be a good deed to seize that arm , lift it , and strike under it sharp and deep .
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 20]: But , he went his way , and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the prison wall .
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 33]: At the appointed hour , he emerged from it to present himself in Mr. Lorry 's room again , where he found the old gentleman walking to and fro in restless anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 28]: He said he had been with Lucie until just now , and had only left her for a few minutes , to come and keep his appointment .
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 16]: Her father had not been seen , since he quitted the banking-house towards four o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 18]: She had some faint hopes that his mediation might save Charles , but they were very slight .
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 14]: He had been more than five hours gone : where could he be ?
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 43]: Mr. Lorry waited until ten ; but , Doctor Manette not returning , and he being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer , it was arranged that he should go back to her , and come to the banking-house again at midnight .
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 15]: In the meanwhile , Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 19]: He waited and waited , and the clock struck twelve ; but Doctor Manette did not come back .
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 15]: Mr. Lorry returned , and found no tidings of him , and brought none .
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 5]: Where could he be ?
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 29]: They were discussing this question , and were almost building up some weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence , when they heard him on the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 15]: The instant he entered the room , it was plain that all was lost .
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 25]: Whether he had really been to any one , or whether he had been all that time traversing the streets , was never known .
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 20]: As he stood staring at them , they asked him no question , for his face told them everything .
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 18]: `` I can not find it , '' said he , `` and I must have it .
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 5]: Where is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 34]: His head and throat were bare , and , as he spoke with a helpless look straying all around , he took his coat off , and let it drop on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 6]: `` Where is my bench ?
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 16]: I have been looking everywhere for my bench , and I ca n't find it .
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 8]: What have they done with my work ?
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 10]: Time presses : I must finish those shoes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 13]: They looked at one another , and their hearts died within them .
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 6]: `` Come , come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 16]: said he , in a whimpering miserable way ; `` let me get to work .
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 6]: Give me my work . ''
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 22]: Receiving no answer , he tore his hair , and beat his feet upon the ground , like a distracted child .
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 26]: `` Do n't torture a poor forlorn wretch , '' he implored them , with a dreadful cry ; `` but give me my work !
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 16]: What is to become of us , if those shoes are not done to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 5]: Lost , utterly lost !
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 54]: It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him , or try to restore him , that -- as if by agreement -- they each put a hand upon his shoulder , and soothed him to sit down before the fire , with a promise that he should have his work presently .
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 16]: He sank into the chair , and brooded over the embers , and shed tears .
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 35]: As if all that had happened since the garret time were a momentary fancy , or a dream , Mr. Lorry saw him shrink into the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping .
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 28]: Affected , and impressed with terror as they both were , by this spectacle of ruin , it was not a time to yield to such emotions .
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 19]: His lonely daughter , bereft of her final hope and reliance , appealed to them both too strongly .
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 19]: Again , as if by agreement , they looked at one another with one meaning in their faces .
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 19]: Carton was the first to speak : `` The last chance is gone : it was not much .
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 10]: Yes ; he had better be taken to her .
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 18]: But , before you go , will you , for a moment , steadily attend to me ?
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 35]: Do n't ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make , and exact the promise I am going to exact ; I have a reason -- a good one . ''
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 12]: `` I do not doubt it , '' answered Mr. Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 5]: `` Say on . ''
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 22]: The figure in the chair between them , was all the time monotonously rocking itself to and fro , and moaning .
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 23]: They spoke in such a tone as they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the night .
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 15]: Carton stooped to pick up the coat , which lay almost entangling his feet .
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 30]: As he did so , a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to carry the lists of his day 's duties , fell lightly on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 14]: Carton took it up , and there was a folded paper in it .
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 8]: `` We should look at this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 6]: Mr. Lorry nodded his consent .
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 12]: He opened it , and exclaimed , `` Thank GOD ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 6]: asked Mr. Lorry , eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 4]: `` A moment !
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 9]: Let me speak of it in its place .
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 33]: First , '' he put his hand in his coat , and took another paper from it , `` that is the certificate which enables me to pass out of this city .
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 4]: Look at it .
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 10]: You see -- Sydney Carton , an Englishman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 15]: Mr. Lorry held it open in his hand , gazing in his earnest face .
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 8]: `` Keep it for me until to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 21]: I shall see him to-morrow , you remember , and I had better not take it into the prison . ''
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 13]: `` I do n't know ; I prefer not to do so .
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 13]: Now , take this paper that Doctor Manette has carried about him .
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 27]: It is a similar certificate , enabling him and his daughter and her child , at any time , to pass the barrier and the frontier !
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 4]: You see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 16]: `` Perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil , yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 5]: When is it dated ?
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 20]: But no matter ; do n't stay to look ; put it up carefully with mine and your own .
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 4]: Now , observe !
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 21]: I never doubted until within this hour or two , that he had , or could have such a paper .
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 7]: It is good , until recalled .
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 19]: But it may be soon recalled , and , I have reason to think , will be . ''
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 8]: `` They are not in danger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 7]: `` They are in great danger .
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 10]: They are in danger of denunciation by Madame Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 8]: I know it from her own lips .
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 22]: I have overheard words of that woman 's , to-night , which have presented their danger to me in strong colours .
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 16]: I have lost no time , and since then , I have seen the spy .
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 4]: He confirms me .
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 50]: He knows that a wood-sawyer , living by the prison wall , is under the control of the Defarges , and has been rehearsed by Madame Defarge as to his having seen Her '' -- he never mentioned Lucie 's name -- `` making signs and signals to prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 49]: It is easy to foresee that the pretence will be the common one , a prison plot , and that it will involve her life -- and perhaps her child 's -- and perhaps her father 's -- for both have been seen with her at that place .
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 6]: Do n't look so horrified .
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 7]: You will save them all . ''
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 8]: `` Heaven grant I may , Carton !
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 4]: But how ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 9]: `` I am going to tell you how .
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 15]: It will depend on you , and it could depend on no better man .
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 27]: This new denunciation will certainly not take place until after to-morrow ; probably not until two or three days afterwards ; more probably a week afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 22]: You know it is a capital crime , to mourn for , or sympathise with , a victim of the Guillotine .
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 42]: She and her father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime , and this woman -LRB- the inveteracy of whose pursuit can not be described -RRB- would wait to add that strength to her case , and make herself doubly sure .
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 5]: You follow me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 38]: `` So attentively , and with so much confidence in what you say , that for the moment I lose sight , '' touching the back of the Doctor 's chair , even of this distress . ''
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 24]: `` You have money , and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast as quickly as the journey can be made .
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 14]: Your preparations have been completed for some days , to return to England .
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 23]: Early to-morrow have your horses ready , so that they may be in starting trim at two o'clock in the afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 7]: `` It shall be done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 22]: His manner was so fervent and inspiring , that Mr. Lorry caught the flame , and was as quick as youth .
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 7]: `` You are a noble heart .
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 11]: Did I say we could depend upon no better man ?
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 19]: Tell her , to-night , what you know of her danger as involving her child and her father .
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 19]: Dwell upon that , for she would lay her own fair head beside her husband 's cheerfully . ''
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 12]: He faltered for an instant ; then went on as before .
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 29]: `` For the sake of her child and her father , press upon her the necessity of leaving Paris , with them and you , at that hour .
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 11]: Tell her that it was her husband 's last arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 15]: Tell her that more depends upon it than she dare believe , or hope .
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 23]: You think that her father , even in this sad state , will submit himself to her ; do you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 8]: `` I am sure of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 5]: `` I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 25]: Quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in the courtyard here , even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 16]: The moment I come to you , take me in , and drive away . ''
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 13]: `` I understand that I wait for you under all circumstances ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 21]: `` You have my certificate in your hand with the rest , you know , and will reserve my place .
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 16]: Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied , and then for England ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 45]: `` Why , then , '' said Mr. Lorry , grasping his eager but so firm and steady hand , `` it does not all depend on one old man , but I shall have a young and ardent man at my side . ''
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 9]: `` By the help of Heaven you shall !
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 23]: Promise me solemnly that nothing will influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one another . ''
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 6]: `` Nothing , Carton . ''
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 36]: `` Remember these words to-morrow : change the course , or delay in it -- for any reason -- and no life can possibly be saved , and many lives must inevitably be sacrificed . ''
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 6]: `` I will remember them .
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 9]: I hope to do my part faithfully . ''
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 8]: `` And I hope to do mine .
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 6]: Now , good bye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 33]: Though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness , and though he even put the old man 's hand to his lips , he did not part from him then .
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 48]: He helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers , as to get a cloak and hat put upon it , and to tempt it forth to find where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought to have .
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 44]: He walked on the other side of it and protected it to the courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart -- so happy in the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to it -- outwatched the awful night .
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 25]: He entered the courtyard and remained there for a few moments alone , looking up at the light in the window of her room .
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 16]: Before he went away , he breathed a blessing towards it , and a Farewell .
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 19]: XIII Fifty-two In the black prison of the Conciergerie , the doomed of the day awaited their fate .
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 11]: They were in number as the weeks of the year .
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 18]: Fifty-two were to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless everlasting sea .
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 37]: Before their cells were quit of them , new occupants were appointed ; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday , the blood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set apart .
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 8]: Two score and twelve were told off .
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 29]: From the farmer-general of seventy , whose riches could not buy his life , to the seamstress of twenty , whose poverty and obscurity could not save her .
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 43]: Physical diseases , engendered in the vices and neglects of men , will seize on victims of all degrees ; and the frightful moral disorder , born of unspeakable suffering , intolerable oppression , and heartless indifference , smote equally without distinction .
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 24]: Charles Darnay , alone in a cell , had sustained himself with no flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal .
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 16]: In every line of the narrative he had heard , he had heard his condemnation .
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 30]: He had fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him , that he was virtually sentenced by the millions , and that units could avail him nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 28]: Nevertheless , it was not easy , with the face of his beloved wife fresh before him , to compose his mind to what it must bear .
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 54]: His hold on life was strong , and it was very , very hard , to loosen ; by gradual efforts and degrees unclosed a little here , it clenched the tighter there ; and when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded , this was closed again .
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 26]: There was a hurry , too , in all his thoughts , a turbulent and heated working of his heart , that contended against resignation .
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 34]: If , for a moment , he did feel resigned , then his wife and child who had to live after him , seemed to protest and to make it a selfish thing .
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 8]: But , all this was at first .
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 39]: Before long , the consideration that there was no disgrace in the fate he must meet , and that numbers went the same road wrongfully , and trod it firmly every day , sprang up to stimulate him .
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 24]: Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind enjoyable by the dear ones , depended on his quiet fortitude .
Parsing [sent. 7017 len. 25]: So , by degrees he calmed into the better state , when he could raise his thoughts much higher , and draw comfort down .
Parsing [sent. 7018 len. 23]: Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation , he had travelled thus far on his last way .
Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 29]: Being allowed to purchase the means of writing , and a light , he sat down to write until such time as the prison lamps should be extinguished .
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 58]: He wrote a long letter to Lucie , showing her that he had known nothing of her father 's imprisonment , until he had heard of it from herself , and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father 's and uncle 's responsibility for that misery , until the paper had been read .
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 52]: He had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished , was the one condition -- fully intelligible now -- that her father had attached to their betrothal , and was the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of their marriage .
Parsing [sent. 7022 len. 65]: He entreated her , for her father 's sake , never to seek to know whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper , or had had it recalled to him -LRB- for the moment , or for good -RRB- , by the story of the Tower , on that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 7023 len. 55]: If he had preserved any definite remembrance of it , there could be no doubt that he had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille , when he had found no mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had discovered there , and which had been described to all the world .
Parsing [sent. 7024 len. 57]: He besought her -- though he added that he knew it was needless -- to console her father , by impressing him through every tender means she could think of , with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself , but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes .
Parsing [sent. 7025 len. 44]: Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing , and her overcoming of her sorrow , to devote herself to their dear child , he adjured her , as they would meet in Heaven , to comfort her father .
Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 30]: To her father himself , he wrote in the same strain ; but , he told her father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care .
Parsing [sent. 7027 len. 30]: And he told him this , very strongly , with the hope of rousing him from any despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be tending .
Parsing [sent. 7028 len. 15]: To Mr. Lorry , he commended them all , and explained his worldly affairs .
Parsing [sent. 7029 len. 18]: That done , with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm attachment , all was done .
Parsing [sent. 7030 len. 6]: He never thought of Carton .
Parsing [sent. 7031 len. 17]: His mind was so full of the others , that he never once thought of him .
Parsing [sent. 7032 len. 14]: He had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out .
Parsing [sent. 7033 len. 18]: When he lay down on his straw bed , he thought he had done with this world .
Parsing [sent. 7034 len. 17]: But , it beckoned him back in his sleep , and showed itself in shining forms .
Parsing [sent. 7035 len. 54]: Free and happy , back in the old house in Soho -LRB- though it had nothing in it like the real house -RRB- , unaccountably released and light of heart , he was with Lucie again , and she told him it was all a dream , and he had never gone away .
Parsing [sent. 7036 len. 33]: A pause of forgetfulness , and then he had even suffered , and had come back to her , dead and at peace , and yet there was no difference in him .
Parsing [sent. 7037 len. 39]: Another pause of oblivion , and he awoke in the sombre morning , unconscious where he was or what had happened , until it flashed upon his mind , `` this is the day of my death ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7038 len. 20]: Thus , had he come through the hours , to the day when the fifty-two heads were to fall .
Parsing [sent. 7039 len. 36]: And now , while he was composed , and hoped that he could meet the end with quiet heroism , a new action began in his waking thoughts , which was very difficult to master .
Parsing [sent. 7040 len. 13]: He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life .
Parsing [sent. 7041 len. 79]: How high it was from the ground , how many steps it had , where he would be stood , how he would be touched , whether the touching hands would be dyed red , which way his face would be turned , whether he would be the first , or might be the last : these and many similar questions , in nowise directed by his will , obtruded themselves over and over again , countless times .
Parsing [sent. 7042 len. 14]: Neither were they connected with fear : he was conscious of no fear .
Parsing [sent. 7043 len. 52]: Rather , they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what to do when the time came ; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the few swift moments to which it referred ; a wondering that was more like the wondering of some other spirit within his , than his own .
Parsing [sent. 7044 len. 23]: The hours went on as he walked to and fro , and the clocks struck the numbers he would never hear again .
Parsing [sent. 7045 len. 22]: Nine gone for ever , ten gone for ever , eleven gone for ever , twelve coming on to pass away .
Parsing [sent. 7046 len. 24]: After a hard contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed him , he had got the better of it .
Parsing [sent. 7047 len. 13]: He walked up and down , softly repeating their names to himself .
Parsing [sent. 7048 len. 8]: The worst of the strife was over .
Parsing [sent. 7049 len. 19]: He could walk up and down , free from distracting fancies , praying for himself and for them .
Parsing [sent. 7050 len. 5]: Twelve gone for ever .
Parsing [sent. 7051 len. 34]: He had been apprised that the final hour was Three , and he knew he would be summoned some time earlier , inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily and slowly through the streets .
Parsing [sent. 7052 len. 37]: Therefore , he resolved to keep Two before his mind , as the hour , and so to strengthen himself in the interval that he might be able , after that time , to strengthen others .
Parsing [sent. 7053 len. 42]: Walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast , a very different man from the prisoner , who had walked to and fro at La Force , he heard One struck away from him , without surprise .
Parsing [sent. 7054 len. 9]: The hour had measured like most other hours .
Parsing [sent. 7055 len. 26]: Devoutly thankful to Heaven for his recovered self-possession , he thought , `` There is but another now , '' and turned to walk again .
Parsing [sent. 7056 len. 9]: Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door .
Parsing [sent. 7057 len. 3]: He stopped .
Parsing [sent. 7058 len. 11]: The key was put in the lock , and turned .
Parsing [sent. 7059 len. 38]: Before the door was opened , or as it opened , a man said in a low voice , in English : `` He has never seen me here ; I have kept out of his way .
Parsing [sent. 7060 len. 9]: Go you in alone ; I wait near .
Parsing [sent. 7061 len. 5]: Lose no time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7062 len. 44]: The door was quickly opened and closed , and there stood before him face to face , quiet , intent upon him , with the light of a smile on his features , and a cautionary finger on his lip , Sydney Carton .
Parsing [sent. 7063 len. 31]: There was something so bright and remarkable in his look , that , for the first moment , the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own imagining .
Parsing [sent. 7064 len. 25]: But , he spoke , and it was his voice ; he took the prisoner 's hand , and it was his real grasp .
Parsing [sent. 7065 len. 16]: `` Of all the people upon earth , you least expected to see me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7066 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 7067 len. 10]: `` I could not believe it to be you .
Parsing [sent. 7068 len. 7]: I can scarcely believe it now .
Parsing [sent. 7069 len. 18]: You are not '' -- the apprehension came suddenly into his mind -- `` a prisoner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7070 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 7071 len. 24]: I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers here , and in virtue of it I stand before you .
Parsing [sent. 7072 len. 12]: I come from her -- your wife , dear Darnay . ''
Parsing [sent. 7073 len. 6]: The prisoner wrung his hand .
Parsing [sent. 7074 len. 10]: `` I bring you a request from her . ''
Parsing [sent. 7075 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7076 len. 33]: `` A most earnest , pressing , and emphatic entreaty , addressed to you in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you , that you well remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 7077 len. 8]: The prisoner turned his face partly aside .
Parsing [sent. 7078 len. 26]: `` You have no time to ask me why I bring it , or what it means ; I have no time to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 7079 len. 21]: You must comply with it -- take off those boots you wear , and draw on these of mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 7080 len. 15]: There was a chair against the wall of the cell , behind the prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 7081 len. 27]: Carton , pressing forward , had already , with the speed of lightning , got him down into it , and stood over him , barefoot .
Parsing [sent. 7082 len. 8]: `` Draw on these boots of mine .
Parsing [sent. 7083 len. 12]: Put your hands to them ; put your will to them .
Parsing [sent. 7084 len. 3]: Quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7085 len. 17]: `` Carton , there is no escaping from this place ; it never can be done .
Parsing [sent. 7086 len. 7]: You will only die with me .
Parsing [sent. 7087 len. 5]: It is madness . ''
Parsing [sent. 7088 len. 16]: `` It would be madness if I asked you to escape ; but do I ?
Parsing [sent. 7089 len. 20]: When I ask you to pass out at that door , tell me it is madness and remain here .
Parsing [sent. 7090 len. 15]: Change that cravat for this of mine , that coat for this of mine .
Parsing [sent. 7091 len. 25]: While you do it , let me take this ribbon from your hair , and shake out your hair like this of mine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7092 len. 27]: With wonderful quickness , and with a strength both of will and action , that appeared quite supernatural , he forced all these changes upon him .
Parsing [sent. 7093 len. 11]: The prisoner was like a young child in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 7094 len. 3]: `` Carton !
Parsing [sent. 7095 len. 3]: Dear Carton !
Parsing [sent. 7096 len. 4]: It is madness .
Parsing [sent. 7097 len. 22]: It can not be accomplished , it never can be done , it has been attempted , and has always failed .
Parsing [sent. 7098 len. 15]: I implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 7099 len. 15]: `` Do I ask you , my dear Darnay , to pass the door ?
Parsing [sent. 7100 len. 7]: When I ask that , refuse .
Parsing [sent. 7101 len. 11]: There are pen and ink and paper on this table .
Parsing [sent. 7102 len. 9]: Is your hand steady enough to write ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7103 len. 9]: `` It was when you came in . ''
Parsing [sent. 7104 len. 12]: `` Steady it again , and write what I shall dictate .
Parsing [sent. 7105 len. 7]: Quick , friend , quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7106 len. 15]: Pressing his hand to his bewildered head , Darnay sat down at the table .
Parsing [sent. 7107 len. 15]: Carton , with his right hand in his breast , stood close beside him .
Parsing [sent. 7108 len. 8]: `` Write exactly as I speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 7109 len. 9]: `` To whom do I address it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7110 len. 6]: `` To no one . ''
Parsing [sent. 7111 len. 9]: Carton still had his hand in his breast .
Parsing [sent. 7112 len. 7]: `` Do I date it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7113 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 7114 len. 9]: The prisoner looked up , at each question .
Parsing [sent. 7115 len. 16]: Carton , standing over him with his hand in his breast , looked down . ''
Parsing [sent. 7116 len. 34]: ` If you remember , ' '' said Carton , dictating , '' ` the words that passed between us , long ago , you will readily comprehend this when you see it .
Parsing [sent. 7117 len. 8]: You do remember them , I know .
Parsing [sent. 7118 len. 12]: It is not in your nature to forget them . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 7119 len. 31]: He was drawing his hand from his breast ; the prisoner chancing to look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote , the hand stopped , closing upon something .
Parsing [sent. 7120 len. 10]: `` Have you written ` forget them ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7121 len. 3]: Carton asked .
Parsing [sent. 7122 len. 4]: `` I have .
Parsing [sent. 7123 len. 9]: Is that a weapon in your hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7124 len. 9]: `` No ; I am not armed . ''
Parsing [sent. 7125 len. 9]: `` What is it in your hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7126 len. 6]: `` You shall know directly .
Parsing [sent. 7127 len. 12]: Write on ; there are but a few words more . ''
Parsing [sent. 7128 len. 5]: He dictated again . ''
Parsing [sent. 7129 len. 16]: ` I am thankful that the time has come , when I can prove them .
Parsing [sent. 7130 len. 14]: That I do so is no subject for regret or grief . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 7131 len. 27]: As he said these words with his eyes fixed on the writer , his hand slowly and softly moved down close to the writer 's face .
Parsing [sent. 7132 len. 18]: The pen dropped from Darnay 's fingers on the table , and he looked about him vacantly .
Parsing [sent. 7133 len. 7]: `` What vapour is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7134 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 7135 len. 4]: `` Vapour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7136 len. 7]: `` Something that crossed me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7137 len. 13]: `` I am conscious of nothing ; there can be nothing here .
Parsing [sent. 7138 len. 7]: Take up the pen and finish .
Parsing [sent. 7139 len. 5]: Hurry , hurry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7140 len. 22]: As if his memory were impaired , or his faculties disordered , the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention .
Parsing [sent. 7141 len. 30]: As he looked at Carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing , Carton -- his hand again in his breast -- looked steadily at him .
Parsing [sent. 7142 len. 6]: `` Hurry , hurry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7143 len. 11]: The prisoner bent over the paper , once more . ''
Parsing [sent. 7144 len. 31]: ` If it had been otherwise ; ' '' Carton 's hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down ; '' ` I never should have used the longer opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 7145 len. 32]: If it had been otherwise ; ' '' the hand was at the prisoner 's face ; '' ` I should but have had so much the more to answer for .
Parsing [sent. 7146 len. 23]: If it had been otherwise -- ' '' Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs .
Parsing [sent. 7147 len. 11]: Carton 's hand moved back to his breast no more .
Parsing [sent. 7148 len. 32]: The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look , but Carton 's hand was close and firm at his nostrils , and Carton 's left arm caught him round the waist .
Parsing [sent. 7149 len. 37]: For a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his life for him ; but , within a minute or so , he was stretched insensible on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 7150 len. 43]: Quickly , but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was , Carton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside , combed back his hair , and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn .
Parsing [sent. 7151 len. 10]: Then , he softly called , `` Enter there !
Parsing [sent. 7152 len. 4]: Come in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7153 len. 6]: and the Spy presented himself .
Parsing [sent. 7154 len. 5]: `` You see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7155 len. 32]: said Carton , looking up , as he kneeled on one knee beside the insensible figure , putting the paper in the breast : `` is your hazard very great ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7156 len. 43]: `` Mr. Carton , '' the Spy answered , with a timid snap of his fingers , `` my hazard is not THAT , in the thick of business here , if you are true to the whole of your bargain . ''
Parsing [sent. 7157 len. 6]: `` Do n't fear me .
Parsing [sent. 7158 len. 9]: I will be true to the death . ''
Parsing [sent. 7159 len. 18]: `` You must be , Mr. Carton , if the tale of fifty-two is to be right .
Parsing [sent. 7160 len. 16]: Being made right by you in that dress , I shall have no fear . ''
Parsing [sent. 7161 len. 5]: `` Have no fear !
Parsing [sent. 7162 len. 25]: I shall soon be out of the way of harming you , and the rest will soon be far from here , please God !
Parsing [sent. 7163 len. 12]: Now , get assistance and take me to the coach . ''
Parsing [sent. 7164 len. 4]: `` You ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7165 len. 5]: said the Spy nervously .
Parsing [sent. 7166 len. 11]: `` Him , man , with whom I have exchanged .
Parsing [sent. 7167 len. 14]: You go out at the gate by which you brought me in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7168 len. 5]: `` Of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 7169 len. 22]: `` I was weak and faint when you brought me in , and I am fainter now you take me out .
Parsing [sent. 7170 len. 7]: The parting interview has overpowered me .
Parsing [sent. 7171 len. 13]: Such a thing has happened here , often , and too often .
Parsing [sent. 7172 len. 8]: Your life is in your own hands .
Parsing [sent. 7173 len. 2]: Quick !
Parsing [sent. 7174 len. 4]: Call assistance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7175 len. 9]: `` You swear not to betray me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7176 len. 13]: said the trembling Spy , as he paused for a last moment .
Parsing [sent. 7177 len. 6]: `` Man , man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7178 len. 31]: returned Carton , stamping his foot ; `` have I sworn by no solemn vow already , to go through with this , that you waste the precious moments now ?
Parsing [sent. 7179 len. 56]: Take him yourself to the courtyard you know of , place him yourself in the carriage , show him yourself to Mr. Lorry , tell him yourself to give him no restorative but air , and to remember my words of last night , and his promise of last night , and drive away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7180 len. 19]: The Spy withdrew , and Carton seated himself at the table , resting his forehead on his hands .
Parsing [sent. 7181 len. 9]: The Spy returned immediately , with two men .
Parsing [sent. 7182 len. 6]: `` How , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7183 len. 10]: said one of them , contemplating the fallen figure .
Parsing [sent. 7184 len. 20]: `` So afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of Sainte Guillotine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7185 len. 26]: `` A good patriot , '' said the other , `` could hardly have been more afflicted if the Aristocrat had drawn a blank . ''
Parsing [sent. 7186 len. 25]: They raised the unconscious figure , placed it on a litter they had brought to the door , and bent to carry it away .
Parsing [sent. 7187 len. 18]: `` The time is short , Evremonde , '' said the Spy , in a warning voice .
Parsing [sent. 7188 len. 10]: `` I know it well , '' answered Carton .
Parsing [sent. 7189 len. 16]: `` Be careful of my friend , I entreat you , and leave me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7190 len. 12]: `` Come , then , my children , '' said Barsad .
Parsing [sent. 7191 len. 9]: `` Lift him , and come away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7192 len. 10]: The door closed , and Carton was left alone .
Parsing [sent. 7193 len. 21]: Straining his powers of listening to the utmost , he listened for any sound that might denote suspicion or alarm .
Parsing [sent. 7194 len. 4]: There was none .
Parsing [sent. 7195 len. 25]: Keys turned , doors clashed , footsteps passed along distant passages : no cry was raised , or hurry made , that seemed unusual .
Parsing [sent. 7196 len. 24]: Breathing more freely in a little while , he sat down at the table , and listened again until the clock struck Two .
Parsing [sent. 7197 len. 20]: Sounds that he was not afraid of , for he divined their meaning , then began to be audible .
Parsing [sent. 7198 len. 12]: Several doors were opened in succession , and finally his own .
Parsing [sent. 7199 len. 23]: A gaoler , with a list in his hand , looked in , merely saying , `` Follow me , Evremonde ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7200 len. 13]: and he followed into a large dark room , at a distance .
Parsing [sent. 7201 len. 38]: It was a dark winter day , and what with the shadows within , and what with the shadows without , he could but dimly discern the others who were brought there to have their arms bound .
Parsing [sent. 7202 len. 7]: Some were standing ; some seated .
Parsing [sent. 7203 len. 15]: Some were lamenting , and in restless motion ; but , these were few .
Parsing [sent. 7204 len. 14]: The great majority were silent and still , looking fixedly at the ground .
Parsing [sent. 7205 len. 39]: As he stood by the wall in a dim corner , while some of the fifty-two were brought in after him , one man stopped in passing , to embrace him , as having a knowledge of him .
Parsing [sent. 7206 len. 16]: It thrilled him with a great dread of discovery ; but the man went on .
Parsing [sent. 7207 len. 55]: A very few moments after that , a young woman , with a slight girlish form , a sweet spare face in which there was no vestige of colour , and large widely opened patient eyes , rose from the seat where he had observed her sitting , and came to speak to him .
Parsing [sent. 7208 len. 15]: `` Citizen Evremonde , '' she said , touching him with her cold hand .
Parsing [sent. 7209 len. 17]: `` I am a poor little seamstress , who was with you in La Force . ''
Parsing [sent. 7210 len. 8]: He murmured for answer : `` True .
Parsing [sent. 7211 len. 9]: I forget what you were accused of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7212 len. 3]: `` Plots .
Parsing [sent. 7213 len. 12]: Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any .
Parsing [sent. 7214 len. 4]: Is it likely ?
Parsing [sent. 7215 len. 15]: Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7216 len. 20]: The forlorn smile with which she said it , so touched him , that tears started from his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7217 len. 17]: `` I am not afraid to die , Citizen Evremonde , but I have done nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7218 len. 40]: I am not unwilling to die , if the Republic which is to do so much good to us poor , will profit by my death ; but I do not know how that can be , Citizen Evremonde .
Parsing [sent. 7219 len. 8]: Such a poor weak little creature ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7220 len. 25]: As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to , it warmed and softened to this pitiable girl .
Parsing [sent. 7221 len. 10]: `` I heard you were released , Citizen Evremonde .
Parsing [sent. 7222 len. 7]: I hoped it was true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7223 len. 4]: `` It was .
Parsing [sent. 7224 len. 10]: But , I was again taken and condemned . ''
Parsing [sent. 7225 len. 19]: `` If I may ride with you , Citizen Evremonde , will you let me hold your hand ?
Parsing [sent. 7226 len. 21]: I am not afraid , but I am little and weak , and it will give me more courage . ''
Parsing [sent. 7227 len. 22]: As the patient eyes were lifted to his face , he saw a sudden doubt in them , and then astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 7228 len. 14]: He pressed the work-worn , hunger-worn young fingers , and touched his lips .
Parsing [sent. 7229 len. 8]: `` Are you dying for him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7230 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 7231 len. 7]: `` And his wife and child .
Parsing [sent. 7232 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 7233 len. 3]: Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 7234 len. 14]: `` O you will let me hold your brave hand , stranger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7235 len. 3]: `` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 7236 len. 11]: Yes , my poor sister ; to the last . ''
Parsing [sent. 7237 len. 44]: The same shadows that are falling on the prison , are falling , in that same hour of the early afternoon , on the Barrier with the crowd about it , when a coach going out of Paris drives up to be examined .
Parsing [sent. 7238 len. 5]: `` Who goes here ?
Parsing [sent. 7239 len. 5]: Whom have we within ?
Parsing [sent. 7240 len. 3]: Papers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7241 len. 9]: The papers are handed out , and read .
Parsing [sent. 7242 len. 4]: `` Alexandre Manette .
Parsing [sent. 7243 len. 2]: Physician .
Parsing [sent. 7244 len. 2]: French .
Parsing [sent. 7245 len. 5]: Which is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7246 len. 16]: This is he ; this helpless , inarticulately murmuring , wandering old man pointed out .
Parsing [sent. 7247 len. 13]: `` Apparently the Citizen -- Doctor is not in his right mind ?
Parsing [sent. 7248 len. 11]: The Revolution-fever will have been too much for him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7249 len. 6]: Greatly too much for him .
Parsing [sent. 7250 len. 3]: `` Hah !
Parsing [sent. 7251 len. 5]: Many suffer with it .
Parsing [sent. 7252 len. 2]: Lucie .
Parsing [sent. 7253 len. 3]: His daughter .
Parsing [sent. 7254 len. 2]: French .
Parsing [sent. 7255 len. 5]: Which is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7256 len. 4]: This is she .
Parsing [sent. 7257 len. 6]: `` Apparently it must be .
Parsing [sent. 7258 len. 12]: Lucie , the wife of Evremonde ; is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7259 len. 3]: It is .
Parsing [sent. 7260 len. 3]: `` Hah !
Parsing [sent. 7261 len. 6]: Evremonde has an assignation elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 7262 len. 5]: Lucie , her child .
Parsing [sent. 7263 len. 2]: English .
Parsing [sent. 7264 len. 5]: This is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7265 len. 5]: She and no other .
Parsing [sent. 7266 len. 8]: `` Kiss me , child of Evremonde .
Parsing [sent. 7267 len. 18]: Now , thou hast kissed a good Republican ; something new in thy family ; remember it !
Parsing [sent. 7268 len. 3]: Sydney Carton .
Parsing [sent. 7269 len. 2]: Advocate .
Parsing [sent. 7270 len. 2]: English .
Parsing [sent. 7271 len. 5]: Which is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7272 len. 11]: He lies here , in this corner of the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 7273 len. 8]: He , too , is pointed out .
Parsing [sent. 7274 len. 11]: `` Apparently the English advocate is in a swoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7275 len. 11]: It is hoped he will recover in the fresher air .
Parsing [sent. 7276 len. 27]: It is represented that he is not in strong health , and has separated sadly from a friend who is under the displeasure of the Republic .
Parsing [sent. 7277 len. 5]: `` Is that all ?
Parsing [sent. 7278 len. 9]: It is not a great deal , that !
Parsing [sent. 7279 len. 18]: Many are under the displeasure of the Republic , and must look out at the little window .
Parsing [sent. 7280 len. 3]: Jarvis Lorry .
Parsing [sent. 7281 len. 2]: Banker .
Parsing [sent. 7282 len. 2]: English .
Parsing [sent. 7283 len. 5]: Which is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7284 len. 5]: `` I am he .
Parsing [sent. 7285 len. 7]: Necessarily , being the last . ''
Parsing [sent. 7286 len. 13]: It is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all the previous questions .
Parsing [sent. 7287 len. 24]: It is Jarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach door , replying to a group of officials .
Parsing [sent. 7288 len. 74]: They leisurely walk round the carriage and leisurely mount the box , to look at what little luggage it carries on the roof ; the country-people hanging about , press nearer to the coach doors and greedily stare in ; a little child , carried by its mother , has its short arm held out for it , that it may touch the wife of an aristocrat who has gone to the Guillotine .
Parsing [sent. 7289 len. 11]: `` Behold your papers , Jarvis Lorry , countersigned . ''
Parsing [sent. 7290 len. 8]: `` One can depart , citizen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7291 len. 5]: `` One can depart .
Parsing [sent. 7292 len. 5]: Forward , my postilions !
Parsing [sent. 7293 len. 5]: A good journey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7294 len. 7]: `` I salute you , citizens .
Parsing [sent. 7295 len. 8]: -- And the first danger passed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7296 len. 19]: These are again the words of Jarvis Lorry , as he clasps his hands , and looks upward .
Parsing [sent. 7297 len. 21]: There is terror in the carriage , there is weeping , there is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller .
Parsing [sent. 7298 len. 8]: `` Are we not going too slowly ?
Parsing [sent. 7299 len. 10]: Can they not be induced to go faster ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7300 len. 9]: asks Lucie , clinging to the old man .
Parsing [sent. 7301 len. 10]: `` It would seem like flight , my darling .
Parsing [sent. 7302 len. 14]: I must not urge them too much ; it would rouse suspicion . ''
Parsing [sent. 7303 len. 15]: `` Look back , look back , and see if we are pursued ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7304 len. 9]: `` The road is clear , my dearest .
Parsing [sent. 7305 len. 9]: So far , we are not pursued . ''
Parsing [sent. 7306 len. 31]: Houses in twos and threes pass by us , solitary farms , ruinous buildings , dye-works , tanneries , and the like , open country , avenues of leafless trees .
Parsing [sent. 7307 len. 17]: The hard uneven pavement is under us , the soft deep mud is on either side .
Parsing [sent. 7308 len. 30]: Sometimes , we strike into the skirting mud , to avoid the stones that clatter us and shake us ; sometimes , we stick in ruts and sloughs there .
Parsing [sent. 7309 len. 32]: The agony of our impatience is then so great , that in our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running -- hiding -- doing anything but stopping .
Parsing [sent. 7310 len. 34]: Out of the open country , in again among ruinous buildings , solitary farms , dye-works , tanneries , and the like , cottages in twos and threes , avenues of leafless trees .
Parsing [sent. 7311 len. 14]: Have these men deceived us , and taken us back by another road ?
Parsing [sent. 7312 len. 9]: Is not this the same place twice over ?
Parsing [sent. 7313 len. 5]: Thank Heaven , no .
Parsing [sent. 7314 len. 3]: A village .
Parsing [sent. 7315 len. 13]: Look back , look back , and see if we are pursued !
Parsing [sent. 7316 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 7317 len. 3]: the posting-house .
Parsing [sent. 7318 len. 83]: Leisurely , our four horses are taken out ; leisurely , the coach stands in the little street , bereft of horses , and with no likelihood upon it of ever moving again ; leisurely , the new horses come into visible existence , one by one ; leisurely , the new postilions follow , sucking and plaiting the lashes of their whips ; leisurely , the old postilions count their money , make wrong additions , and arrive at dissatisfied results .
Parsing [sent. 7319 len. 26]: All the time , our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled .
Parsing [sent. 7320 len. 17]: At length the new postilions are in their saddles , and the old are left behind .
Parsing [sent. 7321 len. 22]: We are through the village , up the hill , and down the hill , and on the low watery grounds .
Parsing [sent. 7322 len. 22]: Suddenly , the postilions exchange speech with animated gesticulation , and the horses are pulled up , almost on their haunches .
Parsing [sent. 7323 len. 4]: We are pursued ?
Parsing [sent. 7324 len. 3]: `` Ho !
Parsing [sent. 7325 len. 5]: Within the carriage there .
Parsing [sent. 7326 len. 4]: Speak then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7327 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7328 len. 9]: asks Mr. Lorry , looking out at window .
Parsing [sent. 7329 len. 8]: `` How many did they say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7330 len. 9]: `` I do not understand you . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 7331 len. 6]: -- At the last post .
Parsing [sent. 7332 len. 8]: How many to the Guillotine to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7333 len. 4]: `` Fifty-two . ''
Parsing [sent. 7334 len. 5]: `` I said so !
Parsing [sent. 7335 len. 4]: A brave number !
Parsing [sent. 7336 len. 15]: My fellow-citizen here would have it forty-two ; ten more heads are worth having .
Parsing [sent. 7337 len. 5]: The Guillotine goes handsomely .
Parsing [sent. 7338 len. 4]: I love it .
Parsing [sent. 7339 len. 3]: Hi forward .
Parsing [sent. 7340 len. 3]: Whoop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7341 len. 6]: The night comes on dark .
Parsing [sent. 7342 len. 37]: He moves more ; he is beginning to revive , and to speak intelligibly ; he thinks they are still together ; he asks him , by his name , what he has in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 7343 len. 11]: O pity us , kind Heaven , and help us !
Parsing [sent. 7344 len. 13]: Look out , look out , and see if we are pursued .
Parsing [sent. 7345 len. 46]: The wind is rushing after us , and the clouds are flying after us , and the moon is plunging after us , and the whole wild night is in pursuit of us ; but , so far , we are pursued by nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 7346 len. 35]: XIV The Knitting Done In that same juncture of time when the Fifty -- Two awaited their fate Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury .
Parsing [sent. 7347 len. 26]: Not in the wine-shop did Madame Defarge confer with these ministers , but in the shed of the wood-sawyer , erst a mender of roads .
Parsing [sent. 7348 len. 37]: The sawyer himself did not participate in the conference , but abided at a little distance , like an outer satellite who was not to speak until required , or to offer an opinion until invited .
Parsing [sent. 7349 len. 17]: `` But our Defarge , '' said Jacques Three , `` is undoubtedly a good Republican ?
Parsing [sent. 7350 len. 3]: Eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7351 len. 21]: `` There is no better , '' the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill notes , `` in France . ''
Parsing [sent. 7352 len. 29]: `` Peace , little Vengeance , '' said Madame Defarge , laying her hand with a slight frown on her lieutenant 's lips , `` hear me speak .
Parsing [sent. 7353 len. 27]: My husband , fellow-citizen , is a good Republican and a bold man ; he has deserved well of the Republic , and possesses its confidence .
Parsing [sent. 7354 len. 20]: But my husband has his weaknesses , and he is so weak as to relent towards this Doctor . ''
Parsing [sent. 7355 len. 44]: `` It is a great pity , '' croaked Jacques Three , dubiously shaking his head , with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth ; `` it is not quite like a good citizen ; it is a thing to regret . ''
Parsing [sent. 7356 len. 18]: `` See you , '' said madame , `` I care nothing for this Doctor , I .
Parsing [sent. 7357 len. 24]: He may wear his head or lose it , for any interest I have in him ; it is all one to me .
Parsing [sent. 7358 len. 23]: But , the Evremonde people are to be exterminated , and the wife and child must follow the husband and father . ''
Parsing [sent. 7359 len. 14]: `` She has a fine head for it , '' croaked Jacques Three .
Parsing [sent. 7360 len. 22]: `` I have seen blue eyes and golden hair there , and they looked charming when Samson held them up . ''
Parsing [sent. 7361 len. 11]: Ogre that he was , he spoke like an epicure .
Parsing [sent. 7362 len. 12]: Madame Defarge cast down her eyes , and reflected a little .
Parsing [sent. 7363 len. 26]: `` The child also , '' observed Jacques Three , with a meditative enjoyment of his words , `` has golden hair and blue eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7364 len. 8]: And we seldom have a child there .
Parsing [sent. 7365 len. 7]: It is a pretty sight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7366 len. 28]: `` In a word , '' said Madame Defarge , coming out of her short abstraction , `` I can not trust my husband in this matter .
Parsing [sent. 7367 len. 47]: Not only do I feel , since last night , that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects ; but also I feel that if I delay , there is danger of his giving warning , and then they might escape . ''
Parsing [sent. 7368 len. 17]: `` That must never be , '' croaked Jacques Three ; `` no one must escape .
Parsing [sent. 7369 len. 9]: We have not half enough as it is .
Parsing [sent. 7370 len. 10]: We ought to have six score a day . ''
Parsing [sent. 7371 len. 39]: `` In a word , '' Madame Defarge went on , `` my husband has not my reason for pursuing this family to annihilation , and I have not his reason for regarding this Doctor with any sensibility .
Parsing [sent. 7372 len. 8]: I must act for myself , therefore .
Parsing [sent. 7373 len. 7]: Come hither , little citizen . ''
Parsing [sent. 7374 len. 29]: The wood-sawyer , who held her in the respect , and himself in the submission , of mortal fear , advanced with his hand to his red cap .
Parsing [sent. 7375 len. 36]: `` Touching those signals , little citizen , '' said Madame Defarge , sternly , `` that she made to the prisoners ; you are ready to bear witness to them this very day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7376 len. 9]: `` Ay , ay , why not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7377 len. 4]: cried the sawyer .
Parsing [sent. 7378 len. 25]: `` Every day , in all weathers , from two to four , always signalling , sometimes with the little one , sometimes without .
Parsing [sent. 7379 len. 6]: I know what I know .
Parsing [sent. 7380 len. 8]: I have seen with my eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 7381 len. 30]: He made all manner of gestures while he spoke , as if in incidental imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had never seen .
Parsing [sent. 7382 len. 9]: `` Clearly plots , '' said Jacques Three .
Parsing [sent. 7383 len. 4]: `` Transparently ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7384 len. 10]: `` There is no doubt of the Jury ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7385 len. 15]: inquired Madame Defarge , letting her eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile .
Parsing [sent. 7386 len. 10]: `` Rely upon the patriotic Jury , dear citizeness .
Parsing [sent. 7387 len. 9]: I answer for my fellow -- Jurymen . ''
Parsing [sent. 7388 len. 15]: `` Now , let me see , '' said Madame Defarge , pondering again .
Parsing [sent. 7389 len. 5]: `` Yet once more !
Parsing [sent. 7390 len. 9]: Can I spare this Doctor to my husband ?
Parsing [sent. 7391 len. 7]: I have no feeling either way .
Parsing [sent. 7392 len. 6]: Can I spare him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7393 len. 18]: `` He would count as one head , '' observed Jacques Three , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 7394 len. 18]: `` We really have not heads enough ; it would be a pity , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 7395 len. 47]: `` He was signalling with her when I saw her , '' argued Madame Defarge ; `` I can not speak of one without the other ; and I must not be silent , and trust the case wholly to him , this little citizen here .
Parsing [sent. 7396 len. 10]: For , I am not a bad witness . ''
Parsing [sent. 7397 len. 24]: The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of witnesses .
Parsing [sent. 7398 len. 17]: The little citizen , not to be outdone , declared her to be a celestial witness .
Parsing [sent. 7399 len. 12]: `` He must take his chance , '' said Madame Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 7400 len. 9]: `` No , I can not spare him !
Parsing [sent. 7401 len. 18]: You are engaged at three o'clock ; you are going to see the batch of to-day executed .
Parsing [sent. 7402 len. 4]: -- You ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7403 len. 64]: The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer , who hurriedly replied in the affirmative : seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent of Republicans , and that he would be in effect the most desolate of Republicans , if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national barber .
Parsing [sent. 7404 len. 51]: He was so very demonstrative herein , that he might have been suspected -LRB- perhaps was , by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at him out of Madame Defarge 's head -RRB- of having his small individual fears for his own personal safety , every hour in the day .
Parsing [sent. 7405 len. 16]: `` I , '' said madame , `` am equally engaged at the same place .
Parsing [sent. 7406 len. 30]: After it is over-say at eight to-night -- come you to me , in Saint Antoine , and we will give information against these people at my Section . ''
Parsing [sent. 7407 len. 14]: The wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the citizeness .
Parsing [sent. 7408 len. 37]: The citizeness looking at him , he became embarrassed , evaded her glance as a small dog would have done , retreated among his wood , and hid his confusion over the handle of his saw .
Parsing [sent. 7409 len. 40]: Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to the door , and there expounded her further views to them thus : `` She will now be at home , awaiting the moment of his death .
Parsing [sent. 7410 len. 7]: She will be mourning and grieving .
Parsing [sent. 7411 len. 16]: She will be in a state of mind to impeach the justice of the Republic .
Parsing [sent. 7412 len. 10]: She will be full of sympathy with its enemies .
Parsing [sent. 7413 len. 7]: I will go to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 7414 len. 12]: `` What an admirable woman ; what an adorable woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7415 len. 6]: exclaimed Jacques Three , rapturously .
Parsing [sent. 7416 len. 7]: `` Ah , my cherished ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7417 len. 8]: cried The Vengeance ; and embraced her .
Parsing [sent. 7418 len. 31]: `` Take you my knitting , '' said Madame Defarge , placing it in her lieutenant 's hands , `` and have it ready for me in my usual seat .
Parsing [sent. 7419 len. 6]: Keep me my usual chair .
Parsing [sent. 7420 len. 20]: Go you there , straight , for there will probably be a greater concourse than usual , to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 7421 len. 22]: `` I willingly obey the orders of my Chief , '' said The Vengeance with alacrity , and kissing her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 7422 len. 8]: `` You will not be late ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7423 len. 10]: `` I shall be there before the commencement . ''
Parsing [sent. 7424 len. 7]: `` And before the tumbrils arrive .
Parsing [sent. 7425 len. 34]: Be sure you are there , my soul , '' said The Vengeance , calling after her , for she had already turned into the street , `` before the tumbrils arrive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7426 len. 40]: Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand , to imply that she heard , and might be relied upon to arrive in good time , and so went through the mud , and round the corner of the prison wall .
Parsing [sent. 7427 len. 28]: The Vengeance and the Juryman , looking after her as she walked away , were highly appreciative of her fine figure , and her superb moral endowments .
Parsing [sent. 7428 len. 43]: There were many women at that time , upon whom the time laid a dreadfully disfiguring hand ; but , there was not one among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman , now taking her way along the streets .
Parsing [sent. 7429 len. 60]: Of a strong and fearless character , of shrewd sense and readiness , of great determination , of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity , but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualities ; the troubled time would have heaved her up , under any circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 7430 len. 29]: But , imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong , and an inveterate hatred of a class , opportunity had developed her into a tigress .
Parsing [sent. 7431 len. 6]: She was absolutely without pity .
Parsing [sent. 7432 len. 18]: If she had ever had the virtue in her , it had quite gone out of her .
Parsing [sent. 7433 len. 29]: It was nothing to her , that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers ; she saw , not him , but them .
Parsing [sent. 7434 len. 45]: It was nothing to her , that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan ; that was insufficient punishment , because they were her natural enemies and her prey , and as such had no right to live .
Parsing [sent. 7435 len. 20]: To appeal to her , was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity , even for herself .
Parsing [sent. 7436 len. 67]: If she had been laid low in the streets , in any of the many encounters in which she had been engaged , she would not have pitied herself ; nor , if she had been ordered to the axe to-morrow , would she have gone to it with any softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who sent here there .
Parsing [sent. 7437 len. 11]: Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe .
Parsing [sent. 7438 len. 28]: Carelessly worn , it was a becoming robe enough , in a certain weird way , and her dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap .
Parsing [sent. 7439 len. 11]: Lying hidden in her bosom , was a loaded pistol .
Parsing [sent. 7440 len. 11]: Lying hidden at her waist , was a sharpened dagger .
Parsing [sent. 7441 len. 48]: Thus accoutred , and walking with the confident tread of such a character , and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood , bare-foot and bare-legged , on the brown sea-sand , Madame Defarge took her way along the streets .
Parsing [sent. 7442 len. 45]: Now , when the journey of the travelling coach , at that very moment waiting for the completion of its load , had been planned out last night , the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry 's attention .
Parsing [sent. 7443 len. 53]: It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach , but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining it and its passengers , should be reduced to the utmost ; since their escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there .
Parsing [sent. 7444 len. 40]: Finally , he had proposed , after anxious consideration , that Miss Pross and Jerry , who were at liberty to leave the city , should leave it at three o'clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period .
Parsing [sent. 7445 len. 51]: Unencumbered with luggage , they would soon overtake the coach , and , passing it and preceding it on the road , would order its horses in advance , and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours of the night , when delay was the most to be dreaded .
Parsing [sent. 7446 len. 22]: Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that pressing emergency , Miss Pross hailed it with joy .
Parsing [sent. 7447 len. 67]: She and Jerry had beheld the coach start , had known who it was that Solomon brought , had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense , and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach , even as Madame Defarge , taking her way through the streets , now drew nearer and nearer to the else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation .
Parsing [sent. 7448 len. 48]: `` Now what do you think , Mr. Cruncher , '' said Miss Pross , whose agitation was so great that she could hardly speak , or stand , or move , or live : `` what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard ?
Parsing [sent. 7449 len. 15]: Another carriage having already gone from here to-day , it might awaken suspicion . ''
Parsing [sent. 7450 len. 18]: `` My opinion , miss , '' returned Mr. Cruncher , `` is as you 're right .
Parsing [sent. 7451 len. 13]: Likewise wot I 'll stand by you , right or wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 7452 len. 32]: `` I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures , '' said Miss Pross , wildly crying , `` that I am incapable of forming any plan .
Parsing [sent. 7453 len. 15]: Are YOU capable of forming any plan , my dear good Mr. Cruncher ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7454 len. 22]: `` Respectin ' a future spear o ' life , miss , '' returned Mr. Cruncher , `` I hope so .
Parsing [sent. 7455 len. 20]: Respectin ' any present use o ' this here blessed old head o ' mind , I think not .
Parsing [sent. 7456 len. 32]: Would you do me the favour , miss , to take notice o ' two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here crisis ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7457 len. 8]: `` Oh , for gracious sake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7458 len. 28]: cried Miss Pross , still wildly crying , `` record them at once , and get them out of the way , like an excellent man . ''
Parsing [sent. 7459 len. 48]: `` First , '' said Mr. Cruncher , who was all in a tremble , and who spoke with an ashy and solemn visage , `` them poor things well out o ' this , never no more will I do it , never no more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7460 len. 45]: `` I am quite sure , Mr. Cruncher , '' returned Miss Pross , `` that you never will do it again , whatever it is , and I beg you not to think it necessary to mention more particularly what it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 7461 len. 18]: `` No , miss , '' returned Jerry , `` it shall not be named to you .
Parsing [sent. 7462 len. 29]: Second : them poor things well out o ' this , and never no more will I interfere with Mrs. Cruncher 's flopping , never no more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7463 len. 42]: `` Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be , '' said Miss Pross , striving to dry her eyes and compose herself , `` I have no doubt it is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own superintendence .
Parsing [sent. 7464 len. 7]: -- O my poor darlings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7465 len. 82]: `` I go so far as to say , miss , moreover , '' proceeded Mr. Cruncher , with a most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit -- `` and let my words be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself -- that wot my opinions respectin ' flopping has undergone a change , and that wot I only hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present time . ''
Parsing [sent. 7466 len. 7]: `` There , there , there !
Parsing [sent. 7467 len. 28]: I hope she is , my dear man , '' cried the distracted Miss Pross , `` and I hope she finds it answering her expectations . ''
Parsing [sent. 7468 len. 49]: `` Forbid it , '' proceeded Mr. Cruncher , with additional solemnity , additional slowness , and additional tendency to hold forth and hold out , `` as anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now !
Parsing [sent. 7469 len. 26]: Forbid it as we should n't all flop -LRB- if it was anyways conwenient -RRB- to get 'em out o ' this here dismal risk !
Parsing [sent. 7470 len. 5]: Forbid it , miss !
Parsing [sent. 7471 len. 10]: Wot I say , for -- BID it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7472 len. 18]: This was Mr. Cruncher 's conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one .
Parsing [sent. 7473 len. 17]: And still Madame Defarge , pursuing her way along the streets , came nearer and nearer .
Parsing [sent. 7474 len. 68]: `` If we ever get back to our native land , '' said Miss Pross , `` you may rely upon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and understand of what you have so impressively said ; and at all events you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time .
Parsing [sent. 7475 len. 7]: Now , pray let us think !
Parsing [sent. 7476 len. 10]: My esteemed Mr. Cruncher , let us think ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7477 len. 17]: Still , Madame Defarge , pursuing her way along the streets , came nearer and nearer .
Parsing [sent. 7478 len. 39]: `` If you were to go before , '' said Miss Pross , `` and stop the vehicle and horses from coming here , and were to wait somewhere for me ; would n't that be best ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7479 len. 8]: Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best .
Parsing [sent. 7480 len. 9]: `` Where could you wait for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7481 len. 4]: asked Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 7482 len. 16]: Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but Temple Bar .
Parsing [sent. 7483 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 7484 len. 17]: Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away , and Madame Defarge was drawing very near indeed .
Parsing [sent. 7485 len. 11]: `` By the cathedral door , '' said Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 7486 len. 26]: `` Would it be much out of the way , to take me in , near the great cathedral door between the two towers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7487 len. 10]: `` No , miss , '' answered Mr. Cruncher .
Parsing [sent. 7488 len. 27]: `` Then , like the best of men , '' said Miss Pross , `` go to the posting-house straight , and make that change . ''
Parsing [sent. 7489 len. 25]: `` I am doubtful , '' said Mr. Cruncher , hesitating and shaking his head , `` about leaving of you , you see .
Parsing [sent. 7490 len. 9]: We do n't know what may happen . ''
Parsing [sent. 7491 len. 20]: `` Heaven knows we do n't , '' returned Miss Pross , `` but have no fear for me .
Parsing [sent. 7492 len. 33]: Take me in at the cathedral , at Three o'Clock , or as near it as you can , and I am sure it will be better than our going from here .
Parsing [sent. 7493 len. 6]: I feel certain of it .
Parsing [sent. 7494 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 7495 len. 6]: Bless you , Mr. Cruncher !
Parsing [sent. 7496 len. 17]: Think-not of me , but of the lives that may depend on both of us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7497 len. 20]: This exordium , and Miss Pross 's two hands in quite agonised entreaty clasping his , decided Mr. Cruncher .
Parsing [sent. 7498 len. 28]: With an encouraging nod or two , he immediately went out to alter the arrangements , and left her by herself to follow as she had proposed .
Parsing [sent. 7499 len. 21]: The having originated a precaution which was already in course of execution , was a great relief to Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 7500 len. 22]: The necessity of composing her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets , was another relief .
Parsing [sent. 7501 len. 14]: She looked at her watch , and it was twenty minutes past two .
Parsing [sent. 7502 len. 14]: She had no time to lose , but must get ready at once .
Parsing [sent. 7503 len. 48]: Afraid , in her extreme perturbation , of the loneliness of the deserted rooms , and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door in them , Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes , which were swollen and red .
Parsing [sent. 7504 len. 42]: Haunted by her feverish apprehensions , she could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the dripping water , but constantly paused and looked round to see that there was no one watching her .
Parsing [sent. 7505 len. 21]: In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried out , for she saw a figure standing in the room .
Parsing [sent. 7506 len. 19]: The basin fell to the ground broken , and the water flowed to the feet of Madame Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 7507 len. 20]: By strange stern ways , and through much staining blood , those feet had come to meet that water .
Parsing [sent. 7508 len. 21]: Madame Defarge looked coldly at her , and said , `` The wife of Evremonde ; where is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7509 len. 21]: It flashed upon Miss Pross 's mind that the doors were all standing open , and would suggest the flight .
Parsing [sent. 7510 len. 8]: Her first act was to shut them .
Parsing [sent. 7511 len. 13]: There were four in the room , and she shut them all .
Parsing [sent. 7512 len. 15]: She then placed herself before the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied .
Parsing [sent. 7513 len. 21]: Madame Defarge 's dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement , and rested on her when it was finished .
Parsing [sent. 7514 len. 49]: Miss Pross had nothing beautiful about her ; years had not tamed the wildness , or softened the grimness , of her appearance ; but , she too was a determined woman in her different way , and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes , every inch .
Parsing [sent. 7515 len. 23]: `` You might , from your appearance , be the wife of Lucifer , '' said Miss Pross , in her breathing .
Parsing [sent. 7516 len. 12]: `` Nevertheless , you shall not get the better of me .
Parsing [sent. 7517 len. 6]: I am an Englishwoman . ''
Parsing [sent. 7518 len. 24]: Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully , but still with something of Miss Pross 's own perception that they two were at bay .
Parsing [sent. 7519 len. 34]: She saw a tight , hard , wiry woman before her , as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a woman with a strong hand , in the years gone by .
Parsing [sent. 7520 len. 29]: She knew full well that Miss Pross was the family 's devoted friend ; Miss Pross knew full well that Madame Defarge was the family 's malevolent enemy .
Parsing [sent. 7521 len. 47]: `` On my way yonder , '' said Madame Defarge , with a slight movement of her hand towards the fatal spot , `` where they reserve my chair and my knitting for me , I am come to make my compliments to her in passing .
Parsing [sent. 7522 len. 7]: I wish to see her . ''
Parsing [sent. 7523 len. 31]: `` I know that your intentions are evil , '' said Miss Pross , `` and you may depend upon it , I 'll hold my own against them . ''
Parsing [sent. 7524 len. 34]: Each spoke in her own language ; neither understood the other 's words ; both were very watchful , and intent to deduce from look and manner , what the unintelligible words meant .
Parsing [sent. 7525 len. 22]: `` It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this moment , '' said Madame Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 7526 len. 9]: `` Good patriots will know what that means .
Parsing [sent. 7527 len. 5]: Let me see her .
Parsing [sent. 7528 len. 10]: Go tell her that I wish to see her .
Parsing [sent. 7529 len. 5]: Do you hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7530 len. 31]: `` If those eyes of yours were bed-winches , '' returned Miss Pross , `` and I was an English four-poster , they should n't loose a splinter of me .
Parsing [sent. 7531 len. 13]: No , you wicked foreign woman ; I am your match . ''
Parsing [sent. 7532 len. 30]: Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in detail ; but , she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set at naught .
Parsing [sent. 7533 len. 7]: `` Woman imbecile and pig-like ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7534 len. 6]: said Madame Defarge , frowning .
Parsing [sent. 7535 len. 8]: `` I take no answer from you .
Parsing [sent. 7536 len. 6]: I demand to see her .
Parsing [sent. 7537 len. 27]: Either tell her that I demand to see her , or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7538 len. 12]: This , with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm .
Parsing [sent. 7539 len. 51]: `` I little thought , '' said Miss Pross , `` that I should ever want to understand your nonsensical language ; but I would give all I have , except the clothes I wear , to know whether you suspect the truth , or any part of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7540 len. 13]: Neither of them for a single moment released the other 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7541 len. 28]: Madame Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when Miss Pross first became aware of her ; but , she now advanced one step .
Parsing [sent. 7542 len. 16]: `` I am a Briton , '' said Miss Pross , `` I am desperate .
Parsing [sent. 7543 len. 10]: I do n't care an English Twopence for myself .
Parsing [sent. 7544 len. 19]: I know that the longer I keep you here , the greater hope there is for my Ladybird .
Parsing [sent. 7545 len. 23]: I 'll not leave a handful of that dark hair upon your head , if you lay a finger on me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7546 len. 29]: Thus Miss Pross , with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes between every rapid sentence , and every rapid sentence a whole breath .
Parsing [sent. 7547 len. 14]: Thus Miss Pross , who had never struck a blow in her life .
Parsing [sent. 7548 len. 19]: But , her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the irrepressible tears into her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7549 len. 16]: This was a courage that Madame Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness .
Parsing [sent. 7550 len. 6]: `` Ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7551 len. 8]: she laughed , `` you poor wretch !
Parsing [sent. 7552 len. 5]: What are you worth !
Parsing [sent. 7553 len. 8]: I address myself to that Doctor . ''
Parsing [sent. 7554 len. 13]: Then she raised her voice and called out , `` Citizen Doctor !
Parsing [sent. 7555 len. 4]: Wife of Evremonde !
Parsing [sent. 7556 len. 4]: Child of Evremonde !
Parsing [sent. 7557 len. 13]: Any person but this miserable fool , answer the Citizeness Defarge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7558 len. 36]: Perhaps the following silence , perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of Miss Pross 's face , perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion , whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone .
Parsing [sent. 7559 len. 12]: Three of the doors she opened swiftly , and looked in .
Parsing [sent. 7560 len. 23]: `` Those rooms are all in disorder , there has been hurried packing , there are odds and ends upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 7561 len. 10]: There is no one in that room behind you !
Parsing [sent. 7562 len. 5]: Let me look . ''
Parsing [sent. 7563 len. 4]: `` Never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7564 len. 17]: said Miss Pross , who understood the request as perfectly as Madame Defarge understood the answer .
Parsing [sent. 7565 len. 28]: `` If they are not in that room , they are gone , and can be pursued and brought back , '' said Madame Defarge to herself .
Parsing [sent. 7566 len. 68]: `` As long as you do n't know whether they are in that room or not , you are uncertain what to do , '' said Miss Pross to herself ; `` and you shall not know that , if I can prevent your knowing it ; and know that , or not know that , you shall not leave here while I can hold you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7567 len. 37]: `` I have been in the streets from the first , nothing has stopped me , I will tear you to pieces , but I will have you from that door , '' said Madame Defarge .
Parsing [sent. 7568 len. 56]: `` We are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard , we are not likely to be heard , and I pray for bodily strength to keep you here , while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to my darling , '' said Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 7569 len. 7]: Madame Defarge made at the door .
Parsing [sent. 7570 len. 25]: Miss Pross , on the instinct of the moment , seized her round the waist in both her arms , and held her tight .
Parsing [sent. 7571 len. 48]: It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike ; Miss Pross , with the vigorous tenacity of love , always so much stronger than hate , clasped her tight , and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle that they had .
Parsing [sent. 7572 len. 42]: The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her face ; but , Miss Pross , with her head down , held her round the waist , and clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman .
Parsing [sent. 7573 len. 17]: Soon , Madame Defarge 's hands ceased to strike , and felt at her encircled waist .
Parsing [sent. 7574 len. 23]: `` It is under my arm , '' said Miss Pross , in smothered tones , `` you shall not draw it .
Parsing [sent. 7575 len. 12]: I am stronger than you , I bless Heaven for it .
Parsing [sent. 7576 len. 14]: I hold you till one or other of us faints or dies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7577 len. 9]: Madame Defarge 's hands were at her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 7578 len. 30]: Miss Pross looked up , saw what it was , struck at it , struck out a flash and a crash , and stood alone -- blinded with smoke .
Parsing [sent. 7579 len. 7]: All this was in a second .
Parsing [sent. 7580 len. 32]: As the smoke cleared , leaving an awful stillness , it passed out on the air , like the soul of the furious woman whose body lay lifeless on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 7581 len. 34]: In the first fright and horror of her situation , Miss Pross passed the body as far from it as she could , and ran down the stairs to call for fruitless help .
Parsing [sent. 7582 len. 22]: Happily , she bethought herself of the consequences of what she did , in time to check herself and go back .
Parsing [sent. 7583 len. 36]: It was dreadful to go in at the door again ; but , she did go in , and even went near it , to get the bonnet and other things that she must wear .
Parsing [sent. 7584 len. 22]: These she put on , out on the staircase , first shutting and locking the door and taking away the key .
Parsing [sent. 7585 len. 24]: She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe and to cry , and then got up and hurried away .
Parsing [sent. 7586 len. 24]: By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet , or she could hardly have gone along the streets without being stopped .
Parsing [sent. 7587 len. 23]: By good fortune , too , she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement like any other woman .
Parsing [sent. 7588 len. 41]: She needed both advantages , for the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face , and her hair was torn , and her dress -LRB- hastily composed with unsteady hands -RRB- was clutched and dragged a hundred ways .
Parsing [sent. 7589 len. 14]: In crossing the bridge , she dropped the door key in the river .
Parsing [sent. 7590 len. 64]: Arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort , and waiting there , she thought , what if the key were already taken in a net , what if it were identified , what if the door were opened and the remains discovered , what if she were stopped at the gate , sent to prison , and charged with murder !
Parsing [sent. 7591 len. 21]: In the midst of these fluttering thoughts , the escort appeared , took her in , and took her away .
Parsing [sent. 7592 len. 10]: `` Is there any noise in the streets ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7593 len. 4]: she asked him .
Parsing [sent. 7594 len. 21]: `` The usual noises , '' Mr. Cruncher replied ; and looked surprised by the question and by her aspect .
Parsing [sent. 7595 len. 12]: `` I do n't hear you , '' said Miss Pross .
Parsing [sent. 7596 len. 7]: `` What do you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7597 len. 20]: It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said ; Miss Pross could not hear him .
Parsing [sent. 7598 len. 25]: `` So I 'll nod my head , '' thought Mr. Cruncher , amazed , `` at all events she 'll see that . ''
Parsing [sent. 7599 len. 4]: And she did .
Parsing [sent. 7600 len. 11]: `` Is there any noise in the streets now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7601 len. 7]: asked Miss Pross again , presently .
Parsing [sent. 7602 len. 7]: Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head .
Parsing [sent. 7603 len. 8]: `` I do n't hear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7604 len. 8]: `` Gone deaf in an hour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7605 len. 20]: said Mr. Cruncher , ruminating , with his mind much disturbed ; `` wot 's come to her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7606 len. 37]: `` I feel , '' said Miss Pross , `` as if there had been a flash and a crash , and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life . ''
Parsing [sent. 7607 len. 12]: `` Blest if she ai n't in a queer condition ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7608 len. 9]: said Mr. Cruncher , more and more disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 7609 len. 16]: `` Wot can she have been a takin ' , to keep her courage up ?
Parsing [sent. 7610 len. 2]: Hark !
Parsing [sent. 7611 len. 9]: There 's the roll of them dreadful carts !
Parsing [sent. 7612 len. 8]: You can hear that , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7613 len. 20]: `` I can hear , '' said Miss Pross , seeing that he spoke to her , `` nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7614 len. 43]: O , my good man , there was first a great crash , and then a great stillness , and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable , never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts . ''
Parsing [sent. 7615 len. 49]: `` If she do n't hear the roll of those dreadful carts , now very nigh their journey 's end , '' said Mr. Cruncher , glancing over his shoulder , `` it 's my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world . ''
Parsing [sent. 7616 len. 6]: And indeed she never did .
Parsing [sent. 7617 len. 20]: XV The Footsteps Die Out For Ever Along the Paris streets , the death-carts rumble , hollow and harsh .
Parsing [sent. 7618 len. 11]: Six tumbrils carry the day 's wine to La Guillotine .
Parsing [sent. 7619 len. 22]: All the devouring and insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself , are fused in the one realisation , Guillotine .
Parsing [sent. 7620 len. 49]: And yet there is not in France , with its rich variety of soil and climate , a blade , a leaf , a root , a sprig , a peppercorn , which will grow to maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror .
Parsing [sent. 7621 len. 23]: Crush humanity out of shape once more , under similar hammers , and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms .
Parsing [sent. 7622 len. 25]: Sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again , and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind .
Parsing [sent. 7623 len. 7]: Six tumbrils roll along the streets .
Parsing [sent. 7624 len. 62]: Change these back again to what they were , thou powerful enchanter , Time , and they shall be seen to be the carriages of absolute monarchs , the equipages of feudal nobles , the toilettes of flaring Jezebels , the churches that are not my father 's house but dens of thieves , the huts of millions of starving peasants !
Parsing [sent. 7625 len. 21]: No ; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order of the Creator , never reverses his transformations .
Parsing [sent. 7626 len. 33]: `` If thou be changed into this shape by the will of God , '' say the seers to the enchanted , in the wise Arabian stories , `` then remain so !
Parsing [sent. 7627 len. 19]: But , if thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration , then resume thy former aspect ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7628 len. 9]: Changeless and hopeless , the tumbrils roll along .
Parsing [sent. 7629 len. 27]: As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round , they seem to plough up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets .
Parsing [sent. 7630 len. 19]: Ridges of faces are thrown to this side and to that , and the ploughs go steadily onward .
Parsing [sent. 7631 len. 47]: So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle , that in many windows there are no people , and in some the occupation of the hands is not so much as suspended , while the eyes survey the faces in the tumbrils .
Parsing [sent. 7632 len. 54]: Here and there , the inmate has visitors to see the sight ; then he points his finger , with something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent , to this cart and to this , and seems to tell who sat here yesterday , and who there the day before .
Parsing [sent. 7633 len. 39]: Of the riders in the tumbrils , some observe these things , and all things on their last roadside , with an impassive stare ; others , with a lingering interest in the ways of life and men .
Parsing [sent. 7634 len. 42]: Some , seated with drooping heads , are sunk in silent despair ; again , there are some so heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as they have seen in theatres , and in pictures .
Parsing [sent. 7635 len. 17]: Several close their eyes , and think , or try to get their straying thoughts together .
Parsing [sent. 7636 len. 32]: Only one , and he a miserable creature , of a crazed aspect , is so shattered and made drunk by horror , that he sings , and tries to dance .
Parsing [sent. 7637 len. 19]: Not one of the whole number appeals by look or gesture , to the pity of the people .
Parsing [sent. 7638 len. 31]: There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils , and faces are often turned up to some of them , and they are asked some question .
Parsing [sent. 7639 len. 26]: It would seem to be always the same question , for , it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart .
Parsing [sent. 7640 len. 18]: The horsemen abreast of that cart , frequently point out one man in it with their swords .
Parsing [sent. 7641 len. 45]: The leading curiosity is , to know which is he ; he stands at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down , to converse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart , and holds his hand .
Parsing [sent. 7642 len. 19]: He has no curiosity or care for the scene about him , and always speaks to the girl .
Parsing [sent. 7643 len. 17]: Here and there in the long street of St. Honore , cries are raised against him .
Parsing [sent. 7644 len. 28]: If they move him at all , it is only to a quiet smile , as he shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face .
Parsing [sent. 7645 len. 13]: He can not easily touch his face , his arms being bound .
Parsing [sent. 7646 len. 20]: On the steps of a church , awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils , stands the Spy and prison-sheep .
Parsing [sent. 7647 len. 11]: He looks into the first of them : not there .
Parsing [sent. 7648 len. 9]: He looks into the second : not there .
Parsing [sent. 7649 len. 12]: He already asks himself , `` Has he sacrificed me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7650 len. 12]: when his face clears , as he looks into the third .
Parsing [sent. 7651 len. 6]: `` Which is Evremonde ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7652 len. 6]: says a man behind him .
Parsing [sent. 7653 len. 3]: `` That .
Parsing [sent. 7654 len. 6]: At the back there . ''
Parsing [sent. 7655 len. 10]: `` With his hand in the girl 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7656 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 7657 len. 9]: The man cries , `` Down , Evremonde !
Parsing [sent. 7658 len. 6]: To the Guillotine all aristocrats !
Parsing [sent. 7659 len. 5]: Down , Evremonde ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7660 len. 6]: `` Hush , hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7661 len. 7]: the Spy entreats him , timidly .
Parsing [sent. 7662 len. 8]: `` And why not , citizen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7663 len. 18]: `` He is going to pay the forfeit : it will be paid in five minutes more .
Parsing [sent. 7664 len. 7]: Let him be at peace . ''
Parsing [sent. 7665 len. 13]: But the man continuing to exclaim , `` Down , Evremonde ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7666 len. 12]: the face of Evremonde is for a moment turned towards him .
Parsing [sent. 7667 len. 17]: Evremonde then sees the Spy , and looks attentively at him , and goes his way .
Parsing [sent. 7668 len. 32]: The clocks are on the stroke of three , and the furrow ploughed among the populace is turning round , to come on into the place of execution , and end .
Parsing [sent. 7669 len. 32]: The ridges thrown to this side and to that , now crumble in and close behind the last plough as it passes on , for all are following to the Guillotine .
Parsing [sent. 7670 len. 26]: In front of it , seated in chairs , as in a garden of public diversion , are a number of women , busily knitting .
Parsing [sent. 7671 len. 17]: On one of the fore-most chairs , stands The Vengeance , looking about for her friend .
Parsing [sent. 7672 len. 4]: `` Therese ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7673 len. 8]: she cries , in her shrill tones .
Parsing [sent. 7674 len. 6]: `` Who has seen her ?
Parsing [sent. 7675 len. 4]: Therese Defarge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7676 len. 14]: `` She never missed before , '' says a knitting-woman of the sisterhood .
Parsing [sent. 7677 len. 16]: `` No ; nor will she miss now , '' cries The Vengeance , petulantly .
Parsing [sent. 7678 len. 4]: `` Therese . ''
Parsing [sent. 7679 len. 8]: `` Louder , '' the woman recommends .
Parsing [sent. 7680 len. 2]: Ay !
Parsing [sent. 7681 len. 15]: Louder , Vengeance , much louder , and still she will scarcely hear thee .
Parsing [sent. 7682 len. 21]: Louder yet , Vengeance , with a little oath or so added , and yet it will hardly bring her .
Parsing [sent. 7683 len. 41]: Send other women up and down to seek her , lingering somewhere ; and yet , although the messengers have done dread deeds , it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far enough to find her !
Parsing [sent. 7684 len. 5]: `` Bad Fortune ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7685 len. 18]: cries The Vengeance , stamping her foot in the chair , `` and here are the tumbrils !
Parsing [sent. 7686 len. 14]: And Evremonde will be despatched in a wink , and she not here !
Parsing [sent. 7687 len. 15]: See her knitting in my hand , and her empty chair ready for her .
Parsing [sent. 7688 len. 8]: I cry with vexation and disappointment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7689 len. 19]: As The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it , the tumbrils begin to discharge their loads .
Parsing [sent. 7690 len. 10]: The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are robed and ready .
Parsing [sent. 7691 len. 2]: Crash !
Parsing [sent. 7692 len. 32]: -- A head is held up , and the knitting-women who scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could think and speak , count One .
Parsing [sent. 7693 len. 13]: The second tumbril empties and moves on ; the third comes up .
Parsing [sent. 7694 len. 2]: Crash !
Parsing [sent. 7695 len. 16]: -- And the knitting-women , never faltering or pausing in their Work , count Two .
Parsing [sent. 7696 len. 15]: The supposed Evremonde descends , and the seamstress is lifted out next after him .
Parsing [sent. 7697 len. 19]: He has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out , but still holds it as he promised .
Parsing [sent. 7698 len. 28]: He gently places her with her back to the crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls , and she looks into his face and thanks him .
Parsing [sent. 7699 len. 56]: `` But for you , dear stranger , I should not be so composed , for I am naturally a poor little thing , faint of heart ; nor should I have been able to raise my thoughts to Him who was put to death , that we might have hope and comfort here to-day .

Parsing [sent. 7704 len. 16]: I shall mind nothing when I let it go , if they are rapid . ''
Parsing [sent. 7705 len. 6]: `` They will be rapid .
Parsing [sent. 7706 len. 4]: Fear not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7707 len. 19]: The two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims , but they speak as if they were alone .
Parsing [sent. 7708 len. 51]: Eye to eye , voice to voice , hand to hand , heart to heart , these two children of the Universal Mother , else so wide apart and differing , have come together on the dark highway , to repair home together , and to rest in her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 7709 len. 16]: `` Brave and generous friend , will you let me ask you one last question ?
Parsing [sent. 7710 len. 15]: I am very ignorant , and it troubles me -- just a little . ''

Parsing [sent. 7716 len. 11]: `` Yes , yes : better as it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 7717 len. 80]: `` What I have been thinking as we came along , and what I am still thinking now , as I look into your kind strong face which gives me so much support , is this : -- If the Republic really does good to the poor , and they come to be less hungry , and in all ways to suffer less , she may live a long time : she may even live to be old . ''
Parsing [sent. 7718 len. 9]: `` What then , my gentle sister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7719 len. 62]: `` Do you think : '' the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much endurance , fill with tears , and the lips part a little more and tremble : `` that it will seem long to me , while I wait for her in the better land where I trust both you and I will be mercifully sheltered ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7720 len. 21]: `` It can not be , my child ; there is no Time there , and no trouble there . ''
Parsing [sent. 7721 len. 7]: `` You comfort me so much !
Parsing [sent. 7722 len. 5]: I am so ignorant .
Parsing [sent. 7723 len. 7]: Am I to kiss you now ?
