Parsing [sent. 1 len. 18]: The Silent Barrier BY LOUIS TRACY THE SILENT BARRIER CHAPTER I THE WISH `` Mail in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 8]: `` Yes , sir ; just arrived .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 4]: What name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 6]: `` Charles K. Spencer . ''
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 15]: The letter clerk seized a batch of correspondence and sorted it with nimble fingers .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 29]: The form of the question told him that Spencer was interested in letters stamped for the greater part with bland presentments of bygone Presidents of the United States .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 39]: In any event , he would have known , by long experience of the type , that the well dressed , straight limbed , strong faced young man on the other side of the counter was an American .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 8]: He withdrew four missives from the bundle .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 18]: His quick eyes saw that three bore the Denver postmark , and the fourth hailed from Leadville .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 13]: `` That is all at present , sir , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 21]: `` Would you like your mail sent to your room in future , or shall I keep it here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 11]: `` Right here , please , in No. 20 slot .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 18]: I could receive a reply by cable while I was going and coming along my corridor . ''
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 5]: The clerk smiled deferentially .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 26]: He appreciated not only the length of the corridor , but the price paid by the tenant of a second floor suite overlooking the river .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 48]: `` Very well , sir , '' he said , glancing again at Spencer , `` I will attend to it ; '' and he took a mental portrait of the man who could afford to hire apartments that ranked among the most expensive in the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 9]: Obviously , the American was a recent arrival .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 26]: His suite had been vacated by a Frankfort banker only three days earlier , and this was the first time he had asked for letters .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 69]: Even the disillusioned official was amused by the difference between the two latest occupants of No. 20 , -- Herr Bamberger , a tub of a man , bald headed and bespectacled , and this alert , sinewy youngster , with the cleancut features of a Greek statue , and the brilliant , deep set , earnest eyes of one to whom thought and action were alike familiar .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 60]: Spencer , fully aware that he was posing for a necessary picture , examined the dates on his letters , nipped the end off a green cigar , helped himself to a match from a box tendered by a watchful boy , crossed the entrance hall , and descended a few steps leading to the inner foyer and restaurant .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 14]: At the foot of the stairs he looked about for a quiet corner .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 7]: The luncheon hour was almost ended .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 25]: Groups of smokers and coffee drinkers were scattered throughout the larger room , which widened out below a second short flight of carpeted steps .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 39]: The smaller anteroom in which he stood was empty , save for a few people passing that way from the restaurant , and he decided that a nook near a palm shaded balcony offered the retreat he sought .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 40]: He little dreamed that he was choosing the starting point of the most thrilling adventure in a life already adventurous ; that the soft carpet of the Embankment Hotel might waft him to scenes not within the common scope .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 9]: That is ever the way of true romance .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 62]: Your knight errant may wander in the forest for a day or a year , -- he never knows the moment when the enchanted glade shall open before his eyes ; nay , he scarce has seen the weeping maiden bound to a tree ere he is called in to couch his lance and ride a-tilt at the fire breathing dragon .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 29]: It was so when men and maids dwelt in a young world ; it is so now ; and it will be so till the crack of doom .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 21]: Manners may change , and costume ; but hearts filled with the wine of life are not to be altered .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 29]: They are fashioned that way , and the world does not vary , else Eve might regain Paradise , and all the fret and fume have an end .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 44]: Charles K. Spencer , then , would certainly have been the most astonished , though perhaps the most self possessed , man in London had some guardian sprite whispered low in his ear what strange hazard lay in his choice of a chair .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 12]: If such whisper were vouchsafed to him he paid no heed .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 10]: Perhaps his occupancy of that particular corner was preordained .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 40]: It was inviting , secluded , an upholstered backwash in the stream of fashion ; so he sat there , nearly stunned a waiter by asking for a glass of water , and composed himself to read his letters .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 4]: The waiter hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 13]: He was a Frenchman , and feared he had not heard aright .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 22]: `` What sort of water , sir , '' he asked , -- `` Vichy , St. Galmier , Apollinaris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 4]: Spencer looked up .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 7]: He thought the man had gone .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 11]: `` No , none of those , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 32]: `` Just plain , unemotional water , -- _ eau naturelle _ , -- straight from the pipe , -- the microbe laden fluid that runs off London tiles most days .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 35]: I have n't been outside the hotel during the last hour ; but if you happen to pass the door I guess you 'll see the kind of essence I mean dripping off umbrellas .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 26]: If you do n't keep it in the house , try to borrow a policeman 's cape and shoot a quart into a decanter . ''
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 10]: The quelled waiter hurried away and brought a carafe .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 17]: Spencer professed to be so pleased with his rare intelligence that he gave him a shilling .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 10]: Then he opened the envelop with the Leadville postmark .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 54]: It contained a draft for 205 pounds , 15 shillings , 11 pence , and the accompanying letter from a firm of solicitors showed that the remittance of a thousand dollars was the moiety of the proceeds of a clean-up on certain tailings taken over by the purchasers of the Battle Mountain tunnel .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 42]: The sum was not a large one ; but it seemed to give its recipient such satisfaction that the movement of chairs on the floor of the big room just beneath failed to draw his attention from the lawyer 's statement .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 16]: A woman 's languid , well bred voice broke in on this apparently pleasant reverie .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 9]: `` Shall we sit here , Helen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 7]: `` Anywhere you like , dear .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 8]: It is all the same to me .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 12]: Thanks to you , I am passing an afternoon in wonderland .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 25]: I find my surroundings so novel and entertaining that I should still be excited if you were to put me in the refrigerator . ''
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 52]: The eager vivacity of the second speaker -- the note of undiluted and almost childlike glee with which she acknowledged that a visit to a luxurious hotel was a red letter day in her life -- caused the man to glance at the two young women who had unconsciously disturbed him .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 21]: Evidently , they had just risen from luncheon in the restaurant , and meant to dispose themselves for a chat .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 20]: It was equally clear that each word they uttered in an ordinary conversational tone must be audible to him .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 20]: They were appropriating chairs which would place the plumes of their hats within a few inches of his feet .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 28]: When seated , their faces would be hidden from him , save for a possible glimpse of a profile as one or other turned toward her companion .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 26]: But for a few seconds he had a good view of both , and he was young enough to find the scrutiny to his liking .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 22]: At the first glance , the girl who was acting as hostess might be deemed the more attractive of the pair .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 22]: She was tall , slender , charmingly dressed , and carried herself with an assured elegance that hinted of the stage .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 54]: Spencer caught a glint of corn flower blue eyes beneath long lashes , and a woman would have deduced from their color the correct explanation of a blue sunshade , a blue straw hat , and a light cape of Myosotis blue silk that fell from shapely shoulders over a white lace gown .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 39]: The other girl , -- she who answered to the name of Helen , -- though nearly as tall and quite as graceful , was robed so simply in muslin that she might have provided an intentional contrast .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 10]: In the man 's esteem she lost nothing thereby .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 36]: He appraised her by the fine contour of her oval face , the wealth of glossy brown hair that clustered under her hat , and the gleam of white teeth between lips of healthy redness .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 21]: Again , had he looked through a woman 's eyes , he would have seen how the difference between Bond-st .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 10]: and Kilburn as shopping centers might be sharply accentuated .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 8]: But that distinction did not trouble him .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 19]: Beneath a cold exterior he had an artist 's soul , and `` Helen '' met an ideal .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 7]: `` Pretty as a peach ! ''
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 13]: he said to himself , and he continued to gaze at her .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 30]: Indeed , for an instant he forgot himself , and it was not until she spoke again that he realized how utterly oblivious were both girls of his nearness .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 18]: `` I suppose everybody who comes here is very rich , '' was her rather awe-stricken comment .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 4]: Her companion laughed .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 11]: `` How nice of you to put it that way !
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 7]: It makes me feel quite important .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 22]: I lunch or dine or sup here often , and the direct inference is that I am rolling in wealth . ''
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 31]: `` Well , dear , you earn a great deal of money -- '' `` I get twenty pounds a week , and this frock I am wearing cost twenty-five .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 14]: Really , Helen , you are the sweetest little goose I ever met .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 11]: You live in London , but are not of it .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 11]: You have n't grasped the first principle of social existence .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 27]: If I dressed within my means , and never spent a sovereign until it was in my purse , I should not even earn the sovereign .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 16]: I simply must mix with this crowd whether I can afford it or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 15]: `` But surely you are paid for your art , not as a mannikin .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 11]: You are almost in the front rank of musical comedy .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 22]: I have seen you occasionally at the theater , and I thought you were the best dancer in the company . ''
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 7]: `` What about my singing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 12]: `` You have a very agreeable and well trained voice . ''
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 8]: `` I 'm afraid you are incorrigible .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 36]: You ought to have said that I sang better than I danced , and the fib would have pleased me immensely ; we women like to hear ourselves praised for accomplishments we do n't possess .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 15]: No , my dear , rule art out of the cast and substitute advertisement .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 16]: Did you notice a dowdy creature who was lunching with two men on your right ?
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 27]: She wore a brown Tussore silk and a turban -- well , she writes the ` Pars About People ' in ` The Daily Journal . '
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 35]: I 'll bet you a pair of gloves that you will see something like this in to-morrow 's paper : ` Lord Archie Beaumanoir entertained a party of friends at the Embankment Hotel yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 25]: At the next table Miss Millicent Jaques , of the Wellington Theater , was lunching with a pretty girl whom I did not know .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 11]: Miss Jaques wore an exquisite , ' etc. , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 16]: Fill in full details of my personal appearance , and you have the complete paragraph .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 53]: The public , the stupid , addle-headed public , fatten on that sort of thing , and it keeps me going far more effectively than my feeble attempts to warble a couple of songs which you could sing far better if only you made up your mind to come on the stage .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 3]: But there !
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 10]: After such unwonted candor I must have a smoke .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 7]: You wo n't try a cigarette ?
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 8]: Well , do n't look so shocked .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 10]: This is n't a church , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 29]: Spencer , who had listened with interest to Miss Jaques 's outspoken views , suddenly awoke to the fact that he was playing the part of an eavesdropper .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 29]: He had all an American 's chivalrous instincts where women were concerned , and his first impulse was to betake himself and his letters to his own room .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 41]: Yet , when all was said and done , he was in a hotel ; the girls were strangers , and likely to remain so ; and it was their own affair if they chose to indulge in unguarded confidences .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 26]: So he compromised with his scruples by pouring out a glass of water , replacing the decanter on its tray with some degree of noise .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 21]: Then he struck an unnecessary match and applied it to his cigar before opening the first of the Denver letters .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 27]: As his glance was momentarily diverted , he did not grasp the essential fact that neither of the pair was disturbed by his well meant efforts .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 52]: Millicent Jaques was lighting a cigarette , and this , to a woman , is an all absorbing achievement , while her friend was so new to her palatial surroundings that she had not the least notion of the existence of another open floor just above the level of her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 34]: `` I do n't know how in the world you manage to exist , '' went on the actress , tilting herself back in her chair to watch the smoke curling lazily upward .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 13]: `` What was it you said the other day when we met ?
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 12]: You are some sort of secretary and amanuensis to a scientist ?
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 5]: Does that mean typewriting ?
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 7]: And what is the science ? ''
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 16]: `` Professor von Eulenberg is a well known man , '' was the quiet reply .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 28]: `` I type his essays and reports , it is true ; but I also assist in his classification work , and it is very interesting . ''
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 7]: `` What does he classify ? ''
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 5]: `` Mostly beetles . ''
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 6]: `` Oh , how horrid !
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 7]: Do you ever see any ? ''
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 4]: `` Thousands . ''
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 7]: `` I should find one enough .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 15]: If it is a fair question , what does your professor pay you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 6]: `` Thirty shillings a week .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 13]: In his own way he is as poor as I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 29]: `` And do you mean to tell me that you can live in those nice rooms you took me to , and dress decently on that sum ? ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 34]: `` I do , as a matter of fact ; but I have a small pension , and I earn a little by writing titbits of scientific gossip for ` The Firefly . '
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 5]: Herr von Eulenberg helps .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 41]: He translates interesting paragraphs from the foreign technical papers , and I jot them down , and by that means I pick up sufficient to buy an extra hat or wrap , and go to a theater or a concert .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 18]: But I have to be careful , as my employer is absent each summer for two months .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 18]: He goes abroad to hunt new specimens , and of course I am not paid then . ''
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 7]: `` Is he away now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 10]: `` And how do you pass your time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 7]: `` I write a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 29]: Some day I hope to get a story accepted by one of the magazines ; but it is so hard for a beginner to find an opening . ''
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 40]: `` Yet when I offered to give you a start in the chorus of the best theater in London , -- a thing , mind you , that thousands of girls are aching for , -- you refused . ''
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 18]: `` I 'm sorry , Millie dear ; but I am not cut out for the stage .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 8]: It does not appeal to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 3]: `` Heigho !
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 3]: Tastes differ .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 13]: Stick to your beetles , then , and marry your professor . ''
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 13]: Helen laughed , with a fresh joyousness that was good to hear .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 22]: `` Herr von Eulenberg is blessed with an exceedingly stout wife and five very healthy children already , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 6]: `` Then that settles it .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 7]: You 're mad , quite mad !
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 7]: Let us talk of something else .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 7]: Do you ever have a holiday ?
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 7]: Where are you going this year ?
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 11]: I 'm off to Champèry when the theater closes . ''
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 12]: `` Champèry , -- in Switzerland , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 40]: `` Ah , that is the dream of my life , -- to see the everlasting snows ; to climb those grand , solemn mountains ; to cross the great passes that one reads of in the travel books .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 9]: Now at last you have made me envious .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 5]: Are you going alone ?
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 9]: But of course that is a foolish question .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 13]: You intend to join others from the theater , no doubt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 10]: `` Well -- er -- something of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 18]: I fear my enthusiasm will not carry me far on the lines that would appeal to you .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 38]: I suppose you consider a short skirt , strong boots , a Tyrolese hat , and an alpenstock to be a sufficient rig-out , whereas my mountaineering costumes will fill five large trunks and three hat boxes .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 22]: I 'm afraid , Helen , we do n't run on the same rails , as our American cousins say . ''
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 6]: There was a little pause .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 30]: Millicent 's words , apparently tossed lightly into the air after a smoke spiral , had in them a touch of bitterness , it might be of self analysis .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 19]: Her guest seemed to take thought before she answered : `` Perhaps the divergence is mainly in environment .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 13]: And I have always inclined to the more serious side of life .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 12]: Even when we were together in Brussels -- '' `` You ?
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 2]: Serious ?
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 5]: At Madam Bérard 's ?
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 4]: I like that .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 16]: Who was it that kicked the plaster off the dormitory wall higher than her head ?
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 11]: Who put pepper in Signor Antonio 's snuff box ? ''
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 13]: Spencer saw the outer waves of a flush on Helen 's cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 26]: `` This is exceedingly interesting , '' he thought ; `` but I can not even persuade myself that I ought to listen any longer .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 18]: Yet , if I rise now and walk away they will know I heard every word . ''
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 22]: Nevertheless , he meant to go , at the risk of their embarrassment ; but he waited for Helen 's reply .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 44]: She laughed , and the ripple of her mirth was as musical as her voice , whereas many women dowered with pleasantly modulated notes for ordinary conversation should be careful never to indulge in laughter , which is less controllable and therefore natural .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 14]: `` That is the worst of having a past , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 18]: `` Let me put it , then , that entomology as a pursuit sternly represses frivolousness . ''
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 7]: `` Does entomology mean beetles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 26]: `` My dear , if you asked Herr von Eulenberg that question he would sate your curiosity with page extracts from one of his books .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 29]: He has written a whole volume to prove that the only true entoma , or insects , are Condylopoda and Hexapoda , which means -- '' `` Cockroaches !
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 3]: Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 28]: To think of Helen Wynton , who once hit a Belgian boy very hard on the nose for being rude , wasting her life on such rubbish !
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 9]: And you actually seem to thrive on it .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 22]: I do believe you are far happier than I. '' `` At present I am envying you that trip to Champèry .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 50]: Why can not some fairy godmother call in at No. 5 , Warburton Gardens , to-night and wave over my awed head a wand that shall scatter sleeping car tickets and banknotes galore , or at any rate sufficient thereof to take me to the Engadine and back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 6]: `` Ah , the Engadine .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 12]: I am not going there this year , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 10]: `` Have n't you planned your tour yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 10]: `` No -- that is , not exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 13]: `` Do you know , that is one of my greatest pleasures .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 17]: With a last year 's Continental Bradshaw and a few tattered Baedekers I journey far afield .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 22]: I know the times , the fares , and the stopping places of all the main routes from Calais and Boulogne .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 27]: I could pass a creditable examination in most of the boat and train services by way of Ostend , Flushing , and the Hook of Holland .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 46]: I assure you , Millie , when my ship does come home , or the glittering lady whom I have invoked deigns to visit my lodgings , I shall call a cab for Charing Cross or Victoria with the assurance of a seasoned traveler . ''
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 14]: For some reason , Miss Jaques refused to share her friend 's enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 11]: `` You are easily pleased , '' she said listlessly .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 30]: `` For my part , after one shuddering glance at the Channel , I try to deaden all sensation till I find myself dressing for dinner at the Ritz .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 11]: I positively refuse to go beyond Paris the first day .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 4]: Ah , bother !
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 10]: Here comes a man whom I wish to avoid .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 19]: Let us be on the move before he sees us , which he can not fail to do .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 11]: Do n't forget that I have a rehearsal at three .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 13]: I have n't , really ; but we must escape somehow . ''
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 32]: Spencer , who had salved his conscience by endeavoring to read a technical letter on mining affairs , would be less than human if he did not lift his eyes then .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 36]: It is odd how the sense of hearing , when left to its unfettered play by the absence of the disturbing influence of facial expression , can discriminate in its analysis of the subtler emotions .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 40]: He was quite sure that Miss Jaques was startled , even annoyed , by the appearance of some person whom she did not expect to meet , and he surveyed the new arrival critically , perhaps with latent hostility .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 22]: He saw a corpulent , well dressed man standing at the foot of the stairs and looking around the spacious room .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 10]: Obviously , he had not come from the restaurant .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 14]: He carried his hat , gloves , and stick in his left hand .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 24]: With his right hand he caressed his chin , and his glance wandered slowly over the little knots of people in the foyer .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 59]: Beyond the fact that a large diamond sparkled on one of his plump fingers , and that his olive tinted face was curiously opposed to the whiteness of the uplifted hand , he differed in no essential from the hundreds of spick and span idlers who might be encountered at that hour in the west end of London .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 17]: He had the physique and bearing of a man athletic in his youth but now over-indulgent .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 21]: An astute tailor had managed to conceal the too rounded curves of the fourth decade by fashioning his garments skillfully .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 15]: His coat fitted like a skin across his shoulders but hung loosely in front .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 32]: The braid of a colored waistcoat was a marvel of suggestion in indicating a waist , and the same adept craftsmanship carried the eye in faultless lines to his verni boots .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 11]: Judged by his profile , he was not ill looking .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 27]: His features were regular , the mouth and chin strong , the forehead slightly rounded , and the nose gave the merest hint of Semitic origin .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 26]: Taken altogether , he had the style of a polished man of the world , and Spencer smiled at the sudden fancy that seized him .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 16]: `` I am attending the first act of a little play , '' he thought .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 18]: `` Helen and Millicent rise and move to center of stage ; enter the conventional villain . ''
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 16]: Miss Jaques was not mistaken when she said that her acquaintance would surely see her .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 18]: She and Helen Wynton had not advanced a yard from their corner before the newcomer discovered them .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 16]: He hastened to meet them , with the aspect of one equally surprised and delighted .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 28]: His manners were courtly , and displayed great friendliness ; but Spencer was quick to notice the air of interest with which his gaze rested on Helen .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 30]: It was possible to see now that Millicent 's unexpected friend had large , prominent dark eyes which lent animation and vivacity to a face otherwise heavy and coarse .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 36]: It was impossible to hear all that was said , as the trio stood in the middle of the room and a couple of men passing up the stairs at the moment were talking loudly .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 42]: But Spencer gathered that Millicent was explaining volubly how she and Miss Wynton had `` dropped in here for luncheon by the merest chance , '' and was equally emphatic in the declaration that she was already overdue at the theater .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 11]: The man said something , and glanced again at Helen .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 25]: Evidently , he asked for an introduction , which Miss Jaques gave with an affability that was eloquent of her powers as an actress .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 11]: The unwished for cavalier was not to be shaken off .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 13]: He walked with them up the stairs and crossed the entrance hall .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 32]: Spencer , stuffing his letters into a pocket , strolled that way too , and saw this pirate in a morning coat bear off both girls in a capacious motor car .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 29]: Not to be balked of the dénouement of the little comedy in real life for which he had provided the audience , the American grabbed the hall porter .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 15]: `` Say , '' he said , `` do you know that gentleman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 7]: That is Mr. Mark Bower . ''
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 20]: Spencer beamed on the man as though he had just discovered that Mr. Mark Bower was his dearest friend .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 14]: `` Well , now , if that is n't the queerest thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 5]: `` Is that Mark ?
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 13]: He 's just gone round to the Wellington Theater , I guess .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 8]: How far is it from here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 9]: `` Not a hundred yards , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 8]: Off went Spencer , without his hat .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 22]: He had intended to follow in a cab , but a sprint would be more effective over such a short distance .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 34]: He crossed the Strand without heed to the traffic , turned to the right , and , to use his own phrase , `` butted into a policeman '' at the first corner .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 15]: `` I 'm on the hunt for the Wellington Theater , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 15]: `` You need n't hunt much farther , '' said the constable good humoredly .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 14]: `` There it is , a little way up on the left . ''
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 14]: At that instant Spencer saw Bower raise his hat to the two women .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 15]: They hurried inside the theater , and their escort turned to reënter his motor .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 10]: The American had learned what he wanted to know .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 21]: Miss Jaques had shaken off her presumed admirer , and Miss Wynton had aided and abetted her in the deed .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 7]: `` You do n't say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 9]: he exclaimed , gazing at the building admiringly .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 5]: `` It looks new .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 14]: In fact the whole street has a kind of San Francisco-after-the-fire appearance . ''
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 7]: `` That 's right , sir .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 23]: It 's not so long since some of the worst slums in London were pulled down to make way for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 13]: `` It 's fine ; but I 'm rather stuck on antiquities .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 14]: I 've seen plenty of last year 's palaces on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 13]: Have a drink , will you , when time 's up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 27]: The policeman glanced surreptitiously at the half-crown which Spencer insinuated into his palm , and looked after the donor as he went back to the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 8]: `` Well , I 'm jiggered ! ''
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 5]: he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 39]: `` I 've often heard tell of the way some Americans see London ; but I never came across a chap who rushed up in his bare head and took a squint at any place in that fashion .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 20]: He seemed to have his wits about him too ; but there must be a screw loose somewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 30]: And indeed Charles K. Spencer , had he paused to take stock of his behavior , must have admitted that it was , to say the least , erratic .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 42]: But his imagination was fired ; his sympathies were all a-quiver with the thought that it lay within his power to share with a kin soul some small part of the good fortune that had fallen to his lot of late .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 10]: `` Wants a fairy godmother , does she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 30]: he asked himself , and the quiet humor that gleamed in his face caused more than one passerby to turn and watch him as he strode along the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 19]: `` Well , I guess I 'll play a character not hitherto heard of in the legitimate drama .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 6]: What price the fairy godfather ?
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 10]: I 've a picture of myself in that rôle .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 4]: Oh , my !
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 6]: See me twirl that wand !
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 8]: Helen , you shall climb those rocks .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 8]: But I do n't like your friend .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 9]: I sha 'n' t send you to Champèry .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 11]: No -- Champèry 's off the map for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 16]: CHAPTER II THE FULFILLMENT OF THE WISH Explanations of motive are apt to become tedious .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 16]: They are generally inaccurate too ; for who can reduce a fantasy to a formula ?
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 13]: Nor should they ever be allowed to clip the wings of romance .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 38]: But the painter who bade his subject sit under a sodium light would justly be deemed a lunatic , and any analysis of Spencer 's character drawn from his latest prank would be faulty in the extreme .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 18]: In all London at that moment there was not a more level headed man of his years .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 21]: He was twenty-eight , an expert mining engineer , and the successful pioneer of a new method of hauling ore .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 34]: Even in Western America , `` God 's own country , '' as it is held to be by those who live there , few men `` arrive '' so early in life .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 27]: Some , it is true , amass wealth by lucky speculation before they are fitted by experience to earn the price of a suit of clothes .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 8]: But they are of the freak order .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 22]: They are not to be classed with one who by hard work wrests a fortune out of the grim Colorado granite .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 14]: Spencer had been called on to endure long years of rebuff and scorn .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 20]: Though scoffed at by many who thought he was wrong , he persisted because he knew he was right .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 12]: Ofttimes Fate will test such a man almost to breaking point .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 37]: Then she yields , and , being feminine , her obduracy is the measure of her favors , for she will bestow on her dogged suitor all , and more than all , that he desired .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 30]: The draft from Leadville , crammed so carelessly into a pocket when he followed the three to the door , was a fair instance of this trick of hers .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 69]: A tunnel , projected and constructed in the teeth of ridicule and financial opposition , had linked up the underground workings of several mines , and proved conclusively that it was far cheaper to bring minerals to the rail in that manner than to sink expensive shafts , raise the ore to the top of a mountain , and cart it to its old level in the valley .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 15]: Once the thing was indisputable , the young engineer found himself rich and famous .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 40]: To increase the feeders of the main bore , he drove another short gallery through a mining claim acquired for a few dollars , -- a claim deemed worthless owing to a geological fault that traversed its whole length .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 6]: That was Fate 's opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 20]: Doubtless she smiled mischievously when she gave him a vein of rich quartz through which to quarry his way .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 33]: The mere delving of the rock had produced two thousand dollars ' worth of ore , of which sum he took a moiety by agreement with the company that purchased his rights .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 62]: People in Leadville soon discovered that Spencer was a bright man , -- `` yes , sir , a citizen of whom the chief mining city of the Rocky Mountains has every reason to be proud , '' -- and the railway magnate who had nearly ruined him by years of hostility buried the past grandiloquently with a _ mot _ .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 13]: `` Charles K. Spencer ca n't be sidetracked , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 11]: `` That K is n't in his name by accident .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 12]: Look at it , -- a regular buffer of a letter !
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 22]: Tell you what , you may monkey with Charles ; but when you hit the K look out for trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 58]: Whereupon the miners laughed , and said that the president was a mighty smart man too , and Spencer , who knew he was a thief , but was unwilling to quarrel with him for the sake of the company , thought that a six months ' vacation in Europe would make for peace and general content .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 5]: He had no plans .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 10]: He was free to wander whithersoever chance led him .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 20]: Arriving in London from Plymouth late on a Thursday evening , he took a bus-driver 's holiday on Friday .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 56]: Finding a tunnel under the Thames in full progress near the hotel , he sought the resident engineer , spoke to him in the lingua franca of the craft , and spent several dangerous and enjoyable hours in crawling through all manner of uncomfortable passages bored by human worms beneath the bed of the river .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 44]: And this was Saturday , and here he was , at three o'clock in the afternoon , turning over in his mind the best way of sending on an expensive trip abroad a girl who had not the remotest notion of his existence .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 37]: It was a whim , and a harmless one , and he excused it to his practical mind by the reflection that he was entitled to one day of extravagance after seven years of hard labor .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 11]: For his own part , he was weary of mountains .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 30]: He had wrought against one , frowning and stubborn as any Alp , and had not desisted until he reached its very heart with a four thousand foot lance .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 11]: Switzerland was the last place in Europe he would visit .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 22]: He wanted to see old cities and dim cathedrals , to lounge in pleasant lands where rivers murmured past lush meadows .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 26]: Though an American born and bred , there was a tradition in his home that the Spencers were once people of note on the border .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 21]: When tired of London , he meant to go north , and ramble through Liddesdale in search of family records .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 26]: But the business presently on hand was to arrange that Swiss excursion for `` Helen , '' and he set about it with characteristic energy .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 19]: In the first instance , he noted her name and address on the back of the Leadville envelop .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 6]: Then he sought the manager .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 23]: `` I guess you know Switzerland pretty well , '' he said , when a polite man was produced by a boy .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 6]: The assumption was well founded .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 47]: In fact , the first really important looking object the manager remembered seeing in this world was the giant Matterhorn , because his mother told him that if he was a bad boy he would be carried off by the demons that dwelt on its summit .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 11]: `` What sort of places are Evian-les-Bains and Champèry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 4]: went on Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 8]: `` Evian is a fashionable lakeside town .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 8]: Champèry is in the hills behind it .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 17]: When Evian becomes too hot in August , one goes to Champèry to cool down . ''
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 9]: `` Are they anywhere near the Engadine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 6]: `` Good gracious , no !
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 10]: They are as different as chalk and cheese . ''
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 7]: `` Is the Engadine the cheese ?
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 7]: Does it take the biscuit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 4]: The manager laughed .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 12]: Like all Londoners , he regarded every American as a humorist .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 9]: `` It all depends , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 49]: `` For my part , I think the Upper Engadine is far and away the most charming section of Switzerland ; but there are ladies of my acquaintance who would unhesitatingly vote for Evian , and for a score of other places where there are promenades and casinos .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 10]: Are you thinking of making a tour there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 20]: `` There 's no telling where I may bring up when I cross the Channel , '' said Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 31]: `` I have heard some talk of the two districts , and it occurred to me that you were just the man to give me a few useful pointers . ''
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 34]: `` Well , the average tourist rushes from one valley to another , tramps over a pass each morning , and spends the afternoon in a train or on board a lake steamer .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 69]: But if I wanted a real rest , and wished at the same time to be in a center from which pleasant walks , or stiff climbs for that matter , could be obtained , I should go by the Engadine Express to St. Moritz , and drive from there to the Maloja-Kulm , where there is an excellent hotel and usually a number of nice people . ''
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 4]: `` English ? ''
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 7]: `` Yes , English and Americans .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 12]: They select the best as a rule , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 9]: `` It sounds attractive , '' said Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 8]: `` And it is , believe me .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 8]: Do n't forget the name , Maloja-Kulm .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 17]: It is twelve miles from everywhere , and practically consists of the one big hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 15]: Spencer procured his hat , gloves , and stick , and called a cab .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 14]: `` Take me to ` The Firefly ' office , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 12]: `` Beg pawdon , sir , but where 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 4]: asked the driver .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 11]: `` It 's up to you to find out . ''
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 12]: `` Then w ` at is it , guv ` nor ?
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 33]: I 've heerd of the ` Orse an ' ` Ound , the Chicken 's Friend , the Cat , an ' the Bee ; but the Firefly leaves me thinkin ' .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 6]: Is it a noospaper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 7]: `` Something of the sort . ''
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 6]: `` All right , sir .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 3]: Jump in .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 9]: We 'll soon be on its track . ''
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 7]: The hansom scampered off to Fleet-st .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 33]: As the result of inquiries Spencer was deposited at the entrance to a dingy court , the depths of which , he was assured , were illumined by `` The Firefly . ''
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 25]: There is nothing that so mystifies the citizen of the New World as the hole-and-corner aspect of some of the business establishments of London .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 30]: He soon learns , however , to differentiate between the spidery dens where money is amassed and the soot laden tenements in which the struggle for existence is keen .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 29]: A comprehensive glance at the exterior of the premises occupied by `` The Firefly '' at once explained to Spencer why the cabman did not know its whereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 26]: Three small rooms sufficed for its literary and commercial staff , and `` To let '' notices stared from several windows in the same building .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 48]: `` Appearances are deceptive ever , '' murmured he , as he scanned the legends on three doors in a narrow lobby ; `` but I think I 'm beginning to catch on to the limited extent of Miss Helen 's earnings from her scientific paragraphs . ''
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 11]: He knocked at each door ; but received no answer .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 17]: Then , having sharp ears , he tried the handle of one marked `` Private . ''
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 29]: It yielded , and he entered , to be accosted angrily by a pallid , elderly , bewhiskered man , standing in front of a much littered table .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 7]: `` Confound it , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 14]: came the growl , `` do n't you know it is Saturday afternoon ?
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 11]: And what do you mean by coming in unannounced ? ''
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 8]: `` Guess you 're the editor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 3]: said Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 7]: `` What if I am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 15]: `` I 've just happened along to have a few quiet words with you .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 30]: If there 's no callers Saturdays , why , that 's exactly what I want , and I came right in because you did n't answer my knock . ''
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 13]: `` I tell you I 'm not supposed to be here . ''
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 16]: `` Then you should n't draw corks while anybody is damaging the paint outside . ''
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 14]: Spencer smiled so agreeably that the editor of `` The Firefly '' softened .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 24]: At first , he had taken his visitor for an unpaid contributor ; but the American accent banished this phantom of the imagination .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 15]: He continued to pour into a tumbler the contents of a bottle of beer .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 32]: `` Well , '' he said , `` now that you are here , what can I do for you , Mr. -- '' `` Spencer -- Charles K. Spencer . ''
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 27]: Instantly it struck the younger man that little more than an hour had elapsed since he gave his name to the letter clerk in the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 15]: The singularity of his proceedings during that hour was thereby brought home to him .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 24]: He knew nothing of newspapers , daily or weekly ; but commonsense suggested that `` The Firefly 's '' radiance was not over-powering .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 27]: His native shrewdness advised caution , though he felt sure that he could , in homely phrase , twist this faded journalist round his little finger .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 22]: `` Before I open the ball , '' he said , `` may I see a copy of your magazine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 10]: Meanwhile the other was trying to sum him up .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 35]: He came to the conclusion that his visitor meant to introduce some new advertising scheme , and , as `` The Firefly '' was sorely in need of advertisements , he decided to listen .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 20]: `` Here is last week 's issue , '' he said , handing to Spencer a small sixteen-page publication .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 14]: The American glanced through it rapidly , while the editor sampled the beer .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 49]: `` I see , '' said Spencer , after he had found a column signed `` H. W. , '' which consisted of paragraphs translated from a German article on airships , -- `` I see that ` The Firefly ' scintillates around the Tree of Knowledge . ''
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 7]: The editor relaxed sufficiently to smile .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 15]: `` That is a good description of its weekly flights , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 9]: `` You do n't use many cuts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 3]: `` N-no .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 15]: They are expensive and hard to obtain for such subjects as we favor . ''
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 32]: `` Do n't you think it would be a good notion to brighten it up a bit -- put in something lively , and more in keeping with the name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 23]: `` I have no opening for new matter , if that is what you mean , '' and the editor stiffened again .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 15]: `` But you have the say-so as to the contents , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 7]: The selection rests with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 3]: `` Good .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 16]: I 'm sort of interested in a young lady , Miss Helen Wynton by name .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 13]: She lives in Warburton Gardens , and does work for you occasionally .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 24]: Now , I propose to send her on a month 's trip to Switzerland , where she will represent ` The Firefly . '
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 41]: You must get her to turn out a couple of pages of readable stuff each week , which you will have illustrated by a smart artist at a cost of say , twenty pounds an article for drawings and blocks .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 19]: I pay all expenses , she gets the trip , and you secure some good copy for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 6]: Is it a deal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 13]: The editor sat down suddenly and combed his whiskers with nervous fingers .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 18]: He was a weak man , and a too liberal beer diet was not good for him .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 10]: `` Are you in earnest , Mr. Spencer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 7]: he queried in a bewildered way .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 5]: `` Dead in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 23]: You write the necessary letter to Miss Wynton while I am here , and I hand you the first twenty in notes .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 28]: You are to tell her to call Monday noon at any bank you may select , and she will be given her tickets and a hundred pounds .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 20]: When I am certain that she has started I undertake to pay you a further sum of sixty pounds .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 6]: I make only two conditions .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 28]: You must guarantee to star her work , as it should help her some , and my identity must not be disclosed to her under any circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 18]: In a word , she must regard herself as the accredited correspondent of ` The Firefly . '
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 40]: If she appears to be a trifle rattled by your generosity in the matter of terms , you must try and look as if you did that sort of thing occasionally and would like to do it often . ''
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 10]: The editor pushed his chair away from the table .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 7]: He seemed to require more air .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 15]: `` Again I must ask you if you actually mean what you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 3]: he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 15]: Spencer opened a pocketbook and counted four five-pound notes out of a goodly bundle .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 20]: `` It is all here in neat copperplate , '' he said , placing the notes on the table .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 30]: `` Maybe you have n't caught on to the root idea of the proposition , '' he continued , seeing that the other man was staring at him blankly .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 12]: `` I want Miss Wynton to have a real good time .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 15]: I also want to lift her up a few rungs of the journalistic ladder .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 21]: But she is sensitive , and would resent patronage ; so I must not figure in the affair at all .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 12]: I have no other motive at the back of my head .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 12]: I 'm putting up two hundred pounds out of sheer philanthropy .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 5]: Will you help ? ''
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 18]: `` There are points about this amazing proposal that require elucidation , '' said the editor slowly .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 33]: `` Travel articles might possibly come within the scope of ` The Firefly ' ; but I am aware that Miss Wynton is what might be termed an exceedingly attractive young lady .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 13]: For instance , you would n't be philanthropic on my account . ''
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 6]: `` You never can tell .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 10]: It all depends how your case appealed to me .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 48]: But if you are hinting that I intend to use my scheme for the purpose of winning Miss Wynton 's favorable regard , I must say that she strikes me as the kind of girl who would think she had been swindled if she learned the truth .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 24]: In any event , I may never see her again , and it is certainly not my design to follow her to Switzerland .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 8]: I do n't kick at your questions .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 16]: You 're old enough to be her father , and mine , for that matter .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 3]: Go ahead .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 16]: This is Saturday afternoon , you know , and there 's no business stirring . ''
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 15]: Spencer had to cover the ground a second time before everything was made clear .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 8]: At last the fateful letter was written .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 13]: He promised to call on Monday and learn how the project fared .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 54]: Then he relieved the cabman 's anxiety , as the alley possessed a second exit , and was driven to the Wellington Theater , where he secured a stall for that night 's performance of the Chinese musical comedy in which Miss Millicent Jaques played the part of a British Admiral 's daughter .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 36]: While Spencer was watching Helen 's hostess cutting capers in a Mandarin 's palace , Helen herself was reading , over and over again , a most wonderful letter that had fallen from her sky .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 10]: It had all the appearance of any ordinary missive .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 46]: The King 's face on a penny stamp , or so much of it as was left uninjured by a postal smudge , looked familiar enough , and both envelop and paper resembled those which had brought her other communications from `` The Firefly . ''
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 9]: But the text was magic , rank necromancy .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 34]: No wizard who ever dealt in black letter treatises could have devised a more convincing proof of his occult powers than this straightforward offer made by the editor of `` The Firefly . ''
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 47]: Four articles of five thousand words each , -- tickets and 100 pounds awaiting her at a bank , -- go to the Maloja-Kulm Hotel ; leave London at the earliest possible date ; please send photographs and suggestions for black-and-white illustrations of mountaineering and society !
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 6]: What could it possibly mean ?
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 19]: At the third reading Helen began to convince herself that this rare stroke of luck was really hers .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 14]: The concluding paragraph shed light on `` The Firefly 's '' extraordinary outburst .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 31]: `` As this commission heralds a new departure for the paper , I have to ask you to be good enough not to make known the object of your journey .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 24]: In fact , it will be as well if you do not state your whereabouts to any persons other than your near relatives .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 30]: Of course , all need for secrecy ceases with the appearance of your first article ; but by that time you will practically be on your way home again .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 14]: I am anxious to impress on you the importance of this instruction . ''
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 8]: Helen found herein the germ of understanding .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 32]: `` The Firefly '' meant to boom itself on its Swiss correspondence ; but even that darksome piece of journalistic enterprise did not explain the princely munificence of the hundred pounds .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 35]: At last , when she calmed down sufficiently to be capable of connected thought , she saw that `` mountaineering '' implied the hire of guides , and that `` society '' meant frocks .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 29]: Of course it was intended that she should spend the whole of the money , and thus give `` The Firefly '' a fair return for its outlay .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 37]: And a rapid calculation revealed the dazzling fact that after setting aside the fabulous sum of two pounds a day for expenses she still had forty pounds left wherewith to replenish her scanty stock of dresses .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 51]: Believing that at any instant the letter might dissolve into a curt request to keep her scientific jottings strictly within the limits of a column , Helen sat with it lying open on her lap , and searched the pages of a tattered guidebook for particulars of the Upper Engadine .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 15]: She had read every line before ; but the words now seemed to live .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 22]: St. Moritz , Pontresina , Sils-Maria , Silvaplana , -- they ceased to be mere names , -- they became actualities .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 90]: The Julier Pass , the Septimer , the Forno Glacier , the Diavolezza Route , and the rest of the stately panorama of snow capped peaks , blue lakes , and narrow valleys , -- valleys which began with picturesque chalets , dun colored cattle , and herb laden pastures , and ended in the yawning mouths of ice rivers whence issued the milky white streams that dashed through the lower gorges , -- they passed before her eyes as she read till she was dazzled by their glories .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 17]: What a day dream to one who dwelt in smoky London year in and year out !
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 8]: What an experience to look forward to !
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 5]: What memories to treasure !
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 14]: Nor was she blind to the effect of the undertaking on her future .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 37]: Though `` The Firefly '' was not an important paper , though its editor was of a half-forgotten day and generation , she would now have good work to show when asked what she had done .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 7]: She was not enamored of beetles .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 34]: Even the classifying of them was monotonous , and she had striven bravely to push her way through the throng of would-be writers that besieged the doors of every popular periodical in London .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 6]: It was a heartbreaking struggle .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 23]: The same post that gave her this epoch marking letter had brought back two stories with the stereotyped expression of editorial regret .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 25]: `` Now , '' thought Helen , when her glance fell on the bulky envelops , `` my name will at least become known .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 11]: And editors very much resemble the public they cater for .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 11]: If a writer achieves success , they all want him .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 12]: I have often marveled how any author got his first chance .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 4]: Now I know .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 16]: It comes this way , like a flash of lightning from a summer sky . ''
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 15]: It was only fit and proper that she should magnify her first real commission .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 27]: No veteran soldier ever donned a field marshal 's uniform with the same zest that he displayed when his subaltern 's outfit came from the tailor .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 78]: So Helen glowed with that serious enthusiasm which is the soul of genius , for without it life becomes flat and gray , and she passed many anxious , half-doubting hours until a courteous bank official handed her a packet at the appointed time on Monday , and gave her a receipt to sign , and asked her how she would take her hundred pounds -- did she want it all in notes or some in gold ?
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 27]: She was so unnerved by this sudden confirmation of her good fortune that she stammered confusedly , `` I -- really -- do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 17]: `` Well , it would be rather heavy in gold , '' came the smiling comment .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 21]: `` This money , I understand , is paid to you for some journalistic enterprise that will take you abroad .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 43]: May I suggest that you should carry , say , thirty pounds in notes and ten in gold , and allow me to give you the balance in the form of circular notes , which are payable only under your signature ? ''
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 22]: `` Yes , '' said Helen , rosy red at her own awkwardness , `` that will be very nice . ''
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 30]: The official pushed across the counter some banknotes and sovereigns , and summoned a commissionaire to usher her into the waiting room till he had prepared the circular notes .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 6]: The respite was a blessing .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 10]: It gave Helen time to recover her self possession .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 68]: She opened the packet and found therein coupons for the journey to and from St. Moritz , together with a letter from the sleeping car company , from which she gathered that a berth on the Engadine Express was provisionally reserved in her name for the following Thursday , but any change to a later date must be made forthwith , as the holiday pressure was beginning .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 20]: It was advisable too , she was reminded , that she should secure her return berth before leaving London .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 11]: Each moment the reality of the tour became more patent .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 26]: She might feel herself bewitched ; but pounds sterling and railway tickets were tangible things , and not to be explained away by any fantasy .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 16]: By the time her additional wealth was ready she was better fitted to guard it .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 20]: She hurried away quite unconscious of the admiring eyes that were raised from dockets and ledgers behind the grille .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 15]: She made for the court in which `` The Firefly '' had its abode .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 39]: The squalor of the passage , the poverty stricken aspect of the stairs , -- items which had prepared her on other occasions for the starvation rate of pay offered for her work , -- now passed unheeded .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 8]: This affectation of scanty means was humorous .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 21]: Obviously , some millionaire had secured what the newspapers called `` a controlling interest '' in `` The Firefly . ''
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 35]: She sought Mackenzie , the editor , and he received her with a manifest reluctance to waste his precious time over details that was almost as convincing as the money and vouchers she carried .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 18]: `` Yes , Thursday will suit admirably , '' he said in reply to her breathless questions .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 30]: `` You will reach Maloja on Friday evening , and if you post the first article that day week it will arrive in good time for the next number .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 15]: As for the style and tone , I leave those considerations entirely to you .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 16]: So long as the matter is bright and readable , that is all I want .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 9]: I put my requirements clearly in my letter .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 12]: Follow that , and you can not make any mistake . ''
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 26]: Helen little realized how precise were the instructions given two hours earlier to the editor , the bank clerk , and the sleeping car company .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 15]: Mackenzie 's curt acceptance of her mission brought a wondering cry to her lips .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 16]: `` I am naturally overjoyed at my selection for this work , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 13]: `` May I ask how you came to think of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 18]: `` Oh , it is hard to say how these things are determined , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 40]: `` We liked your crisp way of putting dull facts , I suppose , and thought that a young lady 's impressions of life in an Anglo-Swiss summer community would be fresher and more attractive than a man 's .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 4]: That is all .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 9]: I hope you will enjoy your experiences . ''
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 17]: `` But , please , I want to thank you -- '' `` Not a word !
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 7]: Business is business , you know .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 13]: If a thing is worth doing , it must be done well .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 3]: Good-by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 23]: He flattered himself that he could spend another man 's money with as lordly an air as the youngest journalist on Fleet-st .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 30]: The difficulty was to find the man with the money , and Mackenzie had given much thought during the Sabbath to the potentialities that lay behind Spencer 's whim .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 17]: He was sure the incident would not close with the publication of Miss Wynton 's articles .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 16]: Judiciously handled , her unknown benefactor might prove equally beneficial to `` The Firefly . ''
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 57]: So Helen tripped out into Fleet-st. , and turned her pretty face westward , and looked so eager and happy that it is not surprising if many a man eyed her as she passed , and many a woman sighed to think that another woman could find life in this dreary city such a joyous thing .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 22]: A sharp walk through the Strand and across Trafalgar Square did a good deal toward restoring the poise of her wits .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 18]: For safety , she had pinned the envelop containing her paper money and tickets inside her blouse .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 51]: The mere presence of the solid little parcel reminded her at every movement that she was truly bound for the wonderful Engadine , and , now that the notion was becoming familiar , she was the more astonished that the choice of `` The Firefly '' had fallen on her .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 28]: It was all very well for Mr. Mackenzie to say that the paper would be brightened by a woman 's views on life in the high Alps .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 19]: The poor worn man looked as if such a holiday would have done him a world of good .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 13]: But the certain fact remained that there was no room for error .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 20]: It was she , Helen Wynton , and none other , for whom the gods had contrived this miracle .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 13]: If it had been possible , she would have crossed busy Cockspur-st .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 20]: with a hop , skip , and a jump in order to gain the sleeping car company 's premises .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 6]: She knew the place well .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 48]: Many a time had she looked at the attractive posters in the windows , -- those gorgeous fly sheets that told of winter in summer among the mountains of Switzerland and the Tyrol , and of summer in winter along the sunlit shores of the Côte d'Azur .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 28]: She almost laughed aloud at the thought that possessed her as she waited for a moment on the curb to allow a press of traffic to pass .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 22]: `` If my luck holds till Christmas , I may be sent to Monte Carlo , '' she said to herself .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 5]: `` And why not ?
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 30]: It 's the first step that counts , and ` The Firefly , ' once fairly embarked on a career of wild extravagance , may keep it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 42]: Under the pressure of that further inspiration she refused to wait any longer , but dodged an omnibus , a motor car , and some hansoms , and pushed open the swing doors of the Bureau de la Campagnie des Wagons-Lits .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 18]: She did not notice that the automobile stopped very quickly a few yards higher up the street .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 29]: The occupant , Mark Bower , alighted , looked at her through the window to make sure he was not mistaken , and followed her into the building .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 18]: He addressed some question to an attendant , and heard Helen say : `` Yes , please .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 5]: Thursday will suit admirably .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 9]: I am going straight through to St. Moritz .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 17]: I shall call on Wednesday and let you know what day I wish to return . ''
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 18]: If Bower had intended to speak to her , he seemed to change his mind rather promptly .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 6]: Helen 's back was turned .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 34]: She was watching a clerk writing out a voucher for her berth in the sleeping car , and the office was full of other prospective travelers discussing times and routes with the officials .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 16]: Bower thanked his informant for information which he could have supplied in ampler detail himself .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 23]: Then he went out , and looked again at Helen from the doorway ; but she was wholly unaware of his presence .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 43]: Thus it came about , quite simply and naturally , that Mark Bower met Miss Helen Wynton on the platform of Victoria Station on Thursday morning , and learned that , like himself , she was a passenger by the Engadine Express .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 49]: He took her presence as a matter of course , hoped she would allow him to secure her a comfortable chair on the steamer , told her that the weather report was excellent , and remarked that they might expect a pleasant crossing in the new turbine steamer .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 13]: -LSB- Illustration : `` I am going through to St. Moritz . ''
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 70]: _ Page 38 _ -RSB- Then , having ascertained that she had a corner seat , and that her luggage was registered through to St. Moritz -LRB- Helen having arrived at the station a good hour before the train was due to start -RRB- , he bowed himself away , being far too skilled a stalker of such shy game to thrust his company on her at that stage .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 22]: His attitude was very polite and friendly , and Helen was almost grateful to the chance which had brought him there .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 21]: She was feeling just a trifle lonely in the midst of the gay and chattering throng that crowded the station .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 32]: The presence of one who was not wholly a stranger , of a friend 's friend , of a man whose name was familiar , made the journey look less dreamlike .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 13]: She was glad he had not sought to travel in her carriage .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 29]: That was tactful , and indeed his courtesy and pleasant words during her first brief meeting with him in the Embankment Hotel had conveyed the same favorable impression .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 70]: So when the hour hand of the big clock overhanging the center of the platform pointed to eleven , the long train glided quietly away with its load of pleasure-seekers , and neither Helen nor her new acquaintance could possibly know that their meeting had been witnessed , with a blank amazement that was rapidly transmuted into sheer annoyance , by a young American engineer named Charles K. Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 39]: CHAPTER III WHEREIN TWO PEOPLE BECOME BETTER ACQUAINTED Mackenzie , of course , was aware that Miss Wynton would leave London by the eleven o'clock train on Thursday , and Spencer saw no harm in witnessing her departure .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 17]: He found a good deal of quiet fun in noting her animated expression and businesslike air .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 62]: Her whole-souled enjoyment of novel surroundings was an asset for the outlay of his two hundred pounds , and he had fully and finally excused that piece of extravagance until he caught sight of Bower strolling along the platform with the easy confidence of one who knew exactly whom he would meet and how he would account for his unbidden presence .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 14]: Spencer at once suspected the man 's motives , not without fair cause .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 18]: They were , he thought , as plain to him as they were hidden from the girl .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 34]: Bower counterfeited the genuine surprise on Helen 's face with admirable skill ; but , to the startled onlooker , peering beneath the actor 's mask , his stagy artifice was laid bare .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 15]: And Spencer was quite helpless , a condition that irritated him almost beyond control .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 8]: He had absolutely no grounds for interference .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 16]: He could only glower angrily and in silence at a meeting he could not prevent .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 25]: Conjecture might run riot as to the causes which had given this sinister bend to an idyl , but perforce he must remain dumb .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 56]: From one point of view , it was lucky that Helen 's self appointed `` godfather '' was in a position not to misjudge her ; from another , it would have been better for Spencer 's peace of mind were he left in ignorance of the trap that was apparently being laid for her .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 23]: Perhaps Fate had planned this thing -- having lately smiled on the American , she may have determined to plague him somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 18]: At any rate , in that instant the whole trend of his purpose took a new turn .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 35]: From a general belief that he would never again set eyes on one in whose fortunes he felt a transient interest , his intent swerved to a fixed resolve to protect her from Bower .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 16]: It would have puzzled him to assign a motive for his dislike of the man .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 10]: But the feeling was there , strong and active .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 21]: It even gave him a certain satisfaction to remember that he was hostile to Bower before he had seen him .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 26]: Indeed , he nearly yielded to the momentary impulse that bade him hasten to the booking office and secure a ticket for St. Moritz forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 9]: He dismissed the notion as quixotic and unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 30]: Bower 's attitude in not pressing his company on Miss Wynton at this initial stage of the journey revealed a subtlety that demanded equal restraint on Spencer 's part .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 24]: Helen herself was so far from suspecting the truth that Bower would be compelled to keep up the pretense of a casual rencontre .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 12]: Nevertheless , Spencer 's chivalric nature was stirred to the depths .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 31]: The conversation overheard in the Embankment Hotel had given him a knowledge of the characteristics of two women that would have amazed both of them were they told of it .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 56]: He was able to measure too the exact extent of Bower 's acquaintance with Helen , while he was confident that the relationship between Bower and Millicent Jaques had gone a great deal further than might be inferred from the actress 's curt statement that he was one whom she `` wished to avoid . ''
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 23]: These two extremes could be reconciled only by a most unfavorable estimate of Bower , and that the American conceded without argument .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 46]: Of course , there remained the possibility that Bower was really a traveler that day by idle chance ; but Spencer blew aside this alternative with the first whiff of smoke from the cigar he lit mechanically as soon as the train left the station .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 30]: `` No , '' he said , in grim self communing , `` the skunk found out somehow that she was going abroad , and planned to accompany her .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 21]: I could see it in the smirk on his face as soon as he discovered her whereabouts on the platform .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 38]: If he means to summer at Maloja , I guess my thousand dollars was expended to no good purpose , and the quicker I put up another thousand to pull things straight the happier I shall be .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 40]: And let me tell you , mother , that if I get Helen through this business well and happy , I shall quit fooling round as godfather , or stage uncle , or any other sort of soft-hearted idiot .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 9]: Meanwhile , Bower has jumped my claim . ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 22]: His glance happened to fall on an official with the legend `` Ticket Inspector '' on the collar of his coat .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 22]: He remembered that this man , or some other closely resembling him , had visited the carriage in which Bower traveled .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 28]: `` Say , '' he cried , hailing him on the spur of the moment , `` when does the next train leave for St. Moritz ? ''
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 9]: `` At two-twenty from Charing Cross , sir .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 9]: But the Engadine Express is the best one .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 6]: Did you miss it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 20]: I just blew in here to see a friend off , and the trip kind of appealed to me .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 13]: Did you notice a reserved compartment for a Mr. Mark Bower ? ''
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 10]: `` I know Mr. Bower very well , sir .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 12]: He goes to Paris or Vienna twenty times a year . ''
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 9]: `` To-day he is going to Switzerland . ''
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 11]: `` So he is , to Zurich , I think .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 5]: First single he had .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 12]: But he 's sure to bring up in Vienna or Frankfort .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 13]: I wish I knew half what he knows about foreign money business .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 10]: I should n't be punching tickets here very long .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 5]: Thank you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 18]: Charing Cross at two-twenty ; but you may have difficulty about booking a berth in the sleeper .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 9]: Just now everybody is crossing the Channel . ''
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 18]: `` It looks like that , '' said Spencer , who had obtained the information he wanted .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 25]: Taking a cab , he drove to the sleeping car company 's office , where he asked for a map of the Swiss railways .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 19]: Zurich , as Bower 's destination , puzzled him ; but he did not falter in his purpose .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 19]: `` The man is a rogue , '' he thought , `` or I have never seen one .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 30]: Anyhow , a night in the train does n't cut any ice , and Switzerland can fill the bill for a week as well as London or Scotland . ''
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 29]: He was fortunate in the fact that some person wished to postpone a journey that day , and the accident assured him of comfortable quarters from Calais onward .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 15]: Then he drove to a bank , and to `` The Firefly '' office .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 10]: Mackenzie had just opened his second bottle of beer .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 11]: By this time he regarded Spencer as an amiable lunatic .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 16]: He greeted him now with as much glee as his dreary nature was capable of .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 4]: `` Hello ! ''
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 11]: `` Been to see the last of the lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 4]: `` Not quite .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 14]: I want to take back what I said about not going to Switzerland .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 7]: I 'm following this afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 4]: `` Great Scott !
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 5]: You 're sudden . ''
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 12]: `` I 'm built that way , '' said Spencer dryly .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 10]: `` Here are the sixty pounds I promised you .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 10]: Now I want you to do me a favor .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 32]: Send a messenger to the Wellington Theater with a note for Miss Millicent Jaques , and ask her if she can oblige you with the present address of Miss Helen Wynton .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 6]: Make a pretext of work .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 15]: No matter if she writes to her friend and the inquiry leads to talk .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 15]: You can put up a suitable fairy tale , I have no doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 9]: `` Better still , let my assistant write .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 14]: Then if necessary I can curse him for not minding his own business .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 8]: But what 's in the wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 21]: `` I wish to find out whether or not Miss Jaques knows of this Swiss journey ; that is all .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 15]: If the reply reaches you by one o'clock send it to the Embankment Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 20]: Otherwise , post it to me at the Kursaal , Maloja-Kulm ; but not in an office envelop . ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 10]: `` You 'll come back , Mr. Spencer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 22]: said the editor plaintively , for he had visions of persuading the eccentric American to start a magazine of his own .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 10]: You 'll probably see me again within six days .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 8]: I 'll look in and report progress .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 4]: Good by . ''
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 11]: A messenger caught him as he was leaving the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 17]: Mackenzie had not lost any time , and Miss Jaques happened to be at the theater .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 45]: `` Sorry , '' she wrote , in the artistic script that looks so well in face cream and soap advertisements , `` I ca n't for the life of me remember the number ; but Miss Wynton lives somewhere in Warburton Gardens . ''
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 34]: The signature , `` Millicent Jaques , '' was an elegant thing in itself , carefully thought out and never hurried in execution , no matter how pressed she might be for time .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 21]: Spencer was on the point of scattering the note in little pieces along the Strand ; but he checked himself .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 23]: `` Guess I 'll keep this as a souvenir , '' he said , and it found a place in his pocketbook .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 28]: Helen Wynton , having crossed the Channel many times during her childhood , was no novice amid the bustle and crush on the narrow pier at Dover .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 22]: She had dispensed with all accessories for the journey , except the few articles that could be crammed into a handbag .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 20]: Thus , being independent of porters , she was one of the first to reach the steamer 's gangway .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 13]: As usual , all the most sheltered nooks on board were occupied .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 16]: There seems to be a mysterious type of traveler who inhabits the cross-Channel vessels permanently .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 42]: No matter how speedy may be the movements of a passenger by the boat-train , either at Dover or Calais , the best seats on the upper deck invariably reveal the presence of earlier arrivals by deposits of wraps and packages .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 8]: This phenomenon was not strange to Helen .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 12]: A more baffling circumstance was the altered shape of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 32]: The familiar lines of the paddle steamer were gone , and Helen was wondering where she might best bestow herself and her tiny valise , when she heard Bower 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 39]: `` I took the precaution to telegraph from London to one of the ship 's officers , '' he said , and nodded toward a couple of waterproof rugs which guarded a recess behind the Captain 's cabin .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 9]: `` That is our corner , I expect .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 10]: My friend will be here in a moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 15]: Sure enough , a man in uniform approached and lifted his gold laced cap .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 24]: `` We have a rather crowded ship , Mr. Bower , '' he said ; `` but you will be quite comfortable there .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 15]: I suppose you deemed the weather too fine to need your usual cabin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 10]: I have a companion to-day , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 31]: Helen was a little bewildered by this ; but it was very pleasant to claim undisputed possession of a quiet retreat from which to watch others trying to find chairs .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 18]: And , although Bower had a place reserved by her side , he did not sit down .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 65]: He chatted for a few minutes on such eminently safe topics as the smooth sea , the superiority of turbine engines in the matter of steadiness , the advisability of lunching in the train after leaving Calais , rather than on board the ship , and soon betook himself aft , there to smoke and chat with some acquaintances whom he fell in with .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 17]: Dover Castle was becoming a gray blur on the horizon when he spoke to Helen again .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 30]: `` You look quite comfortable , '' he said pleasantly , `` and it is wise not to risk walking about if you are afraid of being ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 29]: `` I used to cross in bad weather without consequences , '' she answered ; `` but I am older now , and am doubtful of experiments . ''
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 9]: `` You were educated abroad , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 12]: I was three years in Brussels -- three happy years . ''
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 4]: Why qualify them ?
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 18]: All your years are happy , I should imagine , if I may judge by appearances . ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 27]: `` Well , if happiness can be defined as contentment , you are right ; but I have had my sad periods too , Mr. Bower .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 23]: I lost my mother when I was eighteen , and that was a blow under which I have never ceased to wince .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 10]: Fortunately , I had to seek consolation in work .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 11]: Added to good health , it makes for content . ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 7]: `` You are quite a philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 6]: Will you pardon my curiosity ?
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 7]: I too lead the strenuous life .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 12]: Now , I should like to have your definition of work .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 7]: I am not questioning your capacity .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 12]: My wonder is that you should mention it at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 4]: `` But why ?
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 15]: Any man who knows what toil is should not regard women as dolls . ''
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 11]: `` I prefer to look on them as goddesses . ''
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 3]: Helen smiled .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 19]: `` I fear , then , you will deem my pedestal a sorry one , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 33]: `` Perhaps you think , because you met me once in Miss Jaques 's company , and again here , traveling _ de luxe _ , that I am in her set .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 4]: I am not .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 21]: By courtesy I am called a ` secretary ' ; but the title might be shortened into ` typist . '
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 12]: I help Professor von Eulenberg with his -- scientific researches . ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 22]: Though it was on the tip of her tongue to say `` beetles , '' she substituted the more dignified phrase .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 28]: Bower was very nice and kind ; but she felt that `` beetles '' might sound somewhat flippant and lend a too familiar tone to their conversation .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 4]: `` Von Eulenberg ?
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 6]: I have heard of him .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 19]: Quite a distinguished man in his own line ; an authority on -- moths , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 5]: `` Insects generally . ''
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 30]: She blushed and laughed outright , not only at the boomerang effect of her grandiloquent description of the professor 's industry , but at the absurdity of her position .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 31]: Above all else , Helen was candid , and there was no reason why she should not enlighten a comparative stranger who seemed to take a friendly interest in her .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 23]: `` I ought to explain , '' she went on , `` that I am going to the Engadine as a journalist .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 15]: I have had the good fortune to be chosen for a very pleasant task .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 21]: Hence this present grandeur , which , I assure you , is not a usual condition of entomological secretaries . ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 9]: Bower pretended to ward off some unexpected attack .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 20]: `` I have done nothing to deserve a hard word like that , Miss Wynton , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 10]: `` I shall not recover till we reach Calais .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 14]: May I sit beside you while you tell me what it means ? ''
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 6]: She made room for him .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 12]: `` Strictly speaking , it is nonsense , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 3]: `` Excellent .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 13]: That is the better line for women who are young and pretty .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 16]: We jaded men of the world hate to be serious when we leave business behind .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 20]: Now , you would scarce credit what a lively youngster I am when I come abroad for a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 16]: I always kiss my fingers to France at the first sight of her fair face .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 16]: She bubbles like her own champagne , whereas London invariably reminds me of beer . ''
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 13]: `` Do I take it that you prefer gas to froth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 12]: `` You offer me difficult alternatives , yet I accept them .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 55]: Though gas is as dreadful a description of champagne as entomological is of a certain type of secretary , I would venture to point out that it expands , effervesces , soars ever to greater heights ; but beer , froth and all , tends to become flat , stale , and unprofitable . ''
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 11]: `` I assure you my knowledge of both is limited .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 12]: I had never even tasted champagne until the other day . ''
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 12]: `` When you lunched with Millicent at the Embankment Hotel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 5]: `` Well -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 15]: She was at school with me , and we met last week by accident .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 16]: She is making quite a success at the Wellington Theater , is she not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 5]: `` So I hear .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 15]: I am a director of that concern ; but I seldom go there . ''
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 19]: `` How odd that sounds to one who saves up her pennies to attend a favorite play ! ''
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 26]: `` Then you must have my address , and when I am in town you need never want a stall at any theater in London .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 8]: Now , that is no idle promise .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 4]: I mean it .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 18]: Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to think you were enjoying something through my instrumentality . ''
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 7]: `` How exceedingly kind of you !
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 8]: I shall take you at your word .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 6]: What girl would n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 13]: `` I know quite a number who regard me as an ogre .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 18]: I am not a lady 's man in the general sense of the term , Miss Wynton .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 24]: I might tell you more about myself if it were not for signs that the next five minutes will bring us to Calais .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 33]: You are far too independent , I suppose , that I should offer to carry your bag ; but will you allow me to reserve a joint table for _ déjeuner _ ?
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 29]: There will be a rush for the first service , which is the best , as a rule , and I have friends at court on this line .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 10]: Please do n't say you are not hungry . ''
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 14]: `` That would be impolite , and horribly untrue , '' laughed Helen .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 10]: He took the implied permission , and hurried away .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 15]: They did not meet again until he came to her carriage in the train .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 8]: `` Is this where you are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 12]: he cried , looking up at her through the open window .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 14]: `` I am in the next block , as they say in America .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 13]: When you are ready I shall take you to the dining car .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 6]: Come out on the platform .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 6]: The corridors are simply impassable .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 18]: And here are baskets of peaches , and ripe pears , and all manner of pleasant fruits .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 13]: Yes , try the corridor to the right , and charge resolutely .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 15]: If you inflict the maximum injury on others , you seldom damage yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 46]: In a word , Mark Bower spoke as lightheartedly as he professed to feel , and Helen had no cause whatever to be other than thankful for the chance that brought him to Switzerland on the same day and in the same train as herself .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 13]: His delicate consideration for her well being was manifested in many ways .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 38]: That such a man , whom she knew to be a figure of importance in the financial world , should take an interest in the simple chronicles of her past life was a flattering thing in itself .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 16]: He listened sympathetically to the story of her struggles since the death of her mother .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 40]: The consequent stoppage of the annuity paid to the widow of an Indian civilian rendered it necessary that Helen should supplement by her own efforts the fifty pounds a year allotted to her `` until death or marriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 46]: `` There are plenty of country districts where I could exist quite easily on such a sum , '' she said ; `` but I declined to be buried alive in that fashion , and I made up my mind to earn my own living .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 12]: Somehow , London appeals to young people situated as I was .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 19]: It is there that the great prizes are to be gained ; so I came to London . ''
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 19]: `` From -- '' broke in Bower , who was peeling one of the peaches bought at Calais .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 11]: `` From a village near Sheringham , in Norfolk . ''
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 22]: He nodded with smiling comprehension when she detailed her struggles with editors who could detect no originality in her literary work .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 13]: `` But that phase has passed now , '' he said encouragingly .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 8]: `` Well , it looks like it .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 13]: I hope so ; for I am tired of classifying beetles . ''
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 9]: There -- the word was out at last .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 29]: Perhaps Bower wondered why she laughed and blushed at the recollection of her earlier determination to suppress von Eulenberg 's `` specimens '' as a topic of conversation .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 16]: Already the stiffness of their talk on board the steamship seemed to have vanished completely .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 31]: It was really a pleasant way of passing the time to sit and chat in this glass palace while the train skimmed over a dull land of marshes and poplars .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 18]: `` Beetles , though apt to be flighty , are otherwise dull creatures , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 15]: `` May I ask what paper you are representing on your present tour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 16]: It was an obvious and harmless question ; but Helen was loyal to her bond .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 21]: `` It sounds absurd to have to say it , but I am pledged to secrecy , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 4]: `` Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 24]: Do n't tell me you intend to interview anarchists , or runaway queens , or the other disgruntled people who live in Switzerland .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 19]: Moreover , they usually find quarters in Geneva , while you presumably are bound for the Engadine . ''
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 5]: `` Oh , no .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 8]: My work lies in less excitable circles .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 14]: ` Life in a Swiss hotel ' would be nearer the mark . ''
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 27]: `` Apart from the unusual surroundings , you will find it suspiciously like life in a quiet Norfolk village , Miss Wynton , '' said Bower .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 12]: He paused , tasted the peach , and made a grimace .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 4]: `` Sour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 3]: he protested .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 25]: `` Really , when all is said and done , the only place in which one can buy a decent peach is London . ''
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 10]: `` Ah , a distinct score for Britain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 9]: `` And a fair hit to your credit .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 23]: Let me urge in self defense that if life in France bubbles , it occasionally leaves a bitter taste in the mouth .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 23]: Now you shall go and read , and sleep a little perhaps , if that is not a heretical thing to suggest .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 12]: We have the same table for afternoon tea and dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 9]: Helen had never met such a versatile man .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 13]: He talked of most things with knowledge and restraint and some humor .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 39]: She could not help admitting that the journey would have been exceedingly dull without his companionship , and he had the tact to make her feel that he was equally indebted to her for passing the long hours .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 19]: At dinner she noticed that they were served with dishes not supplied to others in the dining car .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 19]: `` I hope you have not been ordering a dreadfully expensive meal , '' she ventured to say .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 19]: `` I must pay my share , you know , and I am quite an economical person . ''
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 3]: he vowed .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 11]: `` That is the first unkind word you have uttered .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 10]: Surely you will not refuse to be my guest ?
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 31]: Indeed , I was hoping that to-day marked the beginning of a new era , wherein we might meet at times and criticize humanity to our hearts ' content . ''
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 15]: `` I should feel unhappy if I did not pay , '' she insisted .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 13]: `` Well , then , I shall charge you table d'hôte prices .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 6]: Will that content you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 32]: So , when the attendant came to the other tables , Helen produced her purse , and Bower solemnly accepted her few francs ; but no bill was presented to him .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 26]: `` You see , '' he said , smiling at her through a glass of golden wine , `` you have missed a great opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 22]: Not one woman in a million can say that she has dined at the railway company 's expense in France . ''
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 4]: She was puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 11]: His manner had become slightly more confidential during the meal .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 12]: It needed no feminine intuition to realize that he admired her .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 31]: Excitement , the sea air , the heated atmosphere , and unceasing onrush of the train , had flushed her cheeks and lent a deeper shade to her brown eyes .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 22]: She knew that Bower 's was not the only glance that dwelt on her with a curious and somewhat unnerving appraisement .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 13]: Other men , and not a few women , stared at her .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 50]: The mirror in her dressing room had told her that she was looking her best , and her heart fluttered a little at the thought that she had succeeded , without effort , in winning the appreciation of a man highly placed in the world of fashion and finance .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 9]: The conceit induced an odd feeling of embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 15]: To dispel it she took up his words in a vein of playful sarcasm .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 31]: `` If you assure me that for some unexplained reason the railway authorities are giving us this excellent dinner for nothing , please return my money , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 23]: `` The gifts of the gods , and eke of railway companies , must be taken without question , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 11]: `` No , I shall keep your pieces of silver .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 6]: I mean to invest them .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 22]: It will amuse me to learn how much I can make on an initial capital of twelve francs , fifty centimes .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 5]: Will you allow that ?
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 14]: I shall be scrupulously accurate , and submit an audited account at Christmas .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 11]: Even my worst enemies have never alleged dishonesty against me .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 6]: Is it a bargain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 14]: `` Y-yes , '' she stammered confusedly , hardly knowing what he meant .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 13]: He was leaning over the small table and looking steadfastly at her .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 13]: She noticed that the wine and food had made his skin greasy .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 27]: It suddenly occurred to her that Mark Bower resembled certain exotic plants which must be viewed from a distance if they would gratify the critical senses .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 9]: The gloss of a careful toilet was gone .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 24]: He was altogether cruder , coarser , more animal , since he had eaten , though his consumption of wine was quite moderate .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 15]: His big , rather fierce eyes were more than prominent now ; they bulged .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 10]: Certain Jewish characteristics in his face had become accentuated .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 28]: She remembered the ancient habit of anointing with oil , and laughed at the thought , for that was a little trick of hers to conceal nervousness .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 8]: `` You doubt me , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 4]: he half whispered .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 32]: `` Or do you deem it beyond the power of finance to convert so small a sum into hundreds -- it may be thousands -- of pounds in six months ? ''
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 52]: `` Indeed I should credit you with ability to do that and more , Mr. Bower , '' she said ; `` but I was wondering why you made such an offer to a mere acquaintance , -- one whom it is more than likely you will never meet again . ''
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 12]: The phrase had a harsh and awkward sound in her ears .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 11]: Bower , to her relief , seemed to ignore it .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 16]: `` It is permissible to gratify an impulse once in awhile , '' he countered .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 25]: `` And not to mention the audited accounts , there was a matter of theater tickets that should serve to bring us together again .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 15]: Wo n't you give me your address , in London if not in Switzerland ?
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 5]: Here is mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 11]: He produced a pocketbook , and picked out a card .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 8]: It bore his name and his club .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 12]: He added , in pencil , `` 50 Hamilton Place . ''
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 22]: `` Letters sent to my house reach me , no matter where I may happen to be , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 8]: The incident brought fresh tremors to Helen .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 49]: Indeed , the penciled address came as an unpleasant shock ; for Millicent Jaques , on the day they met in Piccadilly , having gone home with Helen to tea , excused an early departure on the ground that she was due to dinner at that very house .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 29]: But she took the card , and strove desperately to appear at ease , for she had no cause to quarrel with one whose manners were so courteous .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 10]: `` Thank you very much , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 21]: `` If you care to see my articles in the -- in the paper , I shall send you copies .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 7]: Now I must say good by .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 5]: I am rather tired .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 17]: Before I go let me say how deeply indebted I feel for your kindness to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 3]: She rose .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 11]: Bower stood up too , and bowed with smiling deference .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 8]: `` Good night , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 14]: `` You will not be disturbed by the customs people at the frontier .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 7]: I have arranged all that . ''
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 30]: Helen made the best of her way along the swaying corridors till she reached her section of the sleeping car ; but Bower resumed his seat at the table .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 15]: He ordered a glass of fine champagne and held it up to the light .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 27]: There was a decided frown on his strong face , and the attendant who served him imagined that there was something wrong with the liqueur . ''
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 11]: _ N'est - ce pas bon , m ` sieur ?
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 5]: _ '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 9]: `` Will you go to the devil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 12]: said Bower , speaking very slowly without looking at him . ''
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 18]: _ Oui , m ` sieur , Je vous assure _ , '' and the man disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 15]: It was not the wine , but the woman , that was perplexing him .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 11]: Not often had the lure of gold failed so signally .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 12]: And why was she so manifestly startled at the last moment ?
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 6]: Had he gone too far ?
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 20]: Was he mistaken in the assumption that Millicent Jaques had said little or nothing concerning him to her friend ?
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 13]: And this commission too , -- there were inexplicable features about it .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 37]: He knew a great deal of the ways of newspapers , daily and weekly , and it was not the journalistic habit to send inexperienced young women on costly journeys to write up Swiss summer resorts .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 27]: He frowned still more deeply as he thought of the Maloja-Kulm Hotel , for Helen had innocently affixed a label bearing her address on her handbag .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 20]: He peopled it with dozens of smart young men and not a few older beaux of his own type .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 10]: His features relaxed somewhat when he remembered the women .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 12]: Helen was alone , and far too good-looking to command sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 11]: There should be the elements of trouble in that quarter .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 36]: If he played his cards well , and he had no reason to doubt his skill , Helen should greet him as her best friend when he surprised her by appearing unexpectedly at the Maloja-Kulm .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 5]: Then he waxed critical .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 21]: She was young , and lively , and unquestionably pretty ; but was she worth all this planning and contriving ?
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 24]: She was by way of being a prude too , and held serious notions of women 's place in the scheme of things .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 33]: At any rate , the day 's hunting had not brought him far out of his path , Frankfort being his real objective , and he would make up his mind later .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 73]: Perhaps she would remove all obstacles by writing to him on her return to London ; but the recollection of her frank , clear gaze , of lips that were molded for strength as well as sweetness , of the dignity and grace with which the well shaped head was poised on a white firm neck , warned him that such a woman might surrender to love , but never to greed .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 32]: Then he laughed , and ordered another liqueur , and drank a toast to to-morrow , when all things come to pass for the man who knows how to contrive to-day .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 29]: In the early morning , at Basle , he awoke , and was somewhat angry with himself when he found that his thoughts still dwelt on Helen Wynton .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 32]: In the cold gray glimmer of dawn , and after the unpleasant shaking his pampered body had received all night , some of the romance of this latest quest had evaporated .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 21]: He was stiff and weary , and he regretted the whim that had led him a good twelve hours astray .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 9]: But he roused himself and dressed with care .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 47]: Some twenty minutes short of Zurich he sent an attendant to Miss Wynton 's berth to inquire if she would join him for early coffee at that station , there being a wait of a quarter of an hour before the train went on to Coire .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 14]: Helen , who was up and dressed , said she would be delighted .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 34]: She too had been thinking , and , being a healthy-minded and kind-hearted girl , had come to the conclusion that her abrupt departure the previous night was wholly uncalled for and ungracious .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 18]: So it was with a smiling face that she awaited Bower on the steps of her carriage .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 54]: She shook hands with him cordially , did not object in the least degree when he seized her arm to pilot her through a noisy crowd of foreigners , and laughed with utmost cheerfulness when they both failed to drink some extraordinarily hot coffee served in glasses that seemed to be hotter still .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 31]: Helen had the rare distinction of being quite as bright and pleasing to the eye in the searching light of the sun 's first rays as at any other hour .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 11]: Bower , though spruce and dandified , looked rather worn .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 11]: `` I did not sleep well , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 18]: `` And the rails to the frontier on this line are the worst laid in Europe . ''
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 10]: `` It is early yet , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 13]: `` Why not turn in again when you reach your hotel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 6]: `` Perish the thought ! ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 12]: `` I shall wander disconsolate by the side of the lake .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 9]: Please say you will miss me at breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 17]: And , by the way , you will find a table specially set apart for you .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 8]: I suppose you change at Coire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 8]: `` How kind and thoughtful you are .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 13]: Yes , I am going to the Engadine , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 11]: `` Well , give my greetings to the high Alps .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 10]: I have climbed most of them in my time .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 21]: More improbable things have happened than that I may renew the acquaintance with some of my old friends this year .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 13]: What fun if you and I met on the Matterhorn or Jungfrau !
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 20]: But they are far away from the valley of the inn , and perhaps you do not climb . ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 14]: `` I have never had the opportunity ; but I mean to try .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 10]: Moreover , it is part of my undertaking . ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 13]: `` Then may we soon be tied to the same rope ! ''
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 26]: Thus they parted , with cheery words , and , on Helen 's side , a genuine wish that they might renew a pleasant acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 17]: Bower waited on the platform to see the last of her as the train steamed away .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 24]: `` Yes , it is worth while , '' he muttered , when the white feathers on her hat were no longer visible .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 30]: He did not go to the lake , but to the telegraph office , and there he wrote two long messages , which he revised carefully , and copied .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 14]: Yet he frowned again , even while he was paying for their transmission .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 14]: Never before had he taken such pains to win any woman 's regard .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 18]: And the knowledge vexed him , for the taking of pains was not his way with women .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 50]: CHAPTER IV HOW HELEN CAME TO MALOJA At Coire , or Chur , as the three-tongued Swiss often term it -- German being the language most in vogue in Switzerland -- Helen found a cheerful looking mountain train awaiting the coming of its heavy brother from far off Calais .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 24]: It was soon packed to the doors , for those Alpine valleys hum with life and movement during the closing days of July .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 24]: Even in the first class carriages nearly every seat was filled in a few minutes , while pandemonium reigned in the cheaper sections .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 30]: Helen , having no cumbersome baggage to impede her movements , was swept in on the crest of the earliest wave , and obtained a corner near the corridor .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 71]: She meant to leave her handbag there , stroll up and down the station for a few minutes , mainly to look at the cosmopolitan crowd , and perhaps buy some fruit ; but the babel of English , German , French , and Italian , mixed with scraps of Russian and Czech , that raged round a distracted conductor warned her that the wiser policy was to sit still .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 26]: An Englishwoman , red faced , elderly , and important , was offered a center seat , facing the engine , in Helen 's compartment .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 4]: She refused it .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 5]: Her indignation was magnificent .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 12]: To face the engine , she declared , meant instant illness .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 16]: `` I never return to this wretched country that I do not regret it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 3]: she shrilled .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 6]: `` Have you no telegraphs ?
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 23]: Can not your officials ascertain from Zurich how many English passengers may be expected , and make suitable provision for them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 53]: As this tirade was thrown away on the conductor , she proceeded to translate it into fairly accurate French ; but the man was at his wits ' end to accommodate the throng , and said so , with the breathless politeness that such a _ grande dame _ seemed to merit .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 15]: `` Then you should set apart a special train for passengers from England ! ''
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 4]: she declared vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 10]: `` I shall never come here again -- never !
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 8]: The place is overrun with cheap tourists .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 12]: Moreover , I shall tell all my friends to avoid Switzerland .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 22]: Perhaps , when British patronage is withdrawn from your railways and hotels , you will begin to consider our requirements . ''
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 28]: Helen felt that her irate fellow countrywoman was metaphorically hurling large volumes of the peerage , baronetage , and landed gentry at the unhappy conductor 's head .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 14]: Again he pointed out that there was a seat at madam 's service .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 17]: When the train started he would do his best to secure another in the desired position .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 35]: As the woman , whose proportions were generous , was blocking the gangway , she received a forcible reminder from the end of a heavy portmanteau that she must clear out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 14]: Breathing dire reprisals on the Swiss federal railway system , she entered unwillingly .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 4]: `` Disgraceful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 3]: she snorted .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 6]: `` A nation of boors !
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 14]: In another second I should have been thrown down and trampled on . ''
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 27]: A stolid German and his wife occupied opposite corners , and the man probably wondered why the _ Englischer frau _ glared at him so fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 6]: But he did not move .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 23]: Helen , thinking to throw oil on the troubled waters , said pleasantly , `` Wo n't you change seats with me ?
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 12]: I do n't mind whether I face the engine or not .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 17]: In any case , I intend to stand in the corridor most of the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 19]: The stout woman , hearing herself addressed in English , lifted her mounted eyeglasses and stared at Helen .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 9]: In one sweeping glance she took in details .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 58]: As it happened , the girl had expended fifteen of her forty pounds on a neat tailor made costume , a smart hat , well fitting gloves , and the best pair of walking boots she could buy ; for , having pretty feet , it was a pardonable vanity that she should wish them well shod .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 20]: Apparently , the other was satisfied that there would be no loss of caste in accepting the proffered civility .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 10]: I am very much obliged , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 15]: `` It is awfully sweet of you to incommode yourself for my sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 39]: It was difficult to believe that the woman who had just stormed at the conductor , who had the effrontery to subject Helen to that stony scrutiny before she answered , could adopt such dulcet tones so suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 24]: Helen , frank and generous-minded to a degree , would have preferred a gradual subsidence of wrath to this remarkable _ volte-face _ .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 22]: But she reiterated that she regarded her place in a carriage as of slight consequence , and the change was effected .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 18]: The other adjusted her eyeglasses again , and passed in review the remaining occupants of the compartment .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 12]: They were `` foreigners , '' whose existence might be ignored .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 19]: `` This line grows worse each year , '' she remarked , by way of a conversational opening .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 7]: `` It is horrid traveling alone .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 9]: Unfortunately , I missed my son at Lucerne .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 8]: Are your people on the train ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 6]: I too am alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 6]: Going to St. Moritz ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 13]: `` Yes ; but I take the diligence there for Maloja . ''
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 4]: `` The diligence !
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 7]: Who in the world advised that ?
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 7]: Nobody ever travels that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 66]: By `` nobody , '' she clearly conveyed the idea that she mixed in the sacred circle of `` somebodies , '' carriage folk to the soles of their boots , because Helen 's guidebook showed that a diligence ran twice daily through the Upper Engadine , and the Swiss authorities would not provide those capacious four-horsed vehicles unless there were passengers to fill them .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 3]: cried Helen .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 10]: `` Should I have ordered a carriage beforehand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 4]: `` Most decidedly .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 7]: But your friends will send one .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 10]: They know you are coming by this train ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 3]: Helen smiled .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 30]: She anticipated a certain amount of cross examination at the hands of residents in the hotel ; but she saw no reason why the ordeal should begin so soon .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 12]: `` I must take my luck then , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 13]: `` There ought to be plenty of carriages at St. Moritz . ''
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 16]: Without being positively rude , her new acquaintance could not repeat the question thus shirked .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 9]: But she had other shafts in her quiver .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 12]: `` You will stay at the Kursaal , of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 10]: `` A passing visit , or for a period ?
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 10]: I ask because I am going there myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 6]: `` Oh , how nice !
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 8]: I am glad I have met you .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 13]: I mean to remain at Maloja until the end of August . ''
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 6]: `` Quite the right time .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 9]: The rest of Switzerland is unbearable in August .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 8]: You will find the hotel rather full .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 41]: The Burnham-Joneses are there , -- the tennis players , you know , -- and General and Mrs. Wragg and their family , and the de la Veres , nominally husband and wife , -- a most charming couple individually .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 8]: Have you met the de la Veres ?
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 2]: No ?
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 16]: Well , do n't be unhappy on Edith 's account if Reginald flirts with you .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 5]: She likes it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 13]: `` But perhaps I might not like it , '' laughed Helen .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 10]: `` Ah , Reginald has such fascinating manners ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 23]: A sigh seemed to deplore the days of long ago , when Reginald 's fascination might have displayed itself on her account .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 22]: Again there was a break in the flow of talk , and Helen began to take an interest in the scenery .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 27]: Not to be balked , her inquisitor searched in a _ portmonnaie _ attached to her left wrist with a strap , and produced a card .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 16]: `` We may as well know each other 's names , '' she cooed affably .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 7]: `` Here is my card . ''
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 16]: Helen read , `` Mrs. H. de Courcy Vavasour , Villa Menini , Nice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 38]: `` I am sorry , '' she said , with a friendly smile that might have disarmed prejudice , `` but in the hurry of my departure from London I packed my cards in my registered baggage .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 7]: My name is Helen Wynton . ''
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 7]: The eyeglasses went up once more .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 9]: `` Do you spell it with an I ?
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 9]: Are you one of the Gloucestershire Wintons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 13]: I live in town ; but my home is in Norfolk . ''
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 12]: `` And whose party will you join at the Maloja ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 9]: Helen colored a little under this rigorous heckling .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 19]: `` As I have already told you , Mrs. Vavasour , I am alone , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 16]: `` Indeed , I have come here to -- to do some literary work . ''
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 6]: `` For a newspaper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 7]: Mrs. Vavasour received this statement guardedly .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 35]: If Helen was on the staff of an important journal there was something to be gained by being cited in her articles as one of the important persons `` sojourning '' in the Engadine .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 21]: `` It is really wonderful , '' she admitted , `` how enterprising the great daily papers are nowadays . ''
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 32]: Helen , very new to a world of de Courcy Vavasours , and Wraggs , and Burnham-Joneses , forgave this hawklike pertinacity for sake of the apparent sympathy of her catechist .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 6]: And she was painfully candid .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 32]: `` The weekly paper I represent is not at all well known , '' she explained ; `` but here I am , and I mean to enjoy my visit hugely .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 16]: It is the chance of a lifetime to be sent abroad on such a mission .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 29]: I little dreamed a week since that I should be able to visit this beautiful country under the best conditions without giving a thought to the cost . ''
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 3]: Poor Helen !
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 37]: Had she delved in many volumes to obtain material that would condemn her in the eyes of the tuft hunter she was addressing , she could not have shocked so many conventions in so few words .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 8]: She was poor , unknown , unfriended !
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 11]: Worse than these negative defects , she was positively attractive !
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 43]: Mrs. Vavasour almost shuddered as she thought of the son `` missed '' at Lucerne , the son who would arrive at Maloja on the morrow , in the company of someone whom he preferred to his mother as a fellow traveler .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 7]: What a pitfall she had escaped !
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 11]: She might have made a friend of this impossible person !
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 17]: Nevertheless , rendered wary by many social skirmishes , she did not declare war at once .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 10]: The girl was too outspoken to be an adventuress .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 12]: She must wait , and watch , and furbish her weapons .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 28]: Helen , whose brain was nimble enough to take in some of Mrs. Vavasour 's limitations , hoped that the preliminary inquiry into her caste was ended .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 6]: She went into the corridor .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 32]: A man made room for her with an alacrity that threatened an attempt to draw her into conversation , so she moved somewhat farther away , and gave herself to thought .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 63]: If this prying woman was a fair sample of the people in the hotel , it was obvious that the human element in the high Alps held a suspicious resemblance to society in Bayswater , where each street is a faction and the clique in the `` Terrace '' is not on speaking terms with the clique in the `` Gardens . ''
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 14]: Thus far , she owned to a feeling of disillusionment in many respects .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 30]: Two years earlier , a naturalist in the Highlands had engaged von Eulenberg to classify his collection , and Helen had gone to Inverness with the professor 's family .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 44]: She saw something then of the glories of Scotland , and her memories of the purple hills , the silvery lakes , the joyous burns tumbling headlong through woodland and pasture , were not dimmed by the dusty garishness of the Swiss scenery .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 13]: True , Baedeker said that these pent valleys were suffocating in midsummer .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 15]: She could only await in diminished confidence her first glimpse of the eternal snows .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 15]: And again , the holiday makers were not the blithesome creatures of her imagination .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 29]: Some were reading , many sleeping , and the rest , for the most part , talking in strange tongues of anything but the beauties of the landscape .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 11]: The Britons among them seemed to be brooding on glaciers .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 52]: A party of lively Americans were playing bridge , and a scrap of gossip in English from a neighboring compartment revealed that some woman who went to a dance at Montreux , `` wore a cheap voile , my dear , a last year 's bargain , all crumpled and dirty .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 8]: You never saw such a fright ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 22]: These things were trivial and commonplace ; a wide gap opened between them and Helen 's day dreams of Alpine travel .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 28]: By natural sequence of ideas she began to contrast her present loneliness with yesterday 's pleasant journey , and the outcome was eminently favorable to Mark Bower .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 4]: She missed him .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 25]: She was quite sure , had he accompanied her from Zurich , that he would have charmed away the dull hours with amusing anecdotes .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 33]: Instead of feeling rather tired and sleepy , she would now be listening to his apt expositions of the habits and customs of the places and people seen from the carriage windows .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 14]: For fully five minutes her expressive mouth betrayed a little moue of disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 43]: And then the train climbed a long spiral which gave a series of delightful views of a picturesque Swiss village , -- exactly such a cluster of low roofed houses as she had admired many a time in photographs of Alpine scenery .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 24]: An exclamation from a little boy who clapped his hands in ecstasy caused her to look through a cleft in the nearer hills .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 25]: With a thrill of wonder she discovered there , remote and solitary , all garbed in shining white , a majestic snow capped mountain .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 6]: this was the real Switzerland !
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 14]: Her heart throbbed , and her breath came in fluttering gasps of excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 14]: How mean and trivial were class distinctions in sight of nature 's nobility !
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 12]: She was uplifted , inspirited , filled with a sedate happiness .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 12]: She wanted to voice her gladness as the child had done .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 35]: A high pitched female voice said : `` Of course I had to call , because Jack meets her husband in the city ; but it is an awful bore knowing such people . ''
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 44]: Then the train plunged into a noisome tunnel , and turned a complete circle in the heart of the rock , and when it panted into daylight again the tall square tower of the village church had sunk more deeply into the valley .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 33]: Far beneath , two bright steel ribbons -- swallowed by a cavernous mouth that belched clouds of dense smoke -- showed the strangeness of the route that led to the silent peaks .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 22]: At times the rails crossed or ran by the side of a white , tree lined track that mounted ever upward .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 29]: Though she could not recall the name of the pass , Helen was aware that this was one of the fine mountain roads for which Switzerland is famous .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 13]: Pedestrians , singly or in small parties , were trudging along sturdily .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 42]: They seemed to be mostly German tourists , jolly , well fed folk , nearly as many women as men , each one carrying a rucksack and alpenstock , and evidently determined to cover a set number of kilometers before night .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 19]: `` That is the way in which I should like to see the Alps , '' thought Helen .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 24]: `` I am sure they sing as they walk , and they miss nothing of the grandeur and exquisite coloring of the hills .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 27]: A train is very comfortable ; but it certainly brings to these quiet valleys a great many people who would otherwise never come near them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 20]: The force of this trite reflection was borne in on her by a loud wrangle between the bridge players .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 17]: A woman had revoked , and was quite wroth with the man who detected her mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 22]: At the next stopping place Helen bought some chocolates , and made a friend of the boy , a tiny Parisian .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 19]: The two found amusement in searching for patches of snow on the northerly sides of the nearest hills .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 53]: Once they caught a glimpse of a whole snowy range , and they shrieked so enthusiastically that the woman whose husband was also in the city glanced at them with disapproval , as they interrupted a full and particular if not true account of the quarrel between the Firs and the Limes .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 22]: At last the panting engine gathered speed and rushed along a wide valley into Samaden , Celerina , and St. Moritz .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 38]: Mrs. Vavasour seemed to be absorbed in a Tauchnitz novel till the last moment , and the next sight of her vouchsafed to Helen was her departure from the terminus in solitary state in a pair-horse victoria .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 22]: It savored somewhat of unkindness that she had not offered to share the roomy vehicle with one who had befriended her .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 23]: `` Perhaps she was afraid I might not pay my share of the hire , '' said Helen to herself rather indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 43]: But a civil hotel porter helped her to clear the customs shed rapidly , secured a comfortable carriage , advised her confidentially as to the amount that should be paid , and promised to telephone to the hotel for a suitable room .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 16]: She was surprised to find how many of her fellow passengers were bound for Maloja .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 30]: Some she had encountered at various stages of the journey all the way from London , while many , like Mrs. Vavasour , had joined the train in Switzerland .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 55]: She remembered too , with a quiet humor that had in it a spice of sarcasm , that her elderly acquaintance had not come from England , and had no more right to demand special accommodation at Coire than the dozens of other travelers who put in an appearance at each station after Basle .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 32]: She noticed that as soon as the luggage was handed to the driver to be strapped behind each vehicle , the newcomers nearly all went to a neighboring hotel for luncheon .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 24]: Being a healthy young person , and endowed with a sound digestion , Helen deemed this example too good not to be followed .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 19]: Then she began a two hours ' drive through a valley that almost shook her allegiance to Scotland .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 43]: The driver , a fine looking old man , with massive features and curling gray hair that reminded her of Michelangelo 's head of Moses , knowing the nationality of his fare , resolutely refused to speak any other language than English .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 26]: He would jerk round , flourish his whip , and cry : `` Dissa pless St. Moritz Bad ; datta pless St. Moritz Dorp . ''
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 44]: Soon he announced the `` Engelish kirch , '' thereby meaning the round arched English church overlooking the lake ; or it might be , with a loftier sweep of the whip , `` Piz Julier montin , mit lek Silvaplaner See . ''
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 15]: All this Helen could have told him with equal accuracy and even greater detail .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 16]: Had she not almost learned by heart each line of Baedeker on the Upper Engadine ?
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 26]: Could she not have reproduced from memory a fairly complete map of the valley , with its villages , mountains , and lakes clearly marked ?
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 30]: But she would not on any account repress the man 's enthusiasm , and her eager acceptance of his quaint information induced fresh efforts , with more whip waving .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 4]: `` Piz Corvatsch !
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 6]: Him ver ' big fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 6]: Twelf t ` ousen foots .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 9]: W'en me guide him bruk ze leg . ''
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 19]: She had seen that he was very lame as he hobbled about the carriage tying up her boxes .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 7]: So here was a real guide .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 13]: That explained his romantic aspect , his love of the high places .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 21]: And he had been maimed for life by that magnificent mountain whose scarred slopes were now vividly before her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 11]: The bright sunshine lit lakes and hills with its glory .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 11]: A marvelous atmosphere made all things visible with microscopic fidelity .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 24]: From Campfer to Silvaplana looked to be a ten minutes ' drive , and from Silvaplana to Sils-Maria another quarter of an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 31]: Helen had to consult her watch and force herself to admit that the horses were trotting fully seven miles an hour before she realized that distances could be so deceptive .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 12]: The summit of the lordly Corvatsch seemed to be absurdly near .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 48]: She judged it within the scope of an easy walk between breakfast and afternoon tea from the hotel on a tree covered peninsula that stretched far out into Lake Sils-Maria , and she wondered why anyone should fall and break his leg during such a simple climb .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 57]: Just to make sure , she glanced at the guidebook , and it gave her a shock when she saw the words , `` Guides necessary , '' -- `` Descent to Sils practicable only for experts , '' -- `` Spend night at Roseg Inn , '' -- the route followed being that from Pontresina .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 76]: Then she recollected that the lovely valley she was traversing from beginning to end was itself six thousand feet above sea level , -- that the observatory on rugged old Ben Nevis , which she had visited when in Scotland , was , metaphorically speaking , two thousand feet beneath the smooth road along which she was being driven , and that the highest peak on Corvatsch was still six thousand feet above her head .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 8]: All at once , Helen felt subdued .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 16]: The fancy seized her that the carriage was rumbling over the roof of the world .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 24]: In a word , she was yielding to the exhilaration of high altitudes , and her brain was ready to spin wild fantasies .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 10]: At Sils-Maria she was brought suddenly to earth again .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 55]: It must not be forgotten that her driver was a St. Moritz man , and therefore at constant feud with the men from the Kursaal , who brought empty carriages to St. Moritz , and went back laden with the spoil that would otherwise have fallen to the share of the local livery stables .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 19]: Hence , he made it a point of honor to pass every Maloja owned vehicle on the road .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 37]: Six times he succeeded , but , on the seventh , reversing the moral of Bruce 's spider , he smashed the near hind wheel by attempting to slip between a landau and a stone post .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 23]: Helen was almost thrown into the lake , and , for the life of her , she could not repress a scream .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 39]: But the danger passed as rapidly as it had risen , and all that happened was that the carriage settled down lamely by the side of the road , with its weight resting on one of her boxes .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 7]: The driver spoke no more English .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 14]: He bewailed his misfortune in free and fluent Italian of the Romansch order .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 70]: But he understood German , and when Helen demanded imperatively that he should unharness the horses , and help to prop the carriage off a crumpled tin trunk that contained her best dresses , he recovered his senses , worked willingly , and announced with a weary grin that if the _ gnädische fräulein _ would wait a little half-hour he would obtain another wheel from a neighboring forge .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 28]: Having recovered from her fright she was so touched by the poor fellow 's distress that she promised readily to stand by him until repairs were effected .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 11]: It was a longer job than either of them anticipated .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 24]: The axle was slightly bent , and a blacksmith had to bring clamps and a jackscrew before the new wheel could be adjusted .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 13]: Even then it had an air of uncertainty that rendered speed impossible .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 43]: The concluding five miles of the journey were taken at a snail 's pace , and Helen reflected ruefully that it was possible to `` bruk ze leg '' on the level high road as well as on the rocks of Corvatsch .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 11]: Of course , she received offers of assistance in plenty .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 21]: Every carriage that passed while the blacksmith was at work pulled up and placed a seat therein at her command .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 6]: But she refused them all .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 17]: It was not that she feared to desert her baggage , for Switzerland is proverbially honest .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 32]: The unlucky driver had tried to be friendly ; his fault was due to an excess of zeal ; and each time she declined the proffered help his furrowed face brightened .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 24]: If she did not reach the hotel until midnight she was determined to go there in that vehicle , and in none other .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 13]: The accident threw her late , but only by some two hours .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 20]: Instead of arriving at Maloja in brilliant sunshine , it was damp and chilly when she entered the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 18]: A bank of mist had been carried over the summit of the pass by a southwesterly wind .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 26]: Long before the carriage crawled round the last great bend in the road the glorious panorama of lake and mountains was blotted out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 41]: The horses seemed to be jogging on through a luminous cloud , so dense that naught was visible save a few yards of roadway and the boundary wall or stone posts on the left side , where lay the lake .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 16]: The brightness soon passed , as the hurrying fog wraiths closed in on each other .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 41]: It became bitterly cold too , and it was with intense gladness that Helen finally stepped from the outer gloom into a glass haven of warmth and light that formed a species of covered-in veranda in front of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 39]: She was about to pay the driver , having added to the agreed sum half the cost of the broken wheel by way of a solatium , when another carriage drove up from the direction of St. Moritz .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 25]: She fancied that the occupant , a young man whom she had never seen before , glanced at her as though he knew her .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 25]: She looked again to make sure ; but by that time his eyes were turned away , so he had evidently discovered his mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 47]: Still , he seemed to take considerable interest in her carriage , and Helen , ever ready to concede the most generous interpretation of doubtful acts , assumed that he had heard of the accident by some means , and was on the lookout for her .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 34]: It would indeed have been a fortunate thing for Helen had some Swiss fairy whispered the news of her mishap in Spencer 's ears during the long drive up the mist laden valley .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 26]: Then , at least , he might have spoken to her , and used the informal introduction to make her further acquaintance on the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 8]: But the knowledge was withheld from him .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 39]: No hint of it was even flashed through space by that wireless telegraphy which has existed between kin souls ever since men and women contrived to raise human affinities to a plane not far removed from the divine .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 31]: He had small store of German , but he knew enough to be perplexed by the way in which Helen 's driver expressed `` beautiful thanks '' for her gift .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 11]: The man seemed to be at once grateful and downhearted .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 23]: Of course , the impression was of the slightest , but Spencer had been trained in reaching vital conclusions on meager evidence .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 34]: He could not wait to listen to Helen 's words , so he passed into the hotel , having the American habit of leaving the care of his baggage to the hall porter .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 27]: He wondered why Helen was so late in arriving that he had caught her up on the very threshold of the Kursaal , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 30]: He would not forget the driver 's face , and if he met the man again , it might be possible to find out the cause of the delay .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 6]: He himself was before time .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 43]: The federal railway authorities at Coire , awaking to the fact that the holiday rush was beginning , had actually dispatched a relief train to St. Moritz when the second important train of the day turned up as full as its predecessor .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 19]: At dinner Helen and he sat at little tables in the same section of the huge dining hall .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 20]: The hotel was nearly full , and it was noticeable that they were the only persons who dined alone .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 24]: Indeed , the head waiter asked Spencer if he cared to join a party of men who sat together ; but he declined .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 24]: There was no such general gathering of women ; so Helen was given no alternative , and she ate the meal in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 12]: She saw Mrs. Vavasour in a remote part of the salon .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 25]: With her was a vacuous looking young man who seldom spoke to her but was continually addressing remarks to a woman at another table .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 32]: `` That is the son lost at Lucerne , '' she decided , finding in his face some of the physical traits but none of the calculating shrewdness of his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 26]: After a repast of many courses Helen wandered into the great hall , found an empty chair , and longed for someone to speak to .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 12]: At the first glance , everybody seemed to know everybody else .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 10]: That was not really the case , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 24]: There were others present as neglected and solitary as Helen ; but the noise and merriment of the greater number dominated the place .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 10]: It resembled a social club rather than a hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 22]: Her chair was placed in an alley along which people had to pass who wished to reach the glass covered veranda .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 20]: She amused herself by trying to pick out the Wraggs , the Burnham-Joneses , and the de la Veres .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 27]: Suddenly she was aware that Mrs. Vavasour and her son were coming that way ; the son unwillingly , the mother with an air of determination .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 10]: Perhaps the Lucerne episode was about to be explained .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 16]: When young Vavasour 's eyes fell on Helen , the boredom vanished from his face .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 19]: It was quite obvious that he called his mother 's attention to her and asked who she was .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 8]: Helen felt that an introduction was imminent .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 6]: She was glad of it .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 19]: At that moment she would have chatted gayly with even a greater ninny than George de Courcy Vavasour .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 27]: But she had not yet grasped the peculiar idiosyncrasies of a woman who was famous for snubbing those whom she considered to be `` undesirables . ''
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 41]: Helen looked up with a shy smile , expecting that the older woman would stop and speak ; but Mrs. Vavasour gazed at her blankly -- looked at the back of her chair through her body -- and walked on .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 14]: `` I do n't know , George , '' Helen heard her say .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 9]: `` There are a lot of new arrivals .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 15]: Some person of no importance , rather déclassée , I should imagine by appearances .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 31]: As I was telling you , the General has arranged -- '' Taken altogether , Helen had crowded into portions of two days many new and some very unpleasant experiences .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 22]: CHAPTER V AN INTERLUDE Helen rose betimes next morning ; but she found that the sun had kept an earlier tryst .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 10]: Not a cloud marred a sky of dazzling blue .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 9]: The phantom mist had gone with the shadows .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 31]: From her bed room window she could see the whole length of the Ober-Engadin , till the view was abruptly shut off by the giant shoulders of Lagrev and Rosatch .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 13]: The brilliance of the coloring was the landscape 's most astounding feature .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 64]: The lakes were planes of polished turquoise , the rocks pure grays and browns and reds , the meadows emerald green , while the shining white patches of snow on the highest mountain slopes helped to blacken by contrast the somber clumps of pines that gathered thick wherever man had not disputed with the trees the tenancy of each foot of meager loam .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 18]: This morning glory of nature gladdened the girl 's heart and drove from it the overnight vapors .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 13]: She dressed hurriedly , made a light breakfast , and went out .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 9]: There was no need to ask the way .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 13]: In front of the hotel the narrow Silser See filled the valley .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 9]: Close behind lay the crest of the pass .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 27]: A picturesque château was perched on a sheer rock overhanging the Vale of Bregaglia and commanding a far flung prospect almost to the brink of Como .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 31]: On both sides rose the mountain barriers ; but toward the east there was an inviting gorge , beyond which the lofty Cima di Rosso flung its eternal snows heavenward .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 7]: A footpath led in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 39]: Helen , who prided herself on her sense of locality , decided that it would bring her to the valley in which were situated , as she learned by the map , a small lake and a glacier .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 26]: `` That will be a fine walk before lunch , '' she said , `` and it is quite impossible to lose the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 26]: So she set off , crossing the hotel golf course , and making for a typical Swiss church that crowned the nearest of the foothills .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 18]: Passing the church , she found the double doors in the porch open , and peeped in .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 20]: It was a cozy little place , cleaner and less garish than such edifices are usually on the Continent .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 16]: The lamp burning before the sanctuary showed that it was devoted to Roman Catholic worship .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 17]: The red gleam of the tiny sentinel conveyed a curiously vivid impression of faith and spirituality .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 24]: Though Helen was a Protestant , she was conscious of a benign emotion arising from the presence of this simple token of belief .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 13]: `` I must ascertain the hours of service , '' she thought .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 13]: `` It will be delightful to join the Swiss peasants in prayer .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 12]: One might come near the Creator in this rustic tabernacle . ''
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 11]: She did not cross the threshold of the inner door .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 14]: At present her mind was fixed on brisk movement in the marvelous air .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 35]: She wanted to absorb the sunshine , to dispel once and for all the unpleasing picture of life in the high Alps presented by the stupid crowd she had met in the hotel overnight .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 27]: Of course , she was somewhat unjust there ; but women are predisposed to trust first impressions , and Helen was no exception to her sex .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 10]: Beyond the church the path was not so definite .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 22]: Oddly enough , it seemed to go along the flat top of a low wall down to a tiny mountain stream .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 41]: Steps were cut in the opposite hillside , but they were little used , and higher up , among some dwarf pines and azaleas , a broader way wound back toward the few scattered chalets that nestled under the château .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 39]: As the guidebook spoke of a carriage road to Lake Cavloccio , and a bridle path thence to within a mile of the Forno glacier , she came to the conclusion that she was taking a short cut .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 35]: At any rate , on the summit of the next little hill she would be able to see her way quite distinctly , so she jumped across the brook and climbed through the undergrowth .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 9]: Before she had gone twenty yards she stopped .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 15]: She was almost certain that someone was sobbing bitterly up there among the trees .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 18]: It had an uncanny sound , this plaint of grief in such a quiet , sunlit spot .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 11]: Still , sorrow was not an affrighting thing to Helen .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 17]: It might stir her sympathies , but it assuredly could not drive her away in panic .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 20]: She went on , not noiselessly , as she did not wish to intrude on some stranger 's misery .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 26]: Soon she came to a low wall , and , before she quite realized her surroundings , she was looking into a grass grown cemetery .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 15]: It was a surprise , this ambush of the silent company among the trees .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 41]: Hidden away from the outer world , and so secluded that its whereabouts remain unknown to thousands of people who visit the Maloja each summer , there was an aspect of stealth in its sudden discovery that was almost menacing .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 8]: But Helen was not a nervous subject .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 31]: The sobbing had ceased , and when the momentary effect of such a depressing environment had been resolutely driven off , she saw that a rusty iron gate was open .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 6]: The place was very small .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 19]: There were a few monuments , so choked with weeds and dank grass that their inscriptions were illegible .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 9]: She had never seen a more desolate graveyard .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 20]: Despite the vivid light and the joyous breeze rustling the pine branches , its air of abandonment was depressing .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 35]: She fought against the sensation as unworthy of her intelligence ; but she had some reason for it in the fact that there was no visible explanation of the mourning she had undoubtedly heard .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 21]: Then she uttered an involuntary cry , for a man 's head and shoulders rose from behind a leafy shrub .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 8]: Instantly she was ashamed of her fear .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 36]: It was the old guide who acted as coachman the previous evening , and he had been lying face downward on the grass in that part of the cemetery given over to the unnamed dead .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 6]: He recognized her at once .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 24]: Struggling awkwardly to his feet , he said in broken and halting German , `` I pray your forgiveness , _ fräulein _ .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 8]: I fear I have alarmed you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 13]: `` It is I who should ask forgiveness , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 7]: `` I came here by accident .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 12]: I thought I could go to Cavloccio by this path . ''
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 20]: She could have hit on no other words so well calculated to bring him back to every day life .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 17]: To direct the steps of wanderers in his beloved Engadine was a real pleasure to him .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 12]: For an instant he forgot that they had both spoken German .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 4]: he cried animatedly .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 8]: `` For lek him go by village .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 5]: Bad road dissa way .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 5]: No cross ze field .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 3]: _ Verboten !
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 19]: _ '' Then Helen remembered that trespassers are sternly warned off the low lying lands in the mountains .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 6]: Grass is scarce and valuable .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 18]: Until the highest pastures yield to the arid rock , pedestrians must keep to the beaten track .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 10]: `` I was quite mistaken , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 16]: `` I see now that the path I was trying to reach leads here only .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 12]: And I am very , very sorry I disturbed you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 16]: -LSB- Illustration : `` I fear I have alarmed you , _ fräulein _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 43]: _ Page 88 _ -RSB- He hobbled nearer , the ruin of a fine man , with a nobly proportioned head and shoulders , but sadly maimed by the accident which , to all appearances , made him useless as a guide .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 17]: `` Pardon an old man 's folly , _ fräulein _ , '' he said humbly .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 22]: `` I thought none could hear , and I felt the loss of my little girl more than ever to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 4]: `` Your daughter ?
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 6]: Is she buried here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 15]: Many a year has passed ; but I miss her now more than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 13]: She was all I had in the world , _ fräulein _ .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 20]: I am alone now , and that is a hard thing when the back is bent with age . ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 15]: Helen 's eyes grew moist ; but she tried bravely to control her voice .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 6]: `` Was she young ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 4]: she asked softly .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 19]: `` Only twenty , _ fräulein _ , only twenty , and as tall and fair as yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 11]: They carried her here sixteen years ago this very day .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 7]: I did not even see her .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 10]: On the previous night I fell on Corvatsch . ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 6]: `` Oh , how sad !
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 9]: But why did she die at that age ?
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 6]: And in this splendid climate ?
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 6]: Was her death unexpected ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 4]: `` Unexpected ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 20]: He turned and looked at the huge mountain of which the cemetery hill formed one of the lowermost buttresses .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 30]: `` If the Piz della Margna were to topple over and crush me where I stand , it would be less unforeseen than was my sweet Etta 's fate .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 15]: But I frighten you , lady , -- a poor return for your kindness .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 29]: That is your way , -- through the village , and by the postroad till you reach a notice board telling you where to take the path . ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 17]: There was a crude gentility in his manner that added to the pathos of his words .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 14]: Helen was sure that he wished to be left alone with his memories .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 4]: Yet she lingered .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 11]: `` Please tell me your name , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 20]: `` I may visit St. Moritz while I remain here , and I shall try to find you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 8]: `` Christian Stampa , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 15]: He seemed to be on the point of adding something , but checked himself .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 12]: `` Christian Stampa , '' he repeated , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 8]: `` Everybody knows old Stampa the guide .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 21]: If I am not there , and you go to Zermatt some day -- well , just ask for Stampa .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 11]: They will tell you what has become of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 21]: She found it hard to reconcile this broken , careworn old man with her cheery companion of the previous afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 5]: What did he mean ?
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 25]: She understood his queer jargon of Italianized German quite clearly ; but there was a sinister ring in his words that blanched her face .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 10]: She could not leave him in his present mood .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 21]: She was more alarmed now than when she saw him rising ghostlike from behind the screen of grass and weeds .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 13]: `` Please walk with me to the village , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 10]: `` All this beautiful land is strange to me .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 19]: It will divert your thoughts from a mournful topic if you tell me something of its wonders . ''
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 8]: He looked at her for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 24]: Then his eyes fell on the church in the neighboring hollow , and he crossed himself , murmuring a few words in Italian .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 5]: She guessed their meaning .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 21]: He was thanking the Virgin for having sent to his rescue a girl who reminded him of his lost Etta .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' he said , `` I will come .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 34]: If I were remaining in the Maloja , _ fräulein _ , I would beg you to let me take you to the Forno , and perhaps to one of the peaks beyond .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 16]: Old as I am , and lame , you would be safe with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 5]: Helen breathed freely again .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 13]: She felt that she had been within measurable distance of a tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 28]: Nor was there any call on her wits to devise fresh means of drawing his mind away from the madness that possessed him a few minutes earlier .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 15]: As he limped unevenly by her side , his talk was of the mountains .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 6]: Did she intend to climb ?
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 10]: Well , slow and sure was the golden rule .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 23]: Do little or nothing during four or five days , until she had grown accustomed to the thin and keen Alpine air .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 16]: Then go to Lake Lunghino , -- that would suffice for the first real excursion .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 37]: Next day , she ought to start early , and climb the mountain overlooking that same lake , -- up there , on the other side of the hotel , -- all rock and not difficult .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 17]: If the weather was clear , she would have a grand view of the Bernina range .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 8]: Next she might try the Forno glacier .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 6]: It was a simple thing .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 14]: She could go to and from the _ cabane _ in ten hours .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 19]: Afterward , the Cima di Rosso offered an easy climb ; but that meant sleeping at the hut .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 30]: All of which was excellent advice , though the reflection came that Stampa 's `` slow and sure '' methods were not strongly in evidence some sixteen hours earlier .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 14]: Now , the Cima di Rosso was in full view at that instant .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 3]: Helen stopped .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 29]: `` Do you really mean to tell me that if I wish to reach the top of that mountain , I must devote two days to it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 17]: Stampa , though bothered with troubles beyond her ken , forgot them sufficiently to laugh grimly .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 23]: `` It is farther away than you seem to think , _ fräulein _ ; but the real difficulty is the ice .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 35]: Unless you cross some of the crevasses in the early morning , before the sun has had time to undo the work accomplished by the night 's frost , you run a great risk .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 18]: And that is why you must be ready to start from the _ cabane _ at dawn .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 18]: Moreover , at this time of year , you get the finest view about six o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 8]: The mention of crevasses was somewhat awesome .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 14]: `` Is it necessary to be roped when one tries that climb ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 29]: `` If any guide ever tells you that you need not be roped while crossing ice or climbing rock , turn back at once , _ fräulein _ .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 15]: Wait for another day , and go with a man who knows his business .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 12]: That is how the Alps get a bad name for accidents .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 4]: Look at me !
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 29]: I have climbed the Matterhorn forty times , and the Jungfrau times out of count , and never did I or anyone in my care come to grief .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 42]: ` Use the rope properly , ' is my motto , and it has never failed me , not even when two out of five of us were struck senseless by falling stones on the south side of Monte Rosa . ''
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 5]: Helen experienced another thrill .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 13]: `` I very much object to falling stones , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 9]: Stampa threw out his hands in emphatic gesture .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 7]: `` What can one do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 17]: `` They are always a danger , like the snow cornice and the _ névé _ .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 21]: There is a chimney on the Jungfrau through which stones are constantly shooting from a height of two thousand feet .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 15]: You can not see them , -- they travel too fast for the eye .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 12]: You hear something sing past your ears , that is all .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 27]: Occasionally there is a report like a gunshot , and then you observe a little cloud of dust rising from a new scar on a rock .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 19]: If you are hit -- well , there is no dust , because the stone goes right through .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 9]: Of course one does not loiter there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 14]: Then , seeing the scared look on her face , he went on .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 9]: `` Ladies should not go to such places .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 5]: It is not fit .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 6]: But for men , yes .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 7]: There is the joy of battle .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 14]: Do not err , _ fräulein _ , -- the mountains are alive .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 7]: And they fight to the death .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 12]: They can be beaten ; but there must be no mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 9]: They are like strong men , the hills .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 17]: When you strive against them , strain them to your breast and never relax your grip .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 35]: Then they yield slowly , with many a trick and false move that a man must learn if he would look down over them all and say , ' I am lord here . '
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 3]: Ah me !
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 15]: Shall I ever again cross the Col du Lion or climb the Great Tower ?
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 3]: But there !
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 8]: I am old , and thrown aside .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 14]: Boys whom I engaged as porters would refuse me now as their porter .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 19]: Better to have died like my friend , Michel Croz , than live to be a goatherd . ''
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 10]: He seemed to pull himself up with an effort .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 15]: `` That way -- to your left -- you can not miss the path .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 23]: _ Addio , sigñorina _ , '' and he lifted his hat with the inborn grace of the peasantry of Southern Europe .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 13]: Helen was hoping that he might elect to accompany her to Cavloccio .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 11]: She would willingly have paid him for loss of time .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 13]: Her ear was becoming better tuned each moment to his strange patois .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 21]: Though he often gave a soft Italian inflection to the harsh German syllables , she grasped his meaning quite literally .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 26]: She had read so much about Switzerland that she knew how Michel Croz was killed while descending the Matterhorn after having made the first ascent .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 10]: That historic accident happened long before she was born .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 48]: To hear a man speak of Croz as a friend sounded almost unbelievable , though a moment 's thought told her that Whymper , who led the attack on the hitherto impregnable Cervin on that July day in 1865 , was still living , a keen Alpinist .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 30]: She could not refrain from asking Stampa one question , though she imagined that he was now in a hurry to take the damaged carriage back to St. Moritz .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 12]: `` Michel Croz was a brave man , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 8]: `` Did you know him well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 15]: `` I worshiped him , _ fräulein _ , '' was the reverent answer .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 25]: `` May I receive pardon in my last hour , but I took him for an evil spirit on the day of his death !
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 12]: I was with Jean Antoine Carrel in Signor Giordano 's party .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 12]: We started from Breuil , Croz and his voyageurs from Zermatt .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 6]: We failed ; he succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 34]: When we saw him and his Englishmen on the summit , we believed they were devils , because they yelled in triumph , and started an avalanche of stones to announce their victory .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 17]: Three days later , Carrel and I , with two men from Breuil , tried again .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 28]: We gained the top that time , and passed the place where Croz was knocked over by the English milord and the others who fell with him .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 24]: I saw three bodies on the glacier four thousand feet below , -- a fine burial-ground , better than that up there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 15]: He looked back at the pines which now hid the cemetery wall from sight .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 23]: Then , with another courteous sweep of his hat , he walked away , covering the ground rapidly despite his twisted leg .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 26]: If Helen had been better trained as a woman journalist , she would have regarded this meeting with Stampa as an incident of much value .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 16]: Long experience of the lights and shades of life might have rendered her less sensitive .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 12]: As it was , the man 's personality appealed to her .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 37]: She had been vouchsafed a glimpse into an abyss profound as that into which Stampa himself peered on the day he discovered three of the four who fell from the Matterhorn still roped together in death .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 20]: The old man 's simple references to the terrors lurking in those radiant mountains had also shaken her somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 12]: The snow capped Cima di Rosso no longer looked so attractive .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 10]: The Orlegna Gorge had lost some of its beauty .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 20]: Though the sun was pouring into its wooded depths , it had grown gloomy and somber in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 47]: Yielding to impulse , she loitered in the village , took the carriage road to the château , and sat there , with her back to the inner heights and her gaze fixed on the smiling valley that opened toward Italy out of the Septimer Pass .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 33]: Meanwhile , Stampa hurried past the stables , where his horses were munching the remains of the little oaten loaves which form the staple food of hard worked animals in the Alps .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 33]: He entered the hotel by the main entrance , and was on his way to the manager 's bureau , when Spencer , smoking on the veranda , caught sight of him .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 7]: Instantly the American started in pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 18]: By this time he had heard of Helen 's accident from one of yesterday 's passers by .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 17]: It accounted for the delay ; but he was anxious to learn exactly what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 6]: Stampa reached the office first .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 33]: He was speaking to the manager , when Spencer came in and said in his downright way : `` This is the man who drove Miss Wynton from St. Moritz last night .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 14]: I do n't suppose I shall be able to understand what he says .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 11]: Will you kindly ask him what caused the trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 14]: `` It is quite an easy matter , '' was the smiling response .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 32]: `` Poor Stampa is not only too eager to pass every other vehicle on the road , but he is inclined to watch the mountains rather than his horses ' ears .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 24]: He was a famous guide once ; but he met with misfortune , and took to carriage work as a means of livelihood .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 32]: He has damaged his turnout twice this year ; so this morning he was dismissed by telephone , and another driver is coming from St. Moritz to take his place . ''
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 5]: Spencer looked at Stampa .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 17]: He liked the strong , worn face , with its half wistful , half resigned expression .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 37]: An uneasy feeling gripped him that the whim of a moment in the Embankment Hotel might exert its crazy influence in quarters far removed from the track that seemed then to be so direct and pleasure-giving .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 16]: `` Why did he want to butt in between the other fellow and the landscape ?
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 8]: What was the hurry , anyhow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 11]: Stampa smiled genially when the questions were translated to him .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 31]: `` I was talking to the _ sigñorina _ , '' he explained , using his native tongue , for he was born on the Italian side of the Bernina .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 21]: `` That counts , but it gives no good reason why he should risk her life , '' objected Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 7]: Stampa 's weather furrowed cheeks reddened .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 11]: `` There was no danger , '' he muttered wrathfully .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 3]: `` Madonna !
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 17]: I would lose the use of another limb rather than hurt a hair of her head .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 7]: Is she not my good angel ?
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 12]: Has she not drawn me back from the gate of hell ?
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 4]: Risk her life !
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 16]: Are people saying that because a worm-eaten wheel went to pieces against a stone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 10]: `` What on earth is he talking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 3]: demanded Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 18]: `` Has he been pestering Miss Wynton this morning with some story of his present difficulties ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 7]: The manager knew Stampa 's character .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 8]: He put the words in kindlier phrase .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 15]: `` Does the _ sigñorina _ know that you have lost your situation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 13]: Even in that mild form , the suggestion annoyed the old man .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 15]: He flung it aside with scornful gesture , and turned to leave the office .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 31]: `` Tell the gentleman to go to Zermatt and ask in the street if Christian Stampa the guide would throw himself on a woman 's charity , '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 8]: Spencer did not wait for any interpretation .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 9]: `` Hold on , '' he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 9]: `` What is he going to do now ?
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 20]: Work , for a man of his years , does n't grow on gooseberry bushes , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 5]: `` Christian , Christian !
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 12]: You are hot-headed as a boy , '' cried the manager .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 20]: `` The fact is , '' he went on , `` he came to me to offer his services .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 19]: But I have already engaged more drivers than I need , and I am dismissing some stable men .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 11]: Perhaps he can find a job in St. Moritz . ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 9]: `` Are his days as guide ended ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 5]: `` Unfortunately , yes .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 16]: I believe he is as active as ever ; but people wo n't credit it .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 7]: And you can not blame them .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 35]: When one 's safety depends on a man who may have to cling to an ice covered rock like a fly to a window-pane , one is apt to distrust a crooked leg . ''
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 8]: `` Did he have an accident ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 4]: The manager hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 13]: `` It is part of his sad history , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 27]: `` He fell , and nearly killed himself ; but he was hurrying to see the last of a daughter to whom he was devoted . ''
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 10]: `` Is he a local man , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 4]: Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 12]: The girl happened to be here when the end came . ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 27]: `` Well , I guess he will suit my limited requirements in the fly and window-pane business while I remain in Maloja , '' said Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 26]: `` Tell him I am willing to put up ten francs a day and extras for his exclusive services as guide during my stay . ''
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 11]: Poor Stampa was nearly overwhelmed by this unexpected good fortune .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 27]: In his agitation he blurted out , `` Ah , then , the good God did really send an angel to my help this morning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 28]: Spencer , however , reviewing his own benevolence over a pipe outside the hotel , expressed the cynical opinion that the hot sun was affecting his brain .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 12]: `` I 'm on a loose end , '' he communed .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 17]: `` Next time I waft myself to Europe on a steamer I 'll bring my mother .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 14]: It would be a bully fine notion to cable for her right away .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 9]: I want someone to take care of me .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 14]: It looks as if I had a cinch on running this hotel gratis .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 8]: What in thunder will happen next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 24]: He could surely have answered that query if he had the least inkling of the circumstances governing Helen 's prior meeting with Stampa .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 13]: As it was , the development of events followed the natural course .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 38]: While Spencer strolled off by the side of the lake , the old guide lumbered into the village street , and waited there , knowing that he would waylay the _ bella Inglesa _ on her return .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 19]: Though she came from the château and not from Cavloccio , he did not fail to see her .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 32]: At first she was at a loss to fathom the cause of Stampa 's delight , and still less to understand why he should want to thank her with such exuberance .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 28]: She imagined he was overjoyed at having gone back to his beloved profession , and it was only by dint of questioning that she discovered the truth .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 74]: Then it dawned on her that the man had been goaded to desperation by the curt message from St. Moritz , -- that he was sorely tempted to abandon the struggle , and follow into the darkness the daughter taken from him so many years ago , -- and the remembrance of her suspicion when they were about to part at the cemetery gate lent a serious note to her words of congratulation .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 21]: `` You see , Stampa , '' she said , `` you were very wrong to lose faith this morning .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 18]: At the very moment of your deepest despair Heaven was providing a good friend for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 9]: `` Yes , indeed , _ fräulein _ .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 7]: That is why I waited here .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 8]: I felt that I must thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 6]: It was all through you .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 30]: The good God sent you -- '' `` I think you are far more beholden to the gentleman who employed you than to me , '' she broke in .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 23]: `` Yes , he is splendid , the young _ voyageur _ ; but it was wholly on your account , lady .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 24]: He was angry with me at first , because he thought I placed you in peril in the matter of the wheel . ''
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 4]: Helen was amazed .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 7]: `` He spoke of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 5]: `` Ah , yes .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 13]: He did not say much , but his eyes looked through me .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 14]: He has the eyes of a true man , that young American . ''
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 7]: She was more bewildered than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 7]: `` What is his name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 5]: `` Here it is .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 18]: The director wrote it for me , so that I may learn how to pronounce it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 18]: Stampa produced a scrap of paper , and Helen read , `` Mr. Charles K. Spencer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 10]: `` Are you quite certain he mentioned me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 3]: she repeated .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 10]: `` Can I be mistaken , _ fräulein _ .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 12]: I know , because I studied the labels on your boxes .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 6]: Mees Hélène Weenton -- so ?
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 11]: And did he not rate me about the accident ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 34]: `` Well , wonders will never cease , '' she vowed ; and indeed they were only just beginning in her life , which shows how blind to excellent material wonders can be .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 8]: At luncheon she summoned the head waiter .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 14]: `` Is there a Mr. Charles K. Spencer staying in the hotel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 6]: `` Yes , madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 14]: `` Will you please tell me if he is in the room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 5]: The head waiter turned .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 6]: Spencer was studying the menu .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 5]: `` Yes , madam .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 16]: There he is , sitting alone , at the second table from the window . ''
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 19]: It was quite to be expected that the subject of their joint gaze should look at them instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 44]: There is a magnetism in the human eye that is unfailing in that respect , and its power is increased a hundredfold when a charming young woman tries it on a young man who happens to be thinking of her at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 35]: Then Spencer realized that Stampa had told Helen what had taken place in the hotel bureau , and he wanted to kick himself for having forgotten to make secrecy a part of the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 10]: Helen , knowing that he knew , blushed furiously .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 14]: She tried to hide her confusion by murmuring something to the head waiter .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 16]: But in her heart she was saying , `` Who in the world is he ?
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 9]: I have never seen him before last night .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 24]: And why am I such an idiot as to tremble all over just because he happened to catch me looking at him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 21]: CHAPTER VI THE BATTLEFIELD Both man and woman were far too well bred to indulge in an _ oeillade _ .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 27]: The knowledge that each was thinking of the other led rather to an ostentatious avoidance of anything that could be construed into any such flirtatious overture .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 28]: Though Stampa 's curious statement had puzzled Helen , she soon hit on the theory that the American must have heard of the accident to her carriage .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 8]: Yes , that supplied a ready explanation .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 13]: No doubt he kept a sharp lookout for her on the road .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 27]: He arrived at the hotel almost simultaneously with herself , and she had not forgotten his somewhat inquiring glance as they stood together on the steps .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 38]: With the chivalry of his race in all things concerning womankind , he was eager to render assistance , and under the circumstances he probably wondered what sort of damsel in distress it was that needed help .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 24]: It was natural enough too that in engaging Stampa he should refer to the carelessness that brought about the collapse of the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 20]: Really , when one came to analyze an incident seemingly inexplicable , it resolved itself into quite commonplace constituents .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 22]: She found it awkward that he should be sitting between her and a window commanding the best view of the lake .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 24]: If Spencer had been at any other table , she could have feasted her eyes on the whole expanse of the Ober-Engadin Valley .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 19]: Therefore she had every excuse for looking that way , whereas he had none for gazing at her .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 9]: Spencer appeared to be aware of this disability .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 25]: For lack of better occupation he scrutinized the writing on the menu with a prolonged intentness worthy of a gourmand or an expert graphologist .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 16]: Helen rose first , and that gave him an opportunity to note her graceful carriage .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 43]: Though born in the States , he was of British stock , and he did not share the professed opinion of the American humorist that the typical Englishwoman is angular , has large feet , and does not know how to walk .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 14]: Helen , at any rate , betrayed none of these elements of caricature .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 47]: Though there were several so-called `` smart '' women in the hotel , -- women who clung desperately to the fringe of Society on both sides of the Atlantic , -- his protégée was easily first among the few who had any claim to good looks .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 18]: Helen was not only tall and lithe , but her movements were marked by a quiet elegance .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 34]: It was her custom , in nearly all weathers , to walk from Bayswater to Professor von Eulenberg 's study , which , needless to say , was situated near the British Museum .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 22]: She usually returned by a longer route , unless pelting rain or the misery of London snow made the streets intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 35]: Thus there was hardly a day that she did not cover eight miles at a rapid pace , a method of training that eclipsed all the artifices of beauty doctors and schools of deportment .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 54]: Her sweetly pretty face , her abundance of shining brown hair , her slim , well proportioned figure , and the almost athletic swing of her well arched shoulders , would entitle her to notice in a gathering of beauties far more noted than those who graced Maloja with their presence that year .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 20]: In addition to these physical attractions she carried with her the rarer and indefinable aura of the born aristocrat .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 48]: As it happened , she merited that description both by birth and breeding ; but there is a vast company entitled to consideration on that score to whom nature has cruelly denied the necessary hallmarks -- otherwise the pages of Burke would surely be embellished with portraits .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 75]: Indeed , so far as appearance went , it was rather ludicrous to regard Helen as the social inferior of any person then resident in the Kursaal , and it is probable that a glimmering knowledge of this fact inflamed Mrs. de Courcy Vavasour 's wrath to boiling point , when a few minutes later , she saw her son coolly walk up to the `` undesirable '' and enter into conversation with her .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 8]: Helen was seated in a shady corner .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 14]: A flood of sunlight filled the glass covered veranda with a grateful warmth .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 48]: She had picked up an astonishingly well written and scholarly guide book issued by the proprietors of the hotel , and was deep in its opening treatise on the history and racial characteristics of the Engadiners , when she was surprised at hearing herself addressed by name .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 13]: `` Er -- Miss -- er -- Wynton , I believe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 5]: said a drawling voice .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 27]: Looking up , she found George de Courcy Vavasour bending over her in an attitude that betokened the utmost admiration for both parties to the tête-à-tête .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 59]: Under ordinary conditions , -- that is to say , if Vavasour 's existence depended on his own exertions , -- Helen 's eyes would have dwelt on a gawky youth endowed with a certain pertness that might in time have brought him from behind the counter of a drapery store to the wider arena of the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 23]: As it was , a reasonably large income gave him unbounded assurance , and his credit with a good tailor was unquestionable .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 12]: He represented a British product that flourishes best in alien soil .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 41]: There exists a foreign legion of George de Courcy Vavasours , flaccid heroes of fashion plates , whose parade grounds change with the seasons from Paris to the Riviera , and from the Riviera to some nook in the Alps .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 40]: Providence and a grandfather have conspired in their behalf to make work unnecessary ; but Providence , more far-seeing than grandfathers , has decreed that they shall be effete and light brained , so the type does not endure .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 31]: Helen , out of the corner of her eye , became aware that Mrs. de Courcy Vavasour was advancing with all the plumes of the British matron ruffled for battle .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 20]: It was not in human nature that the girl should not recall the slight offered her the previous evening .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 19]: With the thought came the temptation to repay it now with interest ; but she thrust it aside .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 15]: `` Yes , that is my name , '' she said , smiling pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 24]: `` Well -- er -- the General has asked me to -- er -- invite you take part in some of our tournaments .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 22]: We have tennis , you know , an ' golf , an ' croquet , an ' that sort of thing .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 19]: Of course , you play tennis , an ' I rather fancy you 're a golfer as well .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 12]: You look that kind of girl -- Eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 36]: He caressed a small mustache as he spoke , using the finger and thumb of each hand alternately , and Helen noticed that his hands were surprisingly large when compared with his otherwise fragile frame .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 7]: `` Who is the General ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 3]: she inquired .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 8]: `` Oh , Wragg , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 14]: He looks after everything in the amusement line , an ' I help .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 14]: Do let me put you down for the singles an ' mixed doubles .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 23]: None of the women here can play for nuts , an ' I have n't got a partner yet for the doubles .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 14]: I 've been waitin ' for someone like you to turn up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 16]: `` You have not remained long in suspense , '' she could not help saying .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 11]: `` You are Mr. Vavasour , are you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 9]: `` Yes , better known as Georgie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 12]: `` And you arrived in Maloja last evening , I think .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 25]: Well , I do play tennis , or rather , I used to play fairly well some years ago -- '' `` By gad !
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 5]: just what I thought .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 21]: Go slow in your practice games , Miss Wynton , an ' you 'll have a rippin ' handicap . ''
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 8]: `` Would that be quite honest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 16]: said Helen , lifting her steadfast brown eyes to meet his somewhat too free scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 3]: `` Honest ?
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 2]: Rather !
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 21]: You wait till you see the old guard pullin ' out a bit when they settle down to real business .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 10]: But the General is up to their little dodges .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 28]: He knows their form like a book , an ' he gets every one of 'em shaken out by the first round -- Eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 19]: `` The arrangement seems to be ideal if one is friendly with the General , '' said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 6]: Vavasour drew up a chair .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 47]: He also drew up the ends of his trousers , thus revealing that the Pomeranian brown and myrtle green stripes in his necktie were faithfully reproduced in his socks , while these master tints were thoughtfully developed in the subdominant hues of his clothes and boots .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 4]: `` By Jove !
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 15]: what a stroke of luck I should have got hold of you first ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 3]: he chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 12]: `` I 'm pretty good at the net , Miss Wynton .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 44]: If we manage things properly , we ought to have the mixed doubles a gift with plus half forty , an ' in the ladies ' singles you 'll be a Queen 's Club champion at six-stone nine -- Eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 34]: Though Vavasour represented a species of inane young man whom Helen detested , she bore with him because she hungered for the sound of an English voice in friendly converse this bright morning .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 19]: At times her life was lonely enough in London ; but she had never felt her isolation there .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 11]: The great city appealed to her in all its moods .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 15]: Her cheerful yet sensitive nature did not shrink from contact with its hurrying crowds .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 42]: The mere sense of aloofness among so many millions of people brought with it the knowledge that she was one of them , a human atom plunged into a heedless vortex the moment she passed from her house into the street .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 7]: Here in Maloja things were different .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 37]: While her own identity was laid bare , while men and women canvassed her name , her appearance , her occupation , she was cut off from them by a social wall of their own contriving .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 17]: The attitude of the younger women told her that trespassers were forbidden within that sacred fold .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 27]: She knew now that she had done a daring thing -- outraged one of the cheap conventions -- in coming alone to this clique-ridden Swiss valley .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 47]: Better a thousand times have sought lodgings in some small village inn , and mixed with the homely folk who journeyed thither on the diligence or tramped joyously afoot , than strive to win the sympathy of any of these shallow nonentities of the smart set .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 53]: Even while listening to `` Georgie 's '' efforts to win her smiles with slangy confidences , she saw that Mrs. Vavasour had halted in mid career , and joined a group of women , evidently a mother and two daughters , and that she herself was the subject of their talk .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 4]: She wondered why .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 52]: She was somewhat perplexed when the conclave broke up suddenly , the girls going to the door , Mrs. Vavasour retreating majestically to the far end of the veranda , and the other elderly woman drawing a short , fat , red faced man away from a discussion with another man .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 11]: `` Jolly place , this , '' Vavasour was saying .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 8]: `` There 's dancin ' most nights .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 44]: The dowager brigade want the band to play classical music , an ' that sort of rot , you know ; but Mrs. de la Vere and the Wragg girls like a hop , an ' we generally arrange things our own way .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 36]: We 'll have a dance to-night if you wish it ; but you must promise to -- '' `` Georgie , '' cried the pompous little man , `` I want you a minute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 4]: Vavasour swung round .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 12]: Evidently he regarded the interruption as `` a beastly bore . ''
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 11]: `` All right , General , '' he said airily .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 7]: `` I 'll be there soon .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 7]: No hurry , is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 9]: `` Yes , I want you now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 5]: The order was emphatic .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 19]: The General 's only military asset was a martinet voice , and he made the most of it .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 18]: `` Rather rotten , is n't it , interferin ' with a fellow in this way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 3]: muttered Vavasour .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 6]: `` Will you excuse me ?
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 12]: I must see what the old boy is worryin ' about .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 11]: I shall come back soon -- Eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 17]: `` I am going out , '' said Helen ; `` but we shall meet again .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 7]: I remain here a month . ''
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 9]: `` You 'll enter for the tournament ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 6]: he asked over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 6]: `` I -- think so .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 8]: It will be something to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 4]: `` Thanks awfully .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 7]: And do n't forget to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 3]: Helen laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 6]: She could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 16]: The younger members of the Wragg family were eying her sourly through the glass partition .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 39]: They seemed to be nice girls too , and she made up her mind to disillusion them speedily if they thought that she harbored designs on the callow youth whom they probably regarded as their own special cavalier .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 30]: When she passed through the inner doorway to go to her room she noticed that the General was giving Georgie some instructions which were listened to in sulky silence .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 21]: Indeed , that remarkable ex-warrior was laying down the law of the British parish with a clearness that was admirable .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 10]: He had been young himself once , -- dammit !
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 49]: -- and had as keen an eye for a pretty face as any other fellow ; but no gentleman could strike up an acquaintance with an unattached female under the very nose of his mother , not to mention the noses of other ladies who were his friends .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 6]: Georgie broke out in protest .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 27]: `` Oh , but I say , General , she is a lady , an ' you yourself said -- '' `` I know I did .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 4]: I was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 12]: Even a wary old bird like me can make a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 10]: Mrs. Vavasour has just warned my wife about her .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 11]: It 's no good arguing , Georgie , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 10]: Nowadays you ca n't draw the line too rigidly .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 12]: Things permissible in Paris or Nice wo n't pass muster here .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 6]: I 'm sorry , Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 12]: She 's a high stepper and devilish taking , I admit .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 19]: Writes for some ha ` penny rag -- er -- for some cheap society paper , I hear .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 20]: Why , dash it all , she will be lampooning us in it before we know where we are .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 14]: Just you go and tell your mother you 'll behave better in future .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 6]: Excellent woman , Mrs. Vavasour .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 6]: She never makes a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 2]: Gad !
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 24]: do n't you remember how she spotted that waiter from the Ritz who gulled the lot of us at the Jetée last winter ?
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 35]: Took him for the French marquis he said he was , every one of us , women and all , till Mrs. V. fixed her eye on him and said , ` Gustave ! '
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 2]: Damme !
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 6]: how he curled up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 5]: George was still obdurate .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 10]: A masquerading waiter differed from Helen in many essentials .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 13]: `` He was a Frenchman , an ' they 're mostly rotters .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 32]: This girl is English , General , an ' I shall look a proper sort of an ass if I freeze up suddenly after what I 've said to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 18]: `` Not for the first time , my boy , and mebbe not for the last . ''
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 19]: Then , in view of the younger man 's obvious defiance , the General 's white mustache bristled .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 30]: `` Of course , you can please yourself , '' he growled : `` but neither Mrs. Wragg nor my daughters will tolerate your acquaintance with that person ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 14]: `` Oh , all right , General , '' came the irritated answer .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 38]: `` Between you an ' the mater I 've got to come to heel ; but it 's a beastly shame , I say , an ' you 're all makin ' a jolly big mistake . ''
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 24]: Georgie 's intelligence might be superficial ; but he knew a lady when he met one , and Helen had attracted him powerfully .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 40]: He was thanking his stars for the good fortune that numbered him among the earliest of her acquaintances in the hotel , and it was too bad that the barring edict should have been issued against her so unexpectedly .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 21]: But he was not of a fighting breed , and he quailed before the threat of Mrs. Wragg 's displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 44]: Helen , after a delightful ramble past the château and along the picturesque turns and twists of the Colline des Artistes , returned in time for tea , which was served on the veranda , the common rendezvous of the hotel during daylight .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 6]: No one spoke to her .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 23]: She went out again , and walked by the lake till the shadows fell and the mountains glittered in purple and gold .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 24]: She dressed herself in a simple white evening frock , dined in solitary state , and ventured into the ball room after dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 21]: Georgie was dancing with Mrs. de la Vere , a languid looking woman who seemed to be pining for admiration .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 26]: At the conclusion of the waltz that was going on when Helen entered , Vavasour brought his partner a whisky and soda and a cigarette .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 21]: He passed Helen twice , but ignored her , and whirled one of the Wragg girls off into a polka .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 15]: Again he failed to see her when parties were being formed for a quadrille .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 34]: Even to herself she did not attempt to deny a feeling of annoyance , though she extracted a bitter amusement from the knowledge that she had been slighted by such a vapid creature .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 11]: She was under no misconception as to what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 10]: The women were making a dead set against her .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 15]: If she had been plain or dowdy , they might have been friendly enough .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 29]: It was an unpardonable offense that she should be good looking , unchaperoned , and not one of the queerly assorted mixture they deemed their _ monde _ .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 9]: For a few minutes she was really angry .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 9]: She realized that her only crime was poverty .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 36]: Given a little share of the wealth held by many of these passée matrons and bold-eyed girls , she would be a reigning star among them , and could act and talk as she liked .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 27]: Yet her shyness and reserve would have been her best credentials to any society that was constituted on a sounder basis than a gathering of snobs .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 23]: Among really well-born people she would certainly have been received on an equal footing until some valid reason for ostracism was forthcoming .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 17]: The imported limpets on this Swiss rock of gentility were not sure of their own grip .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 17]: Hence , they strenuously refused to make room for a newcomer until they were shoved aside .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 5]: Poor , disillusioned Helen !
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 29]: When she went to church she prayed to the good Lord to deliver her and everybody else from envy , hatred , and malice , and all uncharitableness .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 30]: She felt now that there might well be added to the Litany a fresh petition which should include British communities on the Continent in the list of avoidable evils .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 18]: At that instant the piquant face and figure of Millicent Jaques rose before her mind 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 28]: She pictured to herself the cool effrontery with which the actress would crush these waspish women by creating a court of every eligible man in the place .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 48]: It was not a healthy thought , but it was the offspring of sheer vexation , and Helen experienced her second temptation that day when de la Vere , the irresistible `` Reginald '' of Mrs. Vavasour 's sketchy reminiscences , came and asked her to dance .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 6]: She recognized him at once .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 21]: He sat with Mrs. de la Vere at table , and never spoke to her unless it was strictly necessary .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 33]: He had distinguished manners , a pleasant voice , and a charming smile , and he seemed to be the devoted slave of every pretty woman in the hotel except his wife .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 18]: `` Please pardon the informality , '' he said , with an affability that cloaked the impertinence .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 10]: `` We are quite a family party at Maloja .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 24]: I hear you are staying here some weeks , and we are bound to get to know each other sooner or later . ''
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 5]: Helen could dance well .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 27]: She was so mortified by the injustice meted out to her that she almost accepted de la Vere 's partnership on the spur of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 22]: But her soul rebelled against the man 's covert insolence , and she said quietly : `` No , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 8]: I do not care to dance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 9]: `` May I sit here and talk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 3]: he persisted .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 24]: `` I am just going , '' she said , `` and I think Mrs. de la Vere is looking for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 35]: By happy chance the woman in question was standing alone in the center of the ball room , obviously in quest of some man who would take her to the foyer for a cigarette .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 15]: Helen retreated with the honors of war ; but the irresistible one only laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 14]: `` That idiot Georgie told the truth , then , '' he admitted .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 11]: `` And she knows what the other women are saying .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 13]: What cats these dear creatures can be , to be sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 8]: Spencer happened to be an interested onlooker .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 38]: Indeed , he was trying to arrive at the best means of obtaining an introduction to Helen when he saw de la Vere stroll leisurely up to her with the assured air of one sated by conquest .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 13]: The girl brushed close to him as he stood in the passage .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 11]: She held her head high and her eyes were sparkling .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 36]: He had not heard what was said ; but de la Vere 's discomfiture was so patent that even his wife smiled as she sailed out on the arm of a youthful purveyor of cigarettes .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 25]: Spencer longed for an opportunity to kick de la Vere ; yet , in some sense , he shared that redoubtable lady-killer 's rebuff .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 22]: He too was wondering if the social life of a Swiss hotel would permit him to seek a dance with Helen .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 24]: Under existing conditions , it would provide quite a humorous episode , he told himself , to strike up a friendship with her .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 33]: He could not imagine why she had adopted such an aloof attitude toward all and sundry ; but it was quite evident that she declined anything in the guise of promiscuous acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 9]: And he , like her , felt lonely .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 29]: There were several Americans in the hotel , and he would probably meet some of the men in the bar or smoking room after the dance was ended .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 25]: But he would have preferred a pleasant chat with Helen that evening , and now she had gone to her room in a huff .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 7]: Then an inspiration came to him .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 17]: `` Guess I 'll stir up Mackenzie to send along an introduction , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 8]: `` A telegram will fix things . ''
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 35]: It was not quite so easy to explain matters in the curt language of the wire , he found , and it savored of absurdity to amaze the beer-drinking Scot with a long message .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 11]: So he compromised between desire and expediency by a letter .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 18]: `` DEAR MR. MACKENZIE , '' he wrote , `` life is not rapid at this terminus .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 23]: It might take on some new features if I had the privilege of saying ` How de do ' to Miss Wynton .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 53]: Will you oblige me by telling her that one of your best and newest friends happens to be in the same hotel as her charming self , and that if she gets him to sparkle , he -LRB- which is I -RRB- will help considerable with copy for ` The Firefly . '
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 35]: Advise me by same post , and the rest of the situation is up to yours faithfully , `` C. K. S. '' The letter was posted , and Spencer waited five tiresome days .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 11]: He saw little or nothing of Helen save at meals .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 68]: Once he met her on a footpath that runs through a wood by the side of the lake to the little hamlet of Isola , and he was minded to raise his hat , as he would have done to any other woman in the hotel whom he encountered under similar circumstances ; but she deliberately looked away , and his intended courtesy must have passed unheeded .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 37]: As he sedulously avoided any semblance of dogging her footsteps , he could not know how she was being persecuted by de la Vere , Vavasour , and one or two other men of like habit .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 7]: That knowledge was yet to come .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 45]: Consequently he deemed her altogether too prudish , and was so out of patience with her that he and Stampa went off for a two days ' climb by way of the Muretto Pass to Chiareggio and back to Sils-Maria over the Fex glacier .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 37]: Footsore and tired , but thoroughly converted to the marvels of the high Alps , he reached the Kursaal side by side with the postman who brought the chief English mail about six o'clock each evening .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 16]: He waited with an eager crowd of residents while the hall porter sorted the letters .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 21]: There were some for him from America , and one from London in a handwriting that was strange to him .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 33]: But he had quick eyes , and he saw that a letter addressed to Miss Helen Wynton , in the flamboyant envelope of `` The Firefly , '' bore the same script .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 7]: Mackenzie had risen to the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 8]: He even indulged in a classical joke .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 16]: `` There is something in the name of Helen that attracts , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 42]: `` Were it not for the lady whose face drew a thousand ships to Ilium , we should never have heard of Paris , or Troy , or the heel of Achilles , and all these would be greatly missed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 42]: `` And I should never have heard of Mackenzie or Maloja , '' thought Spencer , sinking into a chair and looking about to learn whether or not the girl would find her letter before he went to dress for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 8]: He was sure she knew his name .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 28]: Perhaps when she read the editor 's note , she too would search the spacious lounge with those fine eyes of hers for the man described therein .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 44]: If that were so , he meant to go to her instantly , discuss the strangeness of the coincidence that led to two of Mackenzie 's friends being at the hotel at the same time , and suggest that they should dine together .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 13]: The project seemed feasible , and it was decidedly pleasant in perspective .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 47]: He longed to compare notes with her , -- to tell her the quaint stories of the hills related to him by Stampa in a medley of English , French , Italian , and German ; perhaps to plan delightful trips to the fairyland in company .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 17]: People began to clear away from the hall porter 's table ; yet Helen remained invisible .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 21]: He could hardly have missed her ; but to make certain he rose and glanced at the few remaining letters .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 14]: Yes , `` The Firefly 's '' gaudy imprint still gleamed at him .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 6]: He turned way , disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 28]: After his long tramp and a night in a weird Italian inn , a bath was imperative , and the boom of the dressing gong was imminent .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 14]: He was crossing the hall toward the elevator when he heard her voice .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 29]: `` I am so glad you are keen on an early climb , '' she was saying , with a new note of confidence that stirred him strangely .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 33]: `` I have been longing to leave the sign boards and footpaths far behind , but I felt rather afraid of going to the Forno for the first time with a guide .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 22]: You see , I know nothing about mountaineering , and you can put me up to all the dodges beforehand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 19]: `` Show you the ropes , in fact , '' agreed the man with her , Mark Bower .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 21]: Spencer was so completely taken by surprise that he could only stare at the two as though they were ghosts .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 16]: They had entered the hotel together , and had apparently been out for a walk .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 20]: Helen picked up her letter and held it carelessly in her hand while she continued to talk with Bower .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 6]: Her pleasurable excitement was undeniable .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 16]: She regarded her companion as a friend , and was evidently overjoyed at his presence .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 27]: Spencer banged into the elevator , astonished the attendant and two other occupants by the savagery of his command , `` Au deuxième , vite ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 13]: and paced through a long corridor with noisy clatter of hob-nailed boots .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 16]: He was in a rare fret and fume when he sat down to dinner alone .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 7]: Bower was at Helen 's table .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 13]: It was brightened by rare flowers not often seen in sterile Maloja .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 13]: A bottle of champagne rested in an ice bucket by his side .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 25]: He had brought with him the atmosphere of London , of the pleasant life that London offers to those who can buy her favors .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 24]: Truly this Helen , all unconsciously , had not only found the heel of a modern Achilles , but was wounding him sorely .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 48]: For now Spencer knew that he wanted to see her frank eyes smiling into his as they were smiling into Bower 's , and , no matter what turn events took , a sinister element had been thrust into a harmless idyl by this man 's arrival .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 16]: CHAPTER VII SOME SKIRMISHING Later , the American saw the two sitting in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 10]: They were chatting with the freedom of old friends .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 15]: Helen 's animated face showed that the subject of their talk was deeply interesting .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 33]: She was telling Bower of the slights inflicted on her by the other women ; but Spencer interpreted her intent manner as supplying sufficient proof of a stronger emotion than mere friendliness .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 7]: He was beginning to detest Bower .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 14]: It was his habit to decide quickly when two ways opened before him .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 7]: He soon settled his course now .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 18]: To remain in the hotel under present conditions involved a loss of self respect , he thought .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 27]: He went to the bureau , asked for his account , and ordered a carriage to St. Moritz for the morrow 's fast train to England .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 6]: The manager was politely regretful .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 16]: `` You are leaving us at the wrong time , sir , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 25]: `` Within the next few days we ought to have a midsummer storm , when even the lower hills will be covered with snow .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 13]: Then , we usually enjoy a long spell of magnificent weather . ''
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 7]: `` Sorry , '' said Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 47]: `` I like the scramble up there , '' and he nodded in the direction of the Bernina range , `` and old Stampa is a gem of a guide ; but I can hardly put off any longer some business that needs attention in England .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 11]: Anyhow , I shall come back , perhaps next month .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 11]: Stampa says it is all right here in September . ''
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 27]: `` Our best month , I assure you , and the ideal time to drop down into Italy when you are tired of the mountains . ''
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 9]: `` I must let it go at that .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 18]: I intend to fix Stampa so that he can remain here till the end of the season .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 9]: So you see I mean to return . ''
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 18]: `` He was very fortunate in meeting you , Mr. Spencer , '' said the manager warmly .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 13]: `` Well , it is time he had a slice of luck .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 10]: I 've taken a fancy to the old fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 16]: One night , in the Forno hut , he told me something of his story .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 15]: I guess it will please him to stop at the Maloja for awhile . ''
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 9]: `` He told you about his daughter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 5]: came the tentative question .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 4]: `` Not all .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 13]: I am afraid there was no difficulty in filling in the blanks .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 15]: I heard enough to make me respect him and sympathize with his troubles . ''
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 21]: The manager shook his head , with the air of one who recalls that which he would willingly have forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 12]: `` Such incidents are rare in Switzerland , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 10]: `` I well remember the sensation her death created .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 7]: She was such a pretty girl .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 17]: The young men at Pontresina called her ` The Edelweiss ' because she was so inaccessible .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 48]: In fact , poor Stampa had educated her beyond her station , and that is not always good for a woman , especially in these quiet valleys , where knowledge of cattle and garden produce is a better asset than speaking French and playing the piano . ''
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 3]: Spencer agreed .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 12]: He could name other districts where the same rule held good .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 14]: He stood for a moment in the spacious hall to light a cigar .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 6]: Involuntarily he glanced at Helen .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 20]: She met his gaze , and said something to Bower that caused the latter also to turn and look .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 20]: `` She has read Mackenzie 's letter , '' thought Spencer , taking refuge behind a cloud of smoke .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 18]: `` It will be bad behavior on my part to leave the hotel without making my bow .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 13]: Shall I go to her now , or wait till morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 11]: He reflected that Helen might be out early next day .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 30]: If he presented his introduction at once , she would probably ask him to sit with her a little while , and then he must become acquainted with Bower .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 40]: He disliked the notion ; but he saw no way out of it , unless indeed Helen treated him with the chilling abruptness she meted out to other men in the hotel who tried to become friendly with her .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 15]: He was weighing the pros and cons dispassionately , when the English chaplain approached .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 10]: `` Do you play bridge , Mr. Spencer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 21]: `` I know the leads , and call ` without ' on the least provocation , '' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 27]: `` You are the very man I am searching for , and I have the authority of the First Book of Samuel in my quest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 22]: `` Well , now , that is the last place in which I should expect to find my bridge portrait . ''
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 25]: `` Do n't you remember how Saul 's servants asked his permission to ` seek out a man who is a cunning player ' ?
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 8]: That is exactly what I am doing .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 6]: Come to the smoking room .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 17]: There are two other men there , and one is a fellow countryman of yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 33]: The Rev. Mr. Hare was a genial soul , a Somersetshire vicar who took his annual holiday by accepting a temporary position in some Alpine village where there was an English church .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 40]: He did not dream that he was acting the part of Hermes , messenger of the gods , at that moment , for indeed his appearance on the scene just then changed the whole trend of Spencer 's actions .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 9]: `` What a delightful place this is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 12]: he went on as they walked together through a long corridor .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 10]: `` But what is the matter with the people ?
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 5]: They do n't mix .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 17]: I would not have believed that there were so many prigs in the British Isles . ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 24]: Some such candid opinion had occurred to Spencer ; but , being an American , he thought that perhaps he might be mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 14]: `` The English character is somewhat adaptable to environment , I have heard .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 14]: That is why you send out such excellent colonists , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 19]: `` Does n't that go rather to prove that everybody here should be hail fellow well met ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 5]: `` Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 28]: They take their pose from the Alps , -- snow , glaciers , hard rock , you know , -- that is the subtlety of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 4]: The vicar laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 15]: `` You have given me a new point of view , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 9]: `` Some of them are slippery customers too .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 11]: Yes , one might carry the parallel a long way .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 5]: But here we are .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 10]: Now , mind you cut me as a partner .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 16]: I have tried the others , and found them severely critical -- as bridge players .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 6]: You look a stoic . ''
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 6]: The vicar had his wish .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 18]: Spencer and he opposed a man from Pittsburg , named Holt , and Dunston , an Englishman .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 27]: While the latter was shuffling the cards for Hare 's deal he said something that took one , at least , of his hearers by surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 9]: `` Bower has turned up , I see .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 28]: What has brought him to the Engadine at this time of year I ca n't guess , unless perhaps he is interested in a pretty face . ''
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 12]: `` At this time of the year , '' repeated Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 8]: `` Is n't this the season ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 5]: `` Not for him .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 21]: He used to be a famous climber ; but he has given it up since he waxed fat and prosperous .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 14]: I have met him once or twice at St. Moritz in the winter .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 37]: Otherwise , he usually shows up in the fashionable resorts in August , -- Ostend , or Trouville , or , if he is livery , Vichy or Aix-les-Bains , -- anywhere but this quiet spot .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 5]: Bower likes excitement too .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 27]: He often opens a thousand pound bank at baccarat , whereas people are shocked in Maloja at seeing Hare play bridge at tenpence a hundred . ''
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 21]: `` I leave it , partner , '' broke in the vicar , to whom the game was the thing .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 17]: `` No trumps , '' said Spencer , without giving the least heed to his cards .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 47]: It was true his eyes were resting on the ace , king , and queen of spades ; but his mind was tortured by the belief that by his fantastic conceit in sending Helen to this Alpine fastness he had delivered her bound to the vultures .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 23]: `` Double no trumps , '' said Dunston , gloating over the possession of a long suit of hearts and three aces .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 12]: Hare looked anxious , and Spencer suddenly awoke to the situation .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 7]: `` Satisfied , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 23]: Holt led the three of hearts , and Spencer spread his cards on the table with the gravity of a Sioux chief .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 12]: In addition to the three high spades he held six others .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 4]: `` Really ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 11]: gasped the parson , `` a most remarkable declaration ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 37]: Yet there was an agitated triumph in his voice that was not pleasant hearing for Dunston , who took the trick with the ace of hearts and led the lowest of a sequence to the queen .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 5]: `` Got him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 7]: panted Hare , producing the king .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 5]: The rest was easy .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 15]: The vicar played a small spade and scored ninety-six points without any further risk .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 18]: `` It is magnificent ; but it is not bridge , '' said the man from Pittsburg .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 4]: Dunston simply glowered .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 26]: `` Partner , '' demanded Hare timidly , `` may I ask why you called ` no trumps ' on a hand like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 16]: `` Thought I would give you a chance of distinguishing yourself , '' replied Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 17]: `` Besides , that sort of thing rattles your opponents at the beginning of a game .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 19]: Keep your nerve now , _ padre _ , and you have 'em in a cleft stick . ''
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 30]: As it happened , Holt made a `` no trump '' declaration on a very strong hand ; but Spencer held seven clubs headed by the ace and king .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 3]: He doubled .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 3]: Holt redoubled .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 4]: Spencer doubled again .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 4]: Hare flushed somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 37]: `` Allow me to say that I am very fond of bridge ; but I can not take part in a game that savors of gambling , even for low stakes , '' he broke in .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 13]: `` Shall we let her go at forty-eight points a trick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 3]: Spencer asked .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 4]: `` Yep ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 3]: snapped Holt .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 7]: `` Got all the clubs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 9]: `` Not all -- sufficient , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 5]: He played the ace .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 10]: Dunston laid the queen and knave on the table .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 12]: Spencer scored the winning trick before his adversary obtained an opening .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 18]: `` You have a backbone of cast steel , '' commented Dunston , who was an iron-master .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 7]: `` Do you play baccarat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 8]: he went on , with curious eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 17]: `` I regret to state that my education was completed in a Western mining camp . ''
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 18]: `` Will you excuse the liberty , and perhaps Mr. Hare wo n't listen for a moment ?
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 27]: -- but I will finance you in three banks of a thousand each , either banking or punting , if you promise to take on Bower .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 6]: I can arrange it easily .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 16]: I say this because you personally may not care to play for high sums . ''
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 28]: The suggestion was astounding , coming as it did from a stranger ; but Spencer merely said : `` You do n't like Bower , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 5]: `` That is so .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 18]: I have business relations with him occasionally , and there he is all that could be wished .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 25]: But I have seen him clean out more than one youngster ruthlessly , -- force the play to too high stakes , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 8]: I think you could take his measure .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 10]: Anyhow , I am prepared to back you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 8]: `` I 'm leaving here to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 11]: `` Ah , well , we may have another opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 8]: If so , my offer holds . ''
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 21]: `` Guess you have n't heard that Spencer is the man who bored a tunnel through the Rocky Mountains ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 3]: said Holt .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 7]: You must tell me about it .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 12]: Sorry , Mr. Hare , I am stopping the game . ''
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 20]: Spencer continued to have amazing good fortune , and he played with skill , but without any more fireworks .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 23]: At the close of the sitting the vicar said cheerfully : `` You are not a ladies ' man , Mr. Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 15]: You know the old proverb , -- lucky at cards , unlucky in love ?
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 14]: But let me hope that it does not apply in your case . ''
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 19]: `` Talking about a ladies ' man , who is the girl your friend Bower dined with ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 3]: asked Holt .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 30]: `` She has been in the hotel several days ; but she did n't seem to be acquainted with anybody in particular until he blew in this afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 13]: `` She is a Miss Helen Wynton , '' said the vicar .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 15]: `` I like her very much from what little I have seen of her .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 27]: She attended both services on Sunday , and I happen to be aware of the fact that she was at mass in the Roman church earlier .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 22]: I wanted her to play the harmonium next Sunday ; but she declined , and gave me her reasons too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 9]: `` May I ask what they were ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 3]: inquired Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 12]: `` Well , speaking in confidence , they were grievously true .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 23]: Some miserable pandering to Mrs. Grundy has set the other women against her ; so she declined to thrust herself into prominence .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 13]: I tried to talk her out of it , but failed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 9]: `` Who is Mrs. Grundy , anyhow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 3]: growled Holt .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 4]: The others laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 14]: `` She is the Medusa of modern life , '' explained the vicar .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 11]: `` She turns to stone those who gaze on her .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 11]: Most certainly she petrifies all good feeling and Christian tolerance .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 28]: Why , I actually heard a woman whose conduct is not usually governed by what I hold to be good taste sneer at Miss Wynton this evening .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 11]: ` The murder is out now , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 8]: ` Bower 's presence explains everything . '
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 16]: Yet I am able to state that Miss Wynton was quite unprepared for his arrival .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 38]: By chance I was standing on the steps when he drove up to the hotel , and it was perfectly clear from the words they used that neither was aware that the other was in Maloja . ''
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 7]: Spencer leaned over toward the iron-master .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 22]: `` Tell you what , '' he said ; `` I 've changed my mind about the trip to England to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 7]: Get up that game with Bower .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 15]: I 'll stand the racket myself unless you want to go half shares . ''
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 3]: `` Done !
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 10]: I should like to have an interest in it .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 31]: Not that I am pining for Bower 's money , and it may be that he will win ours ; but I am keen on giving him a sharp run .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 20]: At Nice last January not a soul in the Casino would go Banco when he opened a big bank .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 7]: They were afraid of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 18]: While he was speaking , Dunston 's shrewd eyes dwelt on the younger man 's unmoved face .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 11]: He wondered what had caused this sudden veering of purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 24]: It was certainly not the allurement of heavy gambling , for Spencer had declined the proposal as coolly as he now accepted it .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 16]: Being a man of the world , he thought he could peer beneath the mask .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 12]: To satisfy himself , he harked back to the personal topic .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 14]: `` By the way , does anyone know who Miss Wynton is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 27]: `` That inveterate gossip , Mrs. Vavasour , who can vouch for every name in the Red Book , says she is a lady journalist . ''
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 15]: `` That , at any rate , is correct , '' said the vicar .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 12]: `` In fact , Miss Wynton herself told me so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 9]: `` Jolly fine girl , whatever she is .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 16]: To give Bower his due , he has always been a person of taste . ''
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 26]: `` I have reason to believe , '' said Spencer , `` that Miss Wynton 's acquaintance with Mr. Bower is of the slightest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 7]: His words were slow and clear .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 18]: Dunston , sure now that his guess was fairly accurate , hastened to efface an unpleasant impression .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 34]: `` Of course , I only meant that if Bower is seen talking to any woman , it may be taken for granted that she is a pretty one , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 8]: `` But who 's for a drink ?
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 15]: Perhaps we shall meet our expected opponent in the bar , Mr. Spencer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 8]: `` I have some letters to write .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 17]: Fix that game for to-morrow or next day , and I 'll be on hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 14]: Dunston and Holt paid the few shillings they owed , and went out .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 5]: Hare did not move .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 7]: He looked anxious , almost annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 19]: `` It is exceedingly ridiculous how circumstances pass beyond a man 's control occasionally , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 23]: `` Am I right in assuming that until this evening neither Bower nor Dunston was known to you , Mr. Spencer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 6]: `` Absolutely correct , vicar .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 20]: I have never yet spoken to Bower , and you heard all that passed between Dunston and myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 28]: `` Then my harmless invitation to you to join in a game at cards has led directly to an arrangement for play at absurdly high figures ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 34]: `` It seems to me , Mr. Hare , that Bower 's tracks and mine are destined to cross in more ways than one in the near future , '' said Spencer coolly .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 18]: But the vicar was not to be switched away from the new thought that was troubling him .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 19]: `` I will not ask what you mean , '' he said , gazing steadfastly at the American .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 17]: `` My chief concern is the outcome of my share in this evening 's pleasant amusement .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 32]: I can not shut my ears to the fact that you have planned the loss or gain of some thousands of pounds on the turn of a card at baccarat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 16]: `` If it is disagreeable to you -- '' `` How can it be otherwise ?
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 41]: I am a broad-minded man , and I see no harm whatever in playing bridge for pennies ; but I am more pained than I care to confess at the prospect of such a sequel to our friendly meeting to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 40]: If this thing happens , -- if a small fortune is won or lost merely to gratify Dunston 's whim , -- I assure you that I shall never touch a card again as long as I live . ''
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 4]: Then Spencer laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 14]: `` That would be too bad , Mr. Hare , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 6]: `` Make your mind easy .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 5]: The game is off .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 14]: Count on me for the tenpence a hundred limit after dinner to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 12]: `` Now , that is quite good and kind of you .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 10]: Dunston made me very miserable by his mad proposition .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 58]: Of course , both he and Bower are rich men , men to whom a few thousand pounds are of little importance ; or , to be accurate , they profess not to care whether they win or lose , though their wealth is not squandered so heedlessly when it is wanted for some really deserving object .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 6]: But perhaps that is uncharitable .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 19]: My only wish is to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your generous promise . ''
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 8]: `` Is Bower so very rich then ?
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 7]: Have you met him before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 7]: `` He is a reputed millionaire .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 10]: I read of him in the newspapers at times .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 14]: In my small country parish such financial luminaries twinkle from a far sky .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 9]: It is true he is a recent light .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 14]: He made a great deal of money in copper , I believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 19]: `` What kind of character do you give him , -- good , bad , or indifferent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 15]: Hare 's benevolent features showed the astonishment that thrilled him at this blunt question .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 12]: `` I hardly know what to say -- '' he stammered .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 11]: Spencer liked this cheery vicar and resolved to trust him .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 9]: `` Let me explain , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 16]: `` You and I agree in thinking that Miss Wynton is an uncommonly nice girl .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 16]: I am not on her visiting list at present , so my judgment is altruistic .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 22]: Suppose she was your daughter or niece , would you care to see her left to that man 's mercies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 9]: The clergyman fidgeted a little before he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 14]: Spencer was a stranger to him , yet he felt drawn toward him .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 9]: The strong , clear cut face won confidence .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 26]: `` If it was the will of Heaven , I would sooner see her in the grave , '' he said , with solemn candor .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 3]: Spencer rose .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 6]: He held out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 24]: `` I guess it 's growing late , '' he cried , `` and our talk has swung round to a serious point .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 6]: Sleep well , Mr. Hare .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 7]: That game is dead off . ''
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 19]: As he passed the bar he heard Bower 's smooth , well rounded accents through the half-open door .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 12]: `` Nothing I should like better , '' he was saying .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 5]: `` Are you tired ?
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 11]: If not , bring your friend to my rooms now .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 18]: Although I have been in the train all night , I am fit as a fiddle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 5]: `` Let me see .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 35]: I left him in the smoking room with our _ padre _ -- '' It was Dunston who spoke ; but Bower broke in : `` Oh , keep the clergy out of it !
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 15]: They make such a song about these things if they hear of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 19]: `` I was going to say that if he is not there he will be in his room .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 13]: He is two doors from me , No. 61 , I think .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 6]: Shall I fetch him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 7]: `` Do , by all means .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 3]: By Jove !
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 12]: I did n't expect to get any decent play here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 15]: Spencer slipped into a small vestibule where he had left a hat and overcoat .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 13]: He remained there till Dunston crossed the hall and entered the elevator .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 17]: Then he went out , meaning to stroll and smoke in the moonlight for an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 19]: It would be easier to back out of the promised game in the morning than at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 24]: Moreover , in the clear , still air he could plan a course of action , the need of which was becoming insistent .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 17]: He was blessed , or cursed , with a stubborn will , and he knew it .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 24]: Hitherto , it had been exercised on a theory wrapped in hard granite , and the granite had yielded , justifying the theory .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 29]: Now he was brought face to face with a woman 's temperament , and his experience of that elusive and complex mixture of attributes was of the slightest .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 25]: Attractive young women in Colorado are plentiful as cranberries ; but never one of them had withdrawn his mind 's eye from his work .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 20]: Why , then , was he so ready now to devote his energies to the safeguarding of Helen Wynton ?
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 24]: It was absurd to pretend that he was responsible for her future well-being because of the whim that sent her on a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 10]: She was well able to take care of herself .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 48]: She had earned her own living before he met her ; she had risen imperiously above the petty malice displayed by some of the residents in the hotel ; there was a reasonable probability that she might become the wife of a man highly placed and wealthy .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 11]: Every consideration told in favor of a policy of non-interference .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 33]: The smoking of an inch of good cigar placed the matter in such a convincing light that Spencer was half resolved to abide by his earlier decision and leave Maloja next morning .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 18]: But the other half , made up of inclination , pleaded against all the urging of expediency .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 16]: He deemed the vicar an honest man , and that stout-hearted phrase of his stuck .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 19]: Yet , whether he went or stayed , the ultimate solution of the problem lay with Helen herself .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 15]: Once on speaking terms with her , he could form a more decided view .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 25]: It was wonderful how one 's estimate of a man or woman could be modified in the course of a few minutes ' conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 19]: Well , he would settle things that way , and meanwhile enjoy the beauty of a wondrous night .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 19]: A full moon was flooding the landscape with a brilliance not surpassed in the crystal atmosphere of Denver .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 29]: The snow capped summit of the Cima di Rosso was fit to be a peak in Olympus , a silver throned height where the gods sat in council .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 21]: The brooding pines perched on the hillside beyond the Orlegna looked like a company of gigantic birds with folded wings .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 30]: From the road leading to the village he could hear the torrent itself singing its mad song of freedom after escaping from the icy caverns of the Forno glacier .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 39]: Quite near , on the right , the tiny cascade that marks the first seaward flight of the Inn mingled its sweet melody with the orchestral thunder of the more distant cataracts plunging down the precipices toward Italy .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 43]: It was a night when one might listen to the music of the spheres , and Spencer was suddenly jarred into unpleasant consciousness of his surroundings by the raucous voices of some peasants bawling a Romansch ballad in a wayside wine house .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 14]: Turning sharply on his heel , he took the road by the lake .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 19]: There at least he would find peace from the strenuous amours of Margharita as trolled by the revelers .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 26]: He had not gone three hundred yards before he saw a woman standing near the low wall that guarded the embanked highway from the water .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 22]: She was looking at the dark mirror of the lake , and seemed to be identifying the stars reflected in it .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 20]: Three or four times , as he approached , she tilted her head back and gazed at the sky .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 52]: The skirt of a white dress was visible below a heavy ulster ; a knitted shawl was wrapped loosely over her hair and neck , and the ends were draped deftly across her shoulders ; but before she turned to see who was coming along the road Spencer had recognized her .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 33]: Thus , in a sense , he was a trifle the more prepared of the two for this unforeseen meeting , and he hailed it as supplying the answer to his doubts .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 27]: `` Now , '' said he to himself , `` I shall know in ten seconds whether or not I travel west by north to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 8]: Helen did not avert her glance instantly .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 22]: Nor did she at once resume a stroll evidently interrupted to take in deep breaths of the beauty of the scene .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 16]: That was encouraging to the American , -- she expected him to speak to her .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 9]: He halted in the middle of the road .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 13]: If he was mistaken , he did not wish to alarm her .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 33]: `` If you will pardon the somewhat unorthodox time and place , I should like to make myself known to you , Miss Wynton , '' he said , lifting his cap .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 7]: `` You are Mr. Spencer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 8]: she answered , with a frank smile .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 14]: `` Yes , I have a letter of introduction from Mr. Mackenzie . ''
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 5]: `` So have I .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 6]: What do we do next ?
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 3]: Exchange letters ?
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 7]: Mine is in the hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 7]: `` Suppose we just shake ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 12]: `` Well , that is certainly the most direct way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 4]: Their hands met .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 10]: They were both aware of a whiff of nervousness .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 15]: For some reason , the commonplace greetings of politeness fell awkwardly from their lips .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 16]: In such a predicament a woman may always be trusted to find the way out .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 60]: `` It is rather absurd that we should be saying how pleased we are that Mr. Mackenzie thought of writing those letters , while in reality I am horribly conscious that I ought not to be here at all , and you are probably thinking that I am quite an amazing person , '' and Helen laughed light heartedly .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 12]: `` That is part of my thought , '' said Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 10]: `` Wo n't you tell me the remainder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 5]: `` May I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 4]: `` Please do .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 7]: I am in chastened mood . ''
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 20]: `` I wish I was skilled in the trick of words , then I might say something real cute .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 56]: As it is , I can only supply a sort of condensed statement , -- something about a nymph , a moonlit lake , the spirit of the glen , -- nice catchy phrases every one , -- with a line thrown in from Shelley about an ` orbéd maiden with white fire laden . '
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 23]: Let me go back a hundred yards , Miss Wynton , and I shall return with the whole thing in order . ''
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 14]: `` With such material I believe you would bring me a sonnet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 22]: I hail from the wild and woolly West , where life itself is a poem ; so I stick to prose .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 16]: There is a queer sort of kink in human nature to account for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 18]: `` On the principle that a Londoner never hears the roar of London , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 3]: `` Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 14]: An old lady I know once came across a remarkable instance of it .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 35]: She watched a ship-wreck , the real article , with all the scenic accessories , and when a half drowned sailor was dragged ashore she asked him how he felt at that awful moment .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 9]: And what do you think he said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 8]: `` Very wet , '' laughed Helen .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 9]: `` No , that is the other story .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 9]: This man said he was very dry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 45]: `` Ah , the one step from the sublime to the ridiculous , which reminds me that if I remain here much longer talking nonsense I shall lose the good opinion I am sure you have formed of me from Mr. Mackenzie 's letter .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 9]: Why , it must be after eleven o'clock !
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 17]: Are you going any farther , or will you walk with me to the hotel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 20]: `` If you will allow me -- '' `` Indeed , I shall be very glad of your company .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 9]: I came out to escape my own thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 18]: Did you ever meet such an unsociable lot of people as our fellow boarders , Mr. Spencer ?
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 39]: If it was not for my work , and the fact that I have taken my room for a month , I should hie me forthwith to the beaten track of the vulgar but good natured tourist . ''
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 5]: `` Why not go ?
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 11]: Let me help you to-morrow to map out a tour .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 19]: Then I shall know precisely where to waylay you , for I feel the chill here too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 36]: `` I wish I could fall in with the first part of your proposal , though the second rather suggests that you regard Mr. Mackenzie 's letter of introduction as a letter of marque . ''
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 18]: `` At any rate , I am an avowed pirate , '' he could not help retorting .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 18]: `` But to keep strictly to business , why not quit if you feel like wandering ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 24]: `` Because I was sent here , on a journalistic mission which I understand less now than when I received it in London .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 10]: Of course , I am delighted with the place .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 9]: It is the people I -- kick at ?
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 8]: Is that a quite proper Americanism ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 22]: `` It seems to fit the present case like a glove , or may I say , like a shoe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 18]: `` Now you are laughing at me , inwardly of course , and I agree with you .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 17]: Ladies should not use slang , nor should they promenade alone in Swiss valleys by moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 16]: My excuse is that I did not feel sleepy , and the moon tempted me .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 4]: Good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 23]: They were yet some little distance from the hotel , and Spencer was at a loss to account for this sudden dismissal .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 10]: She saw the look of bewilderment in his face .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 17]: `` I have found a back stairs door , '' she explained , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 28]: `` I really do n't think I should have dared to come out at half-past ten if I had to pass the Gorgons in the foyer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 42]: She flitted away by a side path , leaving Spencer more convinced than ever that he had blundered egregiously in dragging this sedate and charming girl from the quiet round of existence in London to the artificial life of the Kursaal .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 14]: Some feeling of unrest had driven her forth to commune with the stars .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 29]: Was she asking herself why she was denied the luxuries showered on the doll-like creatures whose malicious tongues were busy the instant Bower set foot in the hotel ?
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 19]: It would be an ill outcome of his innocent subterfuge if she returned to England discontented and rebellious .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 12]: She was in `` chastened mood , '' she had said .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 4]: He wondered why ?
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 17]: Had Bower been too confident , -- too sure of his prey to guard his tongue ?
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 38]: Of all the unlooked for developments that could possibly be bound up with the harmless piece of midsummer madness that sent Helen Wynton to Switzerland , surely this roué 's presence was the most irritating and perplexing .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 16]: Then from the road came another stanza from the wine bibbers , now homeward bound .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 11]: They were still howling about Margharita in long sustained cadences .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 6]: And Spencer knew his Faust .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 32]: It was to the moon that the lovesick maiden confided her dreams , and Mephisto was at hand to jog the elbow of his bewitched philosopher at exactly the right moment .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 12]: Spencer threw his cigar into the gurgling rivulet of the Inn .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 80]: He condemned Switzerland , and the Upper Engadine , and the very great majority of the guests in the Kursaal , in one emphatic malediction , and went to his room , hoping to sleep , but actually to lie awake for hours and puzzle his brains in vain effort to evolve a satisfying sequel to the queer combination of events he had set in motion when he ran bare headed into the Strand after Bower 's motor car .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 10]: CHAPTER VIII SHADOWS `` It is a glorious morning .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 20]: If the weather holds , your first visit to the real Alps should be memorable , '' said Bower .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 15]: Helen had just descended the long flight of steps in front of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 8]: A tender purple light filled the valley .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 38]: The nearer hills were silhouetted boldly against a sky of primrose and pink ; but the misty depths where the lake lurked beneath the pines had not yet yielded wholly to the triumph of the new day .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 14]: The air had a cold life in it that invigorated while it chilled .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 11]: It resembled some _ vin frappé _ of rare vintage .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 18]: Its fragrant vivacity was ready to burst forth at the first encouraging hint of a kindlier temperature .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 11]: `` Why that dubious clause as to the weather ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 22]: asked Helen , looking at the golden shafts of sunlight on the topmost crags of Corvatsch and the Piz della Margna .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 27]: Those far off summits were so startlingly vivid in outline that they seemed to be more accessible than the mist shrouded ravines cleaving their dun sides .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 16]: It needed an effort of the imagination to correct the erring testimony of the eye .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 19]: `` The moods of the hills are variable , my lady , -- femininely fickle , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 65]: There is a proverb that contrasts the wind with woman 's mind ; but the disillusioned male who framed it evidently possessed little knowledge of weather changes in the high Alps , or else he -- '' `` Did you beguile me out of my cozy room at six o'clock on a frosty morning to regale me with stale jibes at my sex ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 8]: `` Perish the thought , Miss Wynton !
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 25]: My only intent was to explain that the ancient proverb maker , meaning to be rude , might have found a better simile . ''
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 24]: `` Meanwhile , I am so cold that the only mood left in my composition is one of impatience to be moving . ''
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 8]: `` Well , I am ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 8]: `` But where is our guide ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 12]: `` He has gone on in front with the porter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 3]: `` Porter !
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 7]: What is the man carrying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 13]: `` The wherewithal to refresh ourselves when we reach the hut . ''
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 19]: `` Oh , '' said Helen , `` I had no idea that mountaineering was such a business .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 14]: I thought the essentials were a packet of sandwiches and a flask . ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 8]: `` You will please not be flippant .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 5]: Climbing is serious work .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 7]: And you must moderate your pace .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 25]: If you walk at that rate from here to Forno , you will be very , very ill before you reach the hut . ''
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 3]: `` Ill !
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 4]: How absurd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 15]: `` Not only absurd but disagreeable , -- far worse than crossing the Channel .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 25]: Even old hands like me are not free from mountain sickness , though it seizes us at higher altitudes than we shall reach to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 23]: In the case of a novice , anything in the nature of hurrying during the outward journey is an unfailing factor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 18]: They were crossing the golf links , and the smooth path was tempting to a good walker .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 12]: Helen smiled as she accommodated herself to Bower 's slower stride .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 32]: Though the man might possess experience , the woman had the advantage of youth , the unattainable , and this wonderful hour after dawn was stirring its ichor in her veins .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 24]: `` I suppose that is what Stampa meant when he took ` Slow and Sure ' for his motto , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 3]: `` Stampa !
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 5]: Who is Stampa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 11]: There was a sudden rasp of iron in his voice .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 21]: As a rule Bower spoke with a cultivated languor that almost veiled the staccato accents of the man of affairs .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 20]: Helen was so surprised by this unwarranted clang of anger that she looked at him with wide open eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 30]: `` He is the driver I told you of , the man who took the wheel off my carriage during the journey from St. Moritz , '' she explained .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 6]: `` Oh , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 7]: How stupid of me to forget !
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 13]: But , by the way , did you mention his name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 7]: `` No , I think not .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 4]: Someone interrupted me .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 22]: Mr. Dunston came and spoke to you -- '' He laughed gayly and drew in deep breaths of the keen air .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 11]: He was carrying his ice ax over his left shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 11]: With his right hand he brushed away a disturbing thought .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 4]: `` By Jove !
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 2]: yes !
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 26]: Dunston dragged me off to open a bank at baccarat , and you will be glad to hear that I won five hundred pounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 15]: `` I am glad you won ; but who lost so much money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 9]: `` Dunston dropped the greater part of it .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 22]: Your American friend , Mr. Spencer , was rather inclined to brag of his prowess in that direction , it appears .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 24]: He even went so far as to announce his willingness to play for four figures ; but he backed out of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 21]: `` Do you mean that Mr. Spencer wanted to stake a thousand pounds on a single game at cards ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 17]: `` Evidently he did not want to do it , but he talked about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 20]: `` Yet he impressed me as being a very clear-headed and sensible young man , '' said Helen decisively .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 13]: `` Here , young lady , I must call you to account !
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 11]: In what category do you place me , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 7]: `` Oh , you are different .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 46]: I disapprove of anyone playing for such high stakes ; but I suppose you are used to it and can afford it , whereas a man who has his way to make in the world would be exceedingly foolish to do such a thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 17]: `` Pray , how did you come to measure the extent of Spencer 's finances ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 4]: `` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 6]: Did I say that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 5]: `` I am sorry .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 11]: Of course , I had no wish to speak offensively .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 24]: What I mean is that he may be quite as well able to run a big bank at baccarat as I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 47]: `` He was telling me yesterday of his early struggles to gain a footing in some mining community in Colorado , and the impression his words left on me was that he is still far from wealthy ; that is , as one understands the term .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 7]: Here we are at the footpath .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 21]: Shall we follow it and scramble up out of the ravine , or do you prefer the carriage road ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 6]: `` The footpath , please .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 34]: But before we drop the subject of cards , which is unquestionably out of place on a morning like this , let me say that perhaps I have done the American an injustice .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 6]: Dunston is given to exaggeration .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 18]: He has so little control over his face that it is rank robbery to bet with him .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 10]: Such a man is apt to run to extremes .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 20]: It may be that Spencer was only talking through his hat , as they say in New York . ''
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 14]: Helen had the best of reasons for rejecting this version of the story .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 16]: Her perceptive faculties , always well developed , were strung to high tension in Maloja .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 19]: The social pinpricks inflicted there had rendered her more alert , more cautious , than was her wont .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 29]: She was quite sure , for instance , judging from a number of slight indications , that Spencer was deliberately avoiding any opportunity of making Bower 's acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 17]: More than once , when an introduction seemed to be imminent , the American effaced himself .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 19]: Other men in the hotel were not like that -- they rather sought the great man 's company .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 8]: She wondered if Bower had noticed it .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 27]: Despite his candid , almost generous , disclaimer of motive , there was an undercurrent of hostility in his words that suggested a feeling of pique .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 12]: She climbed the rocky path in silence until Bower spoke again .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 8]: `` How do the boots go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 5]: `` Splendidly , thanks .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 13]: It was exceedingly kind of you to take such trouble about them .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 25]: I had no idea one had to wear such heavy nails , and that tip of yours about the extra stockings is excellent . ''
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 11]: `` You will acknowledge the benefit most during the descent .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 22]: I have known people become absolutely lame on the home journey through wearing boots only just large enough for ordinary walking .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 21]: As for the clamping of the nails over the edges of the soles , the sharp stones render that imperative .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 43]: When you have crossed a moraine or two , and a peculiarly nasty _ geröll _ that exists beyond the hut , if we have time to make an easy ascent , you will understand the need of extra strong footwear . ''
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 8]: Helen favored him with a shy smile .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 30]: `` Long hours of reading have revealed the nature of a moraine , '' she said ; `` but , please , what is a _ geröll _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 7]: `` A slope of loose stones .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 14]: Let me see , what do they call it in Scotland and Cumberland ?
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 7]: Ah , yes , a scree .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 19]: On the French side of the Alps the same thing is known as a _ casse _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 11]: `` How well you know this country and its ways !
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 11]: Have you climbed many of the well known peaks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 13]: `` Some years ago I scored my century beyond twelve thousand feet .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 9]: That is pretty fair for an amateur . ''
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 8]: `` Have you done the Matterhorn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 6]: `` Yes , four times .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 20]: Once I followed Tyndall 's example , and converted the summit into a pass between Switzerland and Italy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 4]: `` How delightful !
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 12]: I suppose you have met many of the famous guides ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 4]: He laughed pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 27]: `` One does not attempt the Cervin or the Jungfrau without the best men , and in my time there were not twenty , all told .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 29]: I had a long talk with our present guide last night , and found I had used many a track he had only seen from the valley . ''
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 16]: `` Then -- '' A loud toot on a cowhorn close at hand interrupted her .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 7]: The artist was a small boy .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 15]: He appeared to be waiting expectantly on a hillock for someone who came not .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 7]: `` Is that a signal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 38]: He is a _ gaumer _ , or cowherd , -- another word for your Alpine vocabulary , -- the burgher whose cattle he will drive to the pasture has probably arranged to meet him here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 10]: Bower was always an interesting and well informed companion .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 22]: Launched now into a congenial topic , he gave Helen a thoroughly entertaining lecture on the customs of a Swiss commune .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 47]: He pointed out the successive tiers of pastures , told her their names and seasons of use , and even hummed some verses of the cow songs , or _ Kuh-reihen _ , which the men sing to the cattle , addressing each animal by name .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 8]: An hour passed pleasantly in this manner .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 33]: Their guide , a man named Josef Barth , and the porter , who answered to `` Karl , '' awaited them at the milk chalet by the side of Lake Cavloccio .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 27]: Bower , evidently accustomed to the leadership of expeditions of this sort , tested their ice axes and examined the ropes slung to Barth 's rucksack .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 34]: `` The Forno is a glacier _ de luxe _ , '' he explained to Helen ; `` but it is always advisable to make sure that your appliances are in good order .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 46]: That _ pickel _ you are carrying was made by the best blacksmith in Grindelwald , and you can depend on its soundness ; but these men are so familiar with their surroundings that they often provide themselves with frayed ropes and damaged axes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 26]: `` In addition to my boots , therefore , I am indebted to you for a special brand of ice ax , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 24]: `` Your gratitude now is as nothing to the ecstasy you will display when Karl unpacks his load , '' he answered lightly .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 11]: `` Now , Miss Wynton , _ en route _ !
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 14]: You know the path to the glacier already , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 10]: `` I have been to its foot twice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 7]: `` Then you go in front .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 9]: There is no room to walk two abreast .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 14]: Before we tackle the ice we will call a halt for refreshments . ''
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 14]: From that point till the glacier was reached the climb was laboriously simple .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 36]: There was no difficulty and not the slightest risk , even for a child ; but the heavy gradient and the rarefied air made it almost impossible to sustain a conversation unless the speakers dawdled .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 12]: Helen often found herself many yards in advance of the others .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 13]: She simply could not help breasting the steeper portions of the track .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 17]: She was drawn forward by an intense eagerness to begin the real business of the day .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 8]: Bower did not seek to restrain her .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 34]: He thought her high spirits admirable , and his gaze dwelt appreciatively on her graceful poise as she stopped on the crest of some small ravine and looked back at the plodders beneath .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 21]: Attractive at all times , she was bewitching that morning to a man who prided himself on his athletic tastes .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 27]: She wore a white knitted jersey and a short skirt , a costume seemingly devised to reveal the lines of a slender waist and supple limbs .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 62]: A white Tam o ' Shanter was tied firmly over her glossy brown hair with a silk motor veil , and the stout boots which she had surveyed so ruefully when Bower brought them to her on the previous evening after interviewing the village shoemaker , were by no means so cumbrous in use as her unaccustomed eyes had deemed them .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 32]: Even the phlegmatic guide was stirred to gruff appreciation when he saw her vault on to a large flat boulder in order to examine an iron cross that surmounted it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 5]: _ Ach , Gott !
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 16]: _ '' he grunted , `` that Englishwoman is as surefooted as a chamois . ''
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 20]: But Helen had found a name and a date on a triangular strip of metal attached to the cross .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 10]: `` Why has this memorial been placed here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 11]: Bower appealed to Barth ; but he shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 4]: Karl gave details .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 10]: `` A man fell on the Cima del Largo .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 13]: They carried him here , and he died on that rock . ''
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 5]: `` Poor fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 10]: Some of the joyous light left Helen 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 41]: She had passed the cross before , and had regarded it as one of the votive offerings so common by the wayside in Catholic countries , knowing that in this part of Switzerland the Italian element predominated among the peasants .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 22]: `` We get a fine view of the Cima del Largo from the _ cabane _ , '' said Bower unconcernedly .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 15]: Helen picked a little blue flower that nestled at the base of the rock .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 9]: She pinned it to her jersey without comment .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 28]: Sometimes the callousness of a man was helpful , and the shadow of a bygone tragedy was out of keeping with the glow of this delightful valley .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 11]: The curving mass of the glacier was now clearly visible .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 14]: It looked like some marble staircase meant to be trodden only by immortals .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 25]: Ever broadening and ascending until it filled the whole width of the rift between the hills , it seemed to mount upward to infinity .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 38]: The sidelong rays of the sun , peeping over the shoulders of Forno and Roseg , tinted the great ice river with a sapphire blue , while its higher reaches glistened as though studded with gigantic diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 20]: Near at hand , where the Orlegna rushed noisily from thraldom , the broken surface was somber and repellent .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 51]: In color a dull gray , owing to the accumulation of winter débris and summer dust , it had the aspect of decay and death ; it was jagged and gaunt and haggard ; the far flung piles of the white moraine imposed a stony barrier against its farther progress .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 23]: But that unpleasing glimpse of disruption was quickly dispelled by the magnificent volume and virgin purity of the glacier as a whole .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 20]: Helen tried to imagine herself two miles distant , a tiny speck on the great floor of the pass .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 41]: That was the only way to grasp its stupendous size , though she knew that it mounted through five miles of rock strewn ravine before it touched the precipitous saddle along which runs the border line between Italy and Switzerland .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 24]: Karl 's sigh of relief as he deposited his heavy load on a tablelike boulder brought Helen back from the land of dreams .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 41]: To this sturdy peasant the wondrous Forno merely represented a day 's hard work , at an agreed sum of ten francs for carrying nearly half a hundredweight , and a liberal _ pour-boire _ if the voyageurs were satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 41]: Sandwiches and a glass of wine , diluted with water brought by the guide from a neighboring rill , -- glacier water being used only as a last resource , -- were delectable after a steady two hours ' walk .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 34]: The early morning meal of coffee and a roll had lost some of its flavor when consumed apparently in the middle of the night , and Helen was ready now for her breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 26]: While they were eating , Bower and Josef Barth cast glances at some wisps of cloud drifting slowly over the crests of the southern hills .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 4]: Nothing was said .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 9]: The guide read his patron 's wishes correctly .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 21]: Unless some cause far more imperative than a slight mist intervened , the day 's programme must not be abandoned .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 6]: So there was no loitering .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 25]: The sun was almost in the valley , and the glacier must be crossed before the work of the night 's frost was undone .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 26]: When they stepped from the moraine on to the ice Barth led , Helen followed , Bower came next , with Karl in the rear .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 52]: If it had not been for the crisp crunching sound of the hobnails amid the loose fragments on the surface , and the ring of the _ pickel 's _ steel-shod butt on the solid mass beneath , Helen might have fancied that she was walking up an easy rock-covered slope .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 27]: Any delusion on that point , however , was promptly dispelled by a glimpse of a narrow crevasse that split the foot of the glacier lengthwise .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 8]: She peered into its sea-green depths awesomely .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 25]: It resembled a toothless mouth gaping slowly open , ready enough to swallow her , but too inert to put forth the necessary effort .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 8]: And the thought reminded her of something .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 7]: She halted and turned to Bower .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 9]: `` Ought we not to be roped ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 12]: He laughed , with the quiet confidence of the expert mountaineer .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 6]: `` The way is clear .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 14]: One does not walk into a crevasse with one 's eyes open . ''
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 23]: `` But Stampa told me that I should refuse to advance a yard on ice or difficult rock without being roped . ''
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 8]: `` Stampa , your cab driver ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 22]: There was no reason that she could fathom why her elderly friend 's name should be repeated with such scornful emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 5]: `` Ah , yes .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 12]: He is that because he is lame , '' she protested .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 16]: `` But he was one of the most famous guides in Zermatt years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 23]: She swung round and appealed to Barth , who was wondering why his employers were stopping before they had climbed twenty feet .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 7]: `` Are you from Zermatt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 3]: she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 10]: `` No , _ fräulein _ -- from Pontresina .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 9]: Zermatt is a long way from here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 13]: `` But you know some of the Zermatt men , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 9]: Have you ever heard of Christian Stampa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 8]: `` Most certainly , _ fräulein _ .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 15]: My father helped him to build the first hut on the Hörnli Ridge . ''
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 5]: `` Old Stampa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 6]: chimed in Karl from beneath .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 10]: `` It will be long ere he is forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 19]: I was one of four who carried him down from Corvatsch to Sils-Maria the day after he fell .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 27]: He was making the descent by night , -- a mad thing to do , -- and there was murder in his heart , they said .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 6]: But I never believed it .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 30]: We shared a bottle of Monte Pulciano only yesterday , just for the sake of old times , and he was as merry as Hans von Rippach himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 12]: Bower was stooping , so Helen could not see his face .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 10]: He seemed to be fumbling with a boot lace .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 8]: `` You hear , Mr. Bower ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 9]: `` I am quoting no mean authority . ''
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 5]: He did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 10]: He had untied the lace and was readjusting it .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 20]: The girl realized that to a man of his portly build his present attitude was not conducive to speech .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 13]: It had an additional effect which did not suggest itself to her .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 22]: The effort thus demanded from heart and lungs might bring back the blood to a face blanched by a deadly fear .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 8]: Karl was stocked with reminiscences of Stampa .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 21]: `` I remember the time when people said Christian was the best man in the Bernina , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 14]: `` He would never go back to the Valais after his daughter died .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 21]: It was a strange thing that he should come to grief on a cowherd 's track like that over Corvatsch .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 10]: But Etta 's affair -- '' '' _ Schweige !
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 9]: _ '' snarled Bower , straightening himself suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 20]: His dark eyes shot such a gleam of lambent fury at the porter that the man 's jaw fell .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 8]: The words were frozen on his lips .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 29]: He could not have been stricken dumb more effectually had he come face to face with one of the horrific sprites described in the folklore of the hills .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 4]: Helen was surprised .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 17]: What had poor Karl done that he should be bidden so fiercely to hold his tongue ?
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 30]: Then she thought that Bower must have recalled Stampa 's history , and feared that perhaps the outspoken peasant might enter into a piquant account of some village scandal .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 24]: A chambermaid in the hotel , questioned about Stampa , had told her that the daughter he loved so greatly had committed suicide .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 18]: Really , she ought to be grateful to her companion for saving her from a passing embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 13]: But she had the tact not to drop the subject too quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 28]: `` If Barth and you agree that roping is unnecessary , of course I have n't a word to say in the matter , '' she volunteered .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 16]: `` It was rather absurd of me to mention it in the first instance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 7]: `` No , you were right .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 12]: I have never seen Stampa ; but his name is familiar .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 7]: It occurs in most Alpine records .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 10]: Barth , fix the rope before we go farther .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 8]: The _ fräulein _ wishes it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 33]: The rush of color induced by physical effort -- effort of a tensity that Helen was wholly unaware of -- was ebbing now before a numbing terror that had come to stay .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 7]: His face was drawn and livid .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 18]: His voice had the metallic ring in it that the girl had detected once already that day .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 17]: Again she experienced a sense of bewilderment that he should regard a trivial thing so seriously .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 6]: She was not a child .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 45]: The world of to-day pulsated with far too many stories of tragic passion that she should be shielded so determinedly from any hint of an episode that doubtless wrung the heart 's core of this quiet valley one day in August sixteen years ago .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 27]: In some slight degree Bower 's paroxysm of anger was a reflection on her own good taste , for she had unwittingly given rise to it .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 8]: Nevertheless , she felt indebted to him .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 24]: To extricate both Bower and herself from an awkward situation she took a keen interest in Barth 's method of adjusting the rope .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 12]: The man did not show any amazement at Bower 's order .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 8]: He was there to earn his fee .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 42]: Had these mad English told him to cut steps up the gentle slope in front he would have obeyed without protest , though it was more than strange that this much traveled _ voyageur _ should adopt such a needless precaution .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 25]: As a matter of fact , under Barth 's guidance , a blind cripple could have surmounted the first kilometer of the Forno glacier .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 12]: The track lay close to the left bank of the moraine .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 36]: It curved slightly to the right and soon the exquisite panorama of Monte Roseg , the Cima di Rosso , Monte Sissone , Piz Torrone , and the Castello group opened up before the climbers .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 4]: Helen was enchanted .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 31]: Twice she half turned to address some question to Bower ; but on each occasion she happened to catch him in the act of swallowing some brandy from a flask .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 46]: Governed by an unaccountable timidity , she pretended not to notice his actions , and diverted her words to Barth , who told her the names of the peaks and pointed to the junctions of minor ice fields with the main artery of the Forno .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 17]: Bower did not utter a syllable until they struck out toward the center of the glacier .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 32]: A crevasse some ten feet in width and seemingly hundreds of feet deep , barred the way ; but a bridge of ice , covered with snow , offered safe transit .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 17]: The snow carpet showed that a number of climbers had passed quite recently in both directions .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 41]: Even Helen , somewhat awed by the dimensions of the rift , understood that the existence of this natural arch was as well recognized by Alpinists as Waterloo Bridge is known to dwellers on the south side of the Thames .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 18]: `` Now , Miss Wynton , you should experience your first real thrill , '' said Bower .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 19]: `` This bridge forms here every year at this season , and an army might cross in safety .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 14]: It is the genuine article , the first and strongest of a series .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 7]: Yet here you cross the Rubicon .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 14]: A mixture of metaphors is allowable in high altitudes , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 25]: Helen , almost startled at first by the unaffected naturalness of his words , was unfeignedly relieved at finding him restored to the normal .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 9]: Usually his supply of light-hearted badinage was unceasing .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 14]: He knew exactly when and how to season it with more serious statements .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 18]: It is this rare quality that makes tolerable a long day 's solitude _ à deux _ .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 10]: -LSB- Illustration : She flourished her ice axe bravely .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 40]: _ Page 163 _ -RSB- `` I am not Cæsar 's wife , '' she replied ; `` but for the credit of womankind in general I shall act as though I was above suspicion -- of nervousness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 6]: She did not look round .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 20]: Barth was moving quickly , and she had no desire to burden him with a drag on the rope .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 37]: When she was in the center of the narrow causeway , a snow cornice in the lip of the crevasse detached itself under the growing heat of the sun and shivered down into the green darkness .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 9]: The incident brought her heart into her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 21]: It served as a reminder that this solid ice river was really in a state of constant change and movement .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 11]: Bower laughed , with all his customary gayety of manner .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 12]: `` That came at a dramatic moment , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 16]: `` Too bad it could not let you pass without giving you a quake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 9]: `` I am not a bit afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 10]: `` Ah , but I can read your thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 10]: There is a bond of sympathy between us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 7]: `` Hemp is a non-conductor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 11]: `` You are willfully misunderstanding me , '' he retorted .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 12]: I honestly believed you felt the rope quiver a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 3]: `` Alas !
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 5]: it is the atmosphere .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 8]: My compliments fall on idle ears . ''
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 15]: Barth interrupted this play of harmless chaff by jerking some remark over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 13]: `` Looks like a _ guxe _ , '' he said gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 4]: `` Nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 10]: said Bower , -- `` a bank of mist .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 8]: The sun will soon melt it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 24]: `` It 's a _ guxe _ , right enough , '' chimed in Karl , who had recovered his power of speech .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 21]: `` That is why the boy was blowing his horn -- to show he was bringing the cattle home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 8]: `` Well , then , push on .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 11]: The sooner we are in the hut the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 11]: `` Please , what is a _ guxe _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 12]: asked Helen , when the men had nothing more to say .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 16]: `` A word I would have wished to add later to your Alpine phrase book .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 9]: It means a storm , a blizzard . ''
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 12]: `` Should we not return at once in that event ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 3]: `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 10]: Who said just now she was not afraid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 10]: `` But a storm in such a place ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 16]: `` These fellows smell a _ tourmente _ in every little cloud from the southwest .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 19]: We may have some wind and a light snowfall , and that will be an experience for you .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 13]: Surely you can trust me not to run any real risk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 5]: I do , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 16]: But I have read of people being caught in these storms and suffering terribly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 10]: `` Not on the Forno , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 27]: I do n't wish to minimize the perils of your first ascent ; but it is only fair to say that this is an exhibition glacier .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 22]: If it was nearer town you would find an orchestra in each amphitheater up there , with sideshows in every couloir .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 24]: Jesting apart , you are absolutely safe with Barth and me , not to mention the irrepressible gentleman who carries our provisions . ''
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 30]: Helen was fully alive to the fact that a woman who joins a mountaineering party should not impose her personal doubts on men who are willing to go on .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 14]: She flourished her ice ax bravely , and cried , `` Excelsior ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 11]: In the next instant she regretted her choice of expression .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 20]: The moral of Longfellow 's poem might be admirable , but the fate of its hero was unpleasantly topical .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 4]: Again Bower laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 17]: `` Will you deny now that I am a first rate receiver of wireless messages ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 9]: She had no breath left for a quip .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 15]: Barth was hurrying , and the thin air was beginning to have its effect .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 30]: When an unusually smooth stretch of ice permitted her to take her eyes from the track for a moment she looked back to learn the cause of such haste .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 20]: To her complete astonishment , the Maloja Pass and the hills beyond it were dissolved in a thick mist .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 10]: A monstrous cloud was sweeping up the Orlegna Valley .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 52]: As yet , it was making for the Muretto Pass rather than the actual ravine of the Forno ; but a few wraiths of vapor were sailing high overhead , and it needed no weatherwise native to predict that ere long the glacier itself would be covered by that white pall .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 5]: She glanced at Bower .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 4]: He smiled cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 9]: `` It is nothing , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 11]: `` I really do n't care , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 13]: `` One does not shirk an adventure merely because it is disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 12]: The pity is that all this lovely sunshine must vanish . ''
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 5]: `` It will reappear .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 14]: You will be charmed with the novelty in an hour or less . ''
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 9]: `` Is it far to the hut ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 10]: `` Hardly twenty minutes at our present pace . ''
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 9]: A growl from Barth stopped their brief talk .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 7]: Another huge crevasse yawned in front .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 40]: There was an ice bridge , with snow , like others they had crossed ; but this was a slender structure , and the leader stabbed it viciously with the butt of his ax before he ventured on it .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 12]: The others kept the rope taut , and he crossed safely .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 3]: They followed .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 17]: As Helen gained the further side she heard Bower 's chuckle : `` Another thrill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 13]: `` I am growing quite used to them , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 34]: `` Well , it may help somewhat if I tell you that the temporary departure of the sun will cause this particular bridge to be ten times as strong when we return . ''
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 4]: `` Attention ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 11]: cried Barth , taking a sharp turn to the left .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 9]: The meaning of his warning was soon apparent .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 32]: They had to descend a few feet of rough ice , and Helen found , to her great relief it must be confessed , that they were approaching the lateral moraine .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 6]: Already the sky was overcast .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 13]: The glacier had taken to itself a cold grayness that was disconcerting .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 10]: The heavy mist fell on them with inconceivable rapidity .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 16]: Shining peaks and towering precipices of naked rock were swept out of sight each instant .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 9]: The weather had changed with a magical speed .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 41]: The mist advanced with the rush of an express train , and a strong wind sprang up as though it had burst through a restraining wall and was bent on overwhelming the daring mortals who were penetrating its chosen territory .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 8]: Somehow -- anyhow -- Helen scrambled on .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 13]: She was obliged to keep eyes and mind intent on each step .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 25]: Her chief object was to imitate Barth , to poise , and jump , and clamber with feet and hands exactly as he did .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 34]: At this stage the rope was obviously a hindrance ; but none of the men suggested its removal , and Helen had enough to occupy her wits without troubling them by a question .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 25]: Even in the stress of her own breathless exertions she had room in her mind for a wondering pity for the heavily laden Karl .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 22]: She marveled that anyone , be he strong as Samson , could carry such a load and not fall under it .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 19]: Yet he was lumbering along behind Bower with a clumsy agility that was almost supernatural to her thinking .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 29]: She was still unconscious of the fact that most of her own struggles were due more to the rarefied air than to the real difficulties of the route .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 82]: At last , when she really thought she must cry out for a rest , when a steeper climb than any hitherto encountered had bereft her almost of the power to take another upward spring to the ledge of some enormous boulder , when her knees and ankles were sore and bruised , and the skin of her fingers was beginning to fray under her stout gloves , she found herself standing on a comparatively level space formed of broken stones .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 19]: A rough wall , surmounted by a flat pitched roof , stared at her out of the mist .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 17]: In the center of the wall a small , square , shuttered window suggested a habitation .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 27]: Her head swam , and her eyes ached dreadfully ; but she knew that this was the hut , and strove desperately to appear self possessed .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 17]: `` Accept my congratulations , Miss Wynton , '' said a low voice at her ear .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 18]: `` Not one woman in a thousand would have gone through that last half-hour without a murmur .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 7]: You are no longer a novice .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 12]: Allow me to present you with the freedom of the Alps .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 12]: This is one of the many châteaux at your disposal . ''
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 9]: A wild swirl of sleet lashed them venomously .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 15]: This first whip of the gale seemed to have the spitefulness of disappointed rage .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 6]: Helen felt her arm grasped .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 18]: Bower led her to a doorway cunningly disposed out of the path of the dreaded southwest wind .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 49]: At that instant all the woman in her recognized that the man was big , and strong , and self reliant , and that it was good to have him near , shouting reassuring words that were whirled across the rock-crowned glacier by the violence of the tempest .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 41]: CHAPTER IX `` ETTA 'S FATHER '' Though the hut was a crude thing , a triumph of essentials over luxuries , Helen had never before hailed four walls and a roof with such heartfelt , if silent , thanksgiving .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 23]: She sank exhausted on a rough bench , and watched the matter-of-fact Engadiners unpacking the stores and firewood carried in their rucksacks .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 9]: Their businesslike air supplied the tonic she needed .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 29]: Though the howling storm seemed to threaten the tiny refuge with destruction , these two men set to work , coolly and methodically , to prepare a meal .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 37]: Barth arranged the contents of Karl 's bulky package on a small table , and the porter busied himself with lighting a fire in a Swiss stove that stood in the center of the outer room .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 12]: An inner apartment loomed black and uninviting through an open doorway .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 43]: Helen discovered later that some scanty accommodation was provided there for those who meant to sleep in the hut in readiness for an early ascent , while it supplied a separate room in the event of women taking part in an expedition .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 10]: Bower offered her a quantity of brandy and water .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 15]: She declined it , declaring that she needed only time to regain her breath .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 19]: He was a man who might be trusted not to pester anyone with well meant but useless attentions .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 36]: He went to the door , lit a cigarette , and seemed to be keenly interested in the sleet as it pelted the moraine or gathered in drifts in the minor fissures of the glacier .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 17]: Within a remarkably short space of time , Karl had concocted two cups of steaming coffee .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 6]: Helen was then all aglow .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 5]: Her strength was restored .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 11]: The boisterous wind had crimsoned her cheeks beneath the tan .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 18]: She had never looked such a picture of radiant womanhood as after this tussle with the storm .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 25]: Luckily her clothing was not wet , since the travelers reached the _ cabane _ at the very instant the elements became really aggressive .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 19]: It was a quite composed and reinvigorated Helen who summoned Bower from his contemplation of the weather portents .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 22]: `` We may be besieged , '' she cried ; `` but at any rate we are not on famine rations .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 4]: What a spread !
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 19]: You could hardly have brought more food if you fancied we might be kept here a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 22]: The sustained physical effort called for during the last part of the climb seemed to have dispelled his fit of abstraction .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 12]: Being an eminently adaptable man , he responded to her mood .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 40]: `` Ah , that sounds more like the enthusiast who set forth so gayly from the Kursaal this morning , '' he answered , pulling the door ajar before he took a seat by her side on the bench .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 28]: `` A few minutes ago you were ready to condemn me as several kinds of idiot for going on in the teeth of our Switzers ' warnings .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 5]: Now , confess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 17]: `` I do n't think I could have climbed another ten yards , '' she admitted .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 10]: `` Our haste was due to Barth 's anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 9]: He wanted to save you from a drenching .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 24]: It was a near thing , and with the thermometer falling a degree a minute soaked garments might have brought very unpleasant consequences .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 7]: But that was our only risk .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 21]: Old mountaineer as I am , I hardly expected such a blizzard in August , after such short notice too .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 18]: Otherwise , now that we are safely housed , you are fortunate in securing a memorable experience .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 18]: The storm will soon blow over ; but it promises to be lively while it lasts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 6]: Helen was sipping her coffee .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 12]: Perhaps her eyes conveyed the question her tongue hesitated to utter .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 25]: Bower smiled pleasantly , and gesticulated with hands and shoulders in a way that was foreign to his studiously cultivated English habit of repose .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 16]: Indeed , with his climber 's garb he seemed to have acquired a new manner .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 11]: There was a perplexing change in him since the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 5]: `` I understand perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 14]: You and I might sing _ lieder ohne worte _ , Miss Wynton .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 42]: I have known these summer gales to last four days ; but pray do not be alarmed , '' for Helen nearly dropped her cup in quick dismay ; `` my own opinion is that we shall have a delightful afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 9]: Of course , I am a discredited prophet .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 4]: Ask Barth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 39]: The guide , hearing his name mentioned , glanced at them , though he was engaged at the moment in taking the wrappings off a quantity of bread , cold chicken , and slices of ham and beef .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 5]: He agreed with Bower .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 10]: The barometer stood high when they left the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 26]: He thought , as all men think who live in the open , that `` the sharper the blast the sooner it 's past . ''
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 35]: `` Moreover , '' broke in Karl , who refused to be left out of the conversation , `` Johann Klucker 's cat was sitting with its back to the stove last evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 17]: This bit of homely philosophy brought a ripple of laughter from Helen , whereupon Karl explained .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 10]: `` Cats are very wise , _ fräulein _ .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 7]: Johann Klucker 's cat is old .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 12]: Therefore she is skilled in reading the tokens of the weather .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 13]: A cat hates wind and rain , and makes her arrangements accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 14]: If she washes herself smoothly , the next twelve hours will be fine .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 12]: If she licks against the grain , it will be wet .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 17]: When she lies with her back to the fire , there will surely be a squall .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 16]: When her tail is up and her coat rises , look out for wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 17]: `` Johann Klucker 's cat has settled the dispute , '' said Bower gravely in English .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 30]: `` A squall it is , -- a most suitable prediction for a cat , -- and I am once more rehabilitated in your esteem , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 12]: A cold iridescence suddenly illumined the gloomy interior of the hut .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 13]: It gave individuality to each particle of sleet whirling past the door .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 28]: Helen thought that the sun had broken through the storm clouds for an instant ; but Bower said quietly : `` Are you afraid of lightning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 4]: `` Not very .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 7]: I do n't like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 10]: `` Some people collapse altogether when they see it .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 8]: Perhaps when forewarned you are forearmed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 17]: A low rumble boomed up the valley , and the mountain echoes muttered in solemn chorus .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 15]: `` We are to be spared none of the scenic accessories , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 3]: said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 3]: `` None .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 19]: In fact , you will soon see and hear a thunder storm that would have delighted Gustave Doré .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 23]: Please remember that it can not last long , and that this hut has been built twenty years to my knowledge . ''
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 16]: Helen sipped her coffee , but pushed away a plate set before her by Barth .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 19]: `` If you do n't mind , I should like the door wide open , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 8]: `` You prefer to lunch later ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 14]: `` And you wish to face the music -- is that it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 6]: `` I think so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 17]: `` Let me remind you that Jove 's thunderbolts are really forged on the hilltops . ''
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 14]: `` I am here ; so I must make the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 16]: I shall not scream , or faint , if that is what you dread . ''
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 18]: `` I dread nothing but your anger for not having turned back when a retreat was possible .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 8]: I hate turning back , Miss Wynton .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 26]: I have never yet withdrawn from any enterprise seriously undertaken , and I was determined to share your first ramble among my beloved hills . ''
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 23]: Another gleam of light , bluer and more penetrating than its forerunner , lit the brown rafters of the _ cabane _ .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 13]: It was succeeded by a crash like the roar of massed artillery .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 4]: The walls trembled .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 10]: Some particles of mortar rattled noisily to the floor .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 19]: A strange sound of rending , followed by a heavy thud , suggested something more tangible than thunderbolts .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 9]: Bower kicked the door and it swung inward .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 8]: `` An avalanche , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 6]: `` Probably a rockfall too .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 18]: Of course , the hut stands clear of the track of unpleasant visitors of that description . ''
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 16]: Helen had not expected this courageous bearing in a man of Bower 's physical characteristics .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 22]: Hitherto she had regarded him as somewhat self indulgent , a Sybarite , the product of modernity in its London aspects .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 30]: His demeanor in the train , in the hotel , bespoke one accustomed to gratify the flesh , who found all the world ready to pander to his desires .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 17]: Again she was conscious of that instinctive trustfulness a woman freely reposes in a dominant man .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 12]: Oddly enough , she thought of Spencer in the same breath .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 29]: An hour earlier , had she been asked which of these two would command her confidence during a storm , her unhesitating choice would have favored the American .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 15]: Now , she was at least sure that Bower 's coolness was not assumed .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 5]: His attitude inspired emulation .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 8]: She rose and went to the door .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 12]: `` I want to see an avalanche , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 8]: `` Where did that one fall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 4]: Bower followed her .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 6]: He spoke over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 8]: `` On Monte Roseg , I expect .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 8]: The weather seems to be clearing slightly .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 23]: This tearing wind will soon roll up the mist , and the thunder will certainly start another big rock or a snowslide .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 13]: If you are lucky , you may witness something really fine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 8]: A dazzling flash leaped over the glacier .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 26]: Although the surrounding peaks were as yet invisible through the haze of sleet and vapor , objects near at hand were revealed with uncanny distinctness .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 15]: Each frozen wave on the surface of the ice was etched in sharp lines .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 14]: A cluster of séracs on a neighboring icefall showed all their mad chaos .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 26]: The blue green chasm of a huge crevasse was illumined to a depth far below any point to which the rays of the sun penetrated .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 25]: On the neighboring slope of Monte Roseg the crimson and green and yellow mosses were given sudden life against the black background of rock .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 8]: Every boulder here wore a somber robe .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 6]: They were stark and grim .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 23]: The eye instantly caught the contrast to their gray-white fellows piled on the lower moraine or in the bed of the Orlegna .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 18]: Helen was quick to note the new tone of black amid the vividly white patches of snow .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 14]: She waited until the deafening thunder peal was dying away in eerie cadences .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 15]: `` Why are the rocks black here and almost white in the valley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 16]: `` Because they are young , as rocks go , '' was the smiling answer .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 10]: `` They have yet to pass through the mill .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 24]: They will be battered and bruised and polished before they emerge from the glacier several years hence and a few miles nearer peace .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 6]: In that they resemble men .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 34]: ` Pon my word , Miss Wynton , you have caused me to evolve a rather poetic explanation of certain gray hairs I have noticed of late among my own raven locks . ''
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 37]: `` You appear to know and love these hills so well that I wonder -- if you will excuse a personal remark -- I wonder you ever were able to tear yourself away from them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 21]: `` I have missed too much of real enjoyment in the effort to amass riches , '' he said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 23]: `` Believe me , that thought has held me since -- since you and I set foot on the Forno together . ''
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 5]: `` But you knew ?
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 8]: You were no stranger to the Alps ?
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 27]: I am beginning to understand that one can not claim kinship with the high places until they stir the heart more in storm than in sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 25]: When I saw all these giants glittering in the sun like knights in silver armor , I described them to myself as gloriously beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 40]: Now I feel that they are more than that , -- they are awful , pitiless in their indifference to frail mortals ; they carry me into a dim region where life and death are terms without meaning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 12]: `` Yes , that is the true spirit of the mountains .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 18]: I too used to look on them with affectionate reverence , and you recall the old days .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 18]: Perhaps , if I am deemed worthy , you will teach me the cult once more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 4]: He bent closer .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 12]: Helen became conscious that in her enthusiasm she had spoken unguardedly .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 34]: She moved away , slightly but unmistakably , a step or two out into the open , for the hut on that side was not exposed to the bitter violence of the wind .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 17]: `` It is absurd to imagine us in a change of rôle , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 13]: `` I should play the poorest travesty of Mentor to your Telemachus .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 5]: What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 21]: While she was speaking , another blinding flare of lightning flooded moraine and glacier and pierced the veil of sleet .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 8]: Her voice rose almost to a shriek .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 4]: Bower sprang forward .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 9]: His left hand rested reassuringly across her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 11]: `` Better come inside the hut , '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 17]: `` But I saw someone -- a white face -- staring at me down there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 5]: `` It is possible .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 7]: There is no cause for fear .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 8]: A party may have crossed from Italy .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 12]: There would be none from the Maloja at this hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 5]: Helen was actually trembling .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 7]: Bower drew her a little nearer .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 22]: He himself was unnerved , a prey to wilder emotions than she could guess till later days brought a fuller understanding .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 39]: It was a mad trick of fate that threw the girl into his embrace just then , for another far-flung sheet of fire revealed to her terrified vision the figures of Spencer and Stampa on the rocks beneath .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 14]: With brutal candor , the same flash showed her nestling close to Bower .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 7]: For some reason , she shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 20]: Though the merciful gloom of the next few seconds restored her faculties , her face and neck were aflame .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 12]: She almost felt that she had been detected in some fault .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 14]: Her confusion was not lessened by hearing a muttered curse from her companion .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 35]: Careless of the stinging sleet , she leaped down to a broad tier of rock below the plateau of the hut and cried shrilly : `` Is that really you , Mr. Spencer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 19]: A more tremendous burst of thunder than any yet experienced dwarfed all other sounds for an appreciable time .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 15]: The American scrambled up , almost at her feet , and stood beside her .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 21]: Stampa came quick on his heels , moving with a lightness and accuracy of foothold amazing in one so lame .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 7]: `` Just me , Miss Wynton .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 19]: Sorry if I have frightened you , but our old friend here was insistent that we should hurry .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 10]: I have been tracking you since nine o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 7]: Spencer 's words were nonchalantly polite .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 24]: He even raised his cap , though the fury of the ice laden blast might well have excused this formal act of courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 21]: Helen was still blushing so painfully that she became angry with herself , and her voice was hardly under control .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 15]: Nevertheless , she managed to say : `` How kind and thoughtful of you !
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 9]: I am all right , as you see .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 16]: Mr. Bower and the guide were able to bring me here before the storm broke .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 13]: We happened to be standing near the door , watching the lightning .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 25]: When I caught a glimpse of you I was so stupidly startled that I screamed and almost fell into Mr. Bower 's arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 12]: Put in that way , it did not sound so distressing .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 15]: And Spencer had no desire to add further difficulties to a situation already awkward .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 11]: `` Guess you scared me too , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 29]: `` I suppose , now we are at the hut , Stampa will not object to my waiting five minutes or so before we start for home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 8]: `` Surely you will lunch with us .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 18]: Everything is set out on the table , and we have food enough for a regiment . ''
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 17]: `` You would need it if you remained here another couple of hours , Miss Wynton .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 25]: Stampa tells me that a first rate _ guxe _ , which is Swiss for a blizzard , I believe , is blowing up .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 13]: This thunder storm is the preliminary to a heavy downfall of snow .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 6]: That is why I came .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 24]: If we are not off the glacier before two o'clock , it will become impassable till a lot of the snow melts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 9]: `` What is that you are saying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 4]: demanded Bower bruskly .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 51]: Helen and the two men had reached the level of the _ cabane _ ; but Stampa , thinking they would all enter , kept in the rear , `` If that fairy tale accounts for your errand , you are on a wild goose chase , Mr. Spencer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 36]: He had not heard the American 's words clearly ; but he gathered sufficient to account for the younger man 's motive in following them , and was furiously annoyed by this unlooked for interruption .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 11]: He had no syllable of thanks for a friendly action .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 29]: Though no small risk attended the crossing of the Forno during a gale , it was evident he strongly resented the presence of both Spencer and the guide .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 12]: Helen , after her first eager outburst , was tongue tied .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 37]: She saw that her would-be rescuers were dripping wet , and was amazed that Bower should greet them so curtly , though , to be sure , she believed implicitly that the storm would soon pass .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 7]: Stampa was already inside the hut .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 18]: He was haranguing Barth and the porter vehemently , and they were listening with a curious submissiveness .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 8]: Spencer was the most collected person present .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 17]: He brushed aside Bower 's acrimony as lightly as he had accepted Helen 's embarrassed explanation .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 13]: `` This is not my hustle at all , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 14]: `` Stampa heard that his adored _ sigñorina _ -- '' `` Stampa !
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 5]: Is that Stampa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 11]: Bower 's strident voice was hushed to a hoarse murmur .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 15]: It reminded one of his hearers of a growling dog suddenly cowed by fear .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 22]: Helen 's ears were tuned to this perplexing note ; but Spencer interpreted it according to his dislike of the man .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 23]: `` Stampa heard , '' he went on , with cold-drawn precision , `` that Miss Wynton had gone to the Forno .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 42]: He is by far the most experienced guide to be found on this side of the Alps , and he believes that anyone remaining up here to-day will surely be imprisoned in the hut a week or more by bad weather .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 17]: In fact , even now an hour may make all the difference between danger and safety .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 9]: Perhaps you can convince him he is wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 21]: I know nothing about it , beyond the evidence of my senses , backed up by some acquaintance with blizzards .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 27]: Anyhow , I am inclined to think that Miss Wynton will be wise if she listens to the points of the argument in the hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 16]: `` Perhaps it would be better to return at once , '' said Helen timidly .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 32]: Her sensitive nature warned her that these two men were ready to quarrel , and that she herself , in some nebulous way , was the cause of their mutual enmity .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 8]: Beyond this her intuition could not travel .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 17]: It was impossible that she should realize how sorely her wish to placate Bower disquieted Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 45]: He had seen the two under conditions that might , indeed , be explicable by Helen 's fright ; but he would extend no such charitable consideration to Bower , whose conduct , no matter how it was viewed , made him a rival .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 8]: Yes , it had come to that .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 15]: Spencer had hardly spoken a word to Stampa during the toilsome journey from Maloja .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 23]: He had looked facts stubbornly in the face , and the looking served to clear certain doubts from his heart and brain .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 11]: He wanted to woo and win Helen for his wife .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 21]: He was enmeshed in a net of his own contriving , and its strands were too strong to be broken .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 20]: If Helen was reft from him now , he would gaze on a darkened world for many a day .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 10]: But he was endowed with a splendid self control .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 25]: That element of cast steel in his composition , discovered by Dunston after five minutes ' acquaintance , kept him rigid under the strain .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 47]: `` Sorry I should figure as spoiling your excursion , Miss Wynton , '' he was able to say calmly ; `` but , when all is said and done , the weather is bad , and you will have plenty of fine days later . ''
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 4]: Bower crept nearer .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 5]: His action suggested stealth .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 17]: Although the wind was howling under the deep eaves of the hut , he almost whispered .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 10]: `` Yes , you are right -- quite right .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 8]: Let us go now -- at once .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 20]: With you and me , Mr. Spencer , Miss Wynton will be safe -- safer than with the guides .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 7]: They can follow with the stores .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 9]: There is no time to be lost ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 20]: The others were so taken aback by his astounding change of front that they were silent for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 9]: It was Helen who protested , firmly enough .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 17]: `` The lightning seems to have given us an attack of nerves , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 25]: `` It would be ridiculous to rush off in that manner -- '' `` But there is peril -- real peril -- in delay .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 4]: I admit it .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 5]: I was wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 8]: Bower 's anxiety was only too evident .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 22]: Spencer , regarding him from a single viewpoint , deemed him a coward , and his gorge rose at the thought .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 6]: `` Oh , nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 4]: he cried contemptuously .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 20]: `` We shall be two hours on the glacier , so five more minutes wo n't cut any ice .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 14]: If you have food and drink in there , Stampa certainly wants both .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 5]: We all need them .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 10]: We have to meet that gale all the way .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 13]: The two hours may become three before we reach the path . ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 8]: Helen guessed the reason of his disdain .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 18]: It was unjust ; but the moment did not permit of a hint that he was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 29]: To save Bower from further commitment -- which , she was convinced , was due entirely to regard for her own safety -- she went into the hut .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 21]: `` Stampa , '' she said , `` I am very much obliged to you for taking so much trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 11]: I suppose we may eat something before we start ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 11]: `` Assuredly , _ fräulein _ , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 6]: `` Am I not here ?
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 20]: Were it to begin to snow at once , I could still bring you unharmed to the chalets . ''
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 32]: Josef Barth had borne Stampa 's reproaches with surly deference ; but he refused to be degraded in this fashion -- before Karl , too , whose tongue wagged so loosely .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 20]: `` That is the talk of a foolish boy , not of a man , '' he cried wrathfully .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 18]: `` Am I not fitted , then , to take mademoiselle home after bringing her here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 16]: `` Truly , on a fine day , Josef , '' was the smiling answer .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 26]: `` I told monsieur that a _ guxe _ was blowing up from the south ; so did Karl ; but he would not hearken .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 4]: _ Ma foi !
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 8]: _ I am not to blame . ''
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 19]: Barth , on his dignity , introduced a few words of French picked up from the Chamounix men .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 17]: He fancied they would awe Stampa , and prove incidentally how wide was his own experience .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 6]: The old guide only laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 13]: `` A nice pair , you and Karl , '' he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 10]: `` Are the voyageurs in your care or not ?
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 6]: You told monsieur , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 9]: You ought to have refused to take mademoiselle .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 11]: That would have settled the affair , I fancy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 15]: `` But this monsieur knows as much about the mountains as any of us .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 8]: He might surprise even you , Stampa .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 10]: He has climbed the Matterhorn from Zermatt and Breuil .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 13]: He has come down the rock wall on the Col des Nantillons .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 18]: How is one to argue with such a _ voyageur _ on this child 's glacier ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 3]: Stampa whistled .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 10]: `` Oh -- knows the Matterhorn , does he ?
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 6]: What is his name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 14]: `` Bower , '' said Helen , -- `` Mr. Mark Bower . ''
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 8]: Say that again , _ fräulein _ !
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 3]: Mark Bower ?
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 10]: Is that your English way of putting it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 18]: Helen attributed Stampa 's low hiss to a tardy recognition of Bower 's fame as a mountaineer .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 11]: Though the hour was noon , the light was feeble .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 26]: Veritable thunder clouds had gathered above the mist , and the expression of Stampa 's face was almost hidden in the obscurity of the hut .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 10]: `` That is his name , '' she repeated .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 8]: `` You must have heard of him .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 13]: He was well known on the high Alps -- years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 9]: She paused before she added those concluding words .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 42]: She was about to say `` in your time , '' but the substituted phrase was less personal , since the circumstances under which Stampa ceased to be a notability in `` the street '' at Zermatt were in her mind .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 6]: `` God in heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 24]: muttered the old man , passing a hand over his face as though waking from a dream , -- `` God in heaven !
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 12]: can it be that my prayer is answered at last ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 4]: He shambled out .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 16]: Spencer had waited to watch the almost continuous blaze of lightning playing on the glacier .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 12]: Distant summits were now looming through the diminishing downpour of sleet .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 12]: He was wondering if by any chance Stampa might be mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 13]: Bower stood somewhat apart , seemingly engaged in the same engrossing task .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 13]: The wind was not quite so fierce as during its first onset .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 5]: It blew in gusts .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 14]: No longer screaming in a shrill and sustained note , it wailed fitfully .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 7]: Stampa lurched unevenly close to Bower .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 19]: He was about to touch him on the shoulder ; but he appeared to recollect himself in time .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 19]: `` Marcus Bauer , '' he said in a voice that was terrible by reason of its restraint .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 4]: Bower wheeled suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 5]: He did not flinch .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 7]: His manner suggested a certain preparedness .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 21]: Thus might a strong man face a wild beast when hope lay only in the matching of sinew against sinew .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 12]: `` That is not my name , '' he snarled viciously .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 21]: `` Marcus Bauer , '' repeated Stampa in the same repressed monotone , `` I am Etta 's father . ''
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 10]: `` Why do you address me in that fashion ?
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 8]: I have never before seen you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 6]: You took care of that .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 17]: You feared Etta 's father , though you cared little for Christian Stampa , the guide .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 9]: But I have seen you , Marcus Bauer .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 12]: You were slim then -- an elegant , is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 28]: -- and many a time have I hobbled into the Hotel Mont Cervin to look at your portrait in a group lest I should forget your face .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 7]: Yet I passed you just now !
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 3]: Great God !
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 5]: I passed you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 14]: A ferocity glared from Bower 's eyes that might well have daunted Stampa .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 29]: For an instant he glanced toward Spencer , whose clear cut profile was silhouetted against a background of white-blue ice now gleaming in a constant flutter of lightning .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 14]: Stampa was not yet aware of the true cause of Bower 's frenzy .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 11]: He thought that terror was spurring him to self defense .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 25]: An insane impulse to kill , to fight with the nails and teeth , almost mastered him ; but that must not be yet .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 28]: `` It is useless , Marcus Bauer , '' he said , with a calmness so horribly unreal that its deadly intent was all the more manifest .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 9]: `` I am the avenger , not you .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 13]: I can tear you to pieces with my hands when I will .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 25]: It would be here and now , were it not for the presence of the English _ sigñorina _ who saved me from death .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 11]: It is not meet that she should witness your expiation .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 12]: That is to be settled between you and me alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 9]: Bower made one last effort to assert himself .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 13]: `` You are talking in riddles , man , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 25]: `` If you believe you have some long forgotten grievance against one of my name , come and see me to-morrow at the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 12]: Perhaps -- '' `` Yes , I shall see you to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 9]: Do not dream that you can escape me .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 16]: Now that I know you live , I would search the wide world for you .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 3]: Blessed Mother !
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 11]: How you must have feared me all these years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 11]: Stampa was using the Romansch dialect of the Italian Alps .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 5]: Bower spoke in German .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 5]: Spencer heard them indistinctly .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 21]: He marveled that they should discuss , as he imagined , the state of the weather with such subdued passion .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 16]: `` Hello , Christian , '' he cried , `` the clouds are lifting somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 7]: Where is your promised snow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 22]: Stampa peered up into Bower 's face ; for his twisted leg had reduced his own unusual height by many inches .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 4]: `` To-morrow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 3]: he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 9]: `` At ten o'clock -- outside the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 6]: Then we have a settlement .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 5]: Is it so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 5]: There was no answer .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 20]: Bower was wrestling with a mad desire to grapple with him and fling him down among the black rocks .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 4]: Stampa crept nearer .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 22]: A ghastly smile lit his rugged features , and his _ pickel _ clattered to the broken shingle at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 10]: `` I offer you to-morrow , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 7]: `` I am in no hurry .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 7]: Have I not waited sixteen years ?
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 15]: But it may be that you are tortured by a devil , Marcus Bauer .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 6]: Shall it be now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 11]: The clean-souled peasant believed that the millionaire had a conscience .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 14]: Not yet did he understand that balked desire is stronger than any conscience .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 16]: It really seemed that nothing could withhold these two from mortal struggle then and there .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 14]: Spencer was regarding them curiously ; but they paid no heed to him .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 12]: Bower 's tongue was darting in and out between his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 8]: The red blood surged to his temples .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 5]: Stampa was still smiling .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 16]: His lips moved in the strangest prayer that ever came from a man 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 21]: He was actually thanking the Madonna -- mother of the great peacemaker -- for having brought his enemy within reach !
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 5]: `` Mr. Bower ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 13]: came Helen 's voice from the door of the _ cabane _ .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 8]: `` Why do n't you join us ?
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 6]: And you , Mr. Spencer ?
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 10]: Stampa , come here and eat at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 6]: `` To-morrow , at ten ?
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 4]: Or now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 6]: the old man whispered again .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 7]: `` To-morrow -- curse you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 5]: Stampa twisted himself round .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 14]: `` I am not hungry , _ fräulein _ , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 11]: `` I ate chocolate all the way up the glacier .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 6]: But do you be speedy .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 9]: We have lost too much time already . ''
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 14]: Bower brushed past , and the guide stooped to recover his ice ax .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 20]: Spencer , though troubled sufficiently by his own disturbing fantasies , did not fail to notice their peculiar behavior .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 9]: But he answered Helen with a pleasant disclaimer .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 11]: `` Christian kept his hoard a secret , Miss Wynton .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 11]: I too have lost my appetite , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 19]: `` Once we start we shall hardly be able to unpack the hamper again , '' said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 7]: The American was trying her temper .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 22]: She suspected that he carried his hostility to the absurd pitch of refusing to partake of any food provided by Bower .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 21]: It was a queer coincidence that Spencer harbored the same notion with regard to Stampa , and wondered at it .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 10]: `` I shall starve willingly , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 23]: `` It will be a just punishment for declining the good things that did not tempt me when they were available . ''
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 14]: Bower poured out a quantity of wine and drank it at a gulp .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 12]: He refilled the glass and nearly emptied it a second time .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 11]: But he touched not a morsel of meat or bread .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 13]: Helen , fortunately , attributed the conduct of the men to spleen .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 21]: She ate a sandwich , and found that she was far more ready for a meal than she had imagined .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 8]: Stampa 's broad frame darkened the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 13]: He told Karl not to burden himself with anything save the cutlery .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 26]: Now that he was the skilled guide again , the leader in whom they trusted , his worn face was animated and his voice eager .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 7]: Helen heard Spencer 's exclamation without .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 6]: `` By Jove , Stampa !
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 4]: you are right !
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 6]: Here comes the snow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 6]: `` Quick , quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 4]: cried Stampa . ''
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 6]: _ Vorwärtz _ , Barth .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 3]: You lead .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 5]: Stop at my call .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 12]: Karl next -- then the _ fräulein _ and my monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 9]: Yours follows , and I come last . ''
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 15]: burst out Bower , lowering a third glass of wine from his lips . ''
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 4]: _ Che diavolo !
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 10]: _ It shall be as I have said ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 8]: shouted Stampa , with an imperious gesture .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 15]: Helen remarked it ; but things were being done and said that were inexplicable .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 5]: Even Bower was silenced .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 10]: `` Are we to be roped , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 3]: growled Barth .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 12]: `` Have you never crossed ice during a snow storm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 3]: asked Stampa .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 8]: In a few minutes they were ready .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 22]: The lightning flashes were less frequent , and the thunder was muttering far away amid the secret places of the Bernina .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 6]: The wind was rising again .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 20]: Instead of sleet it carried snowflakes , and these did not sting the face nor patter on the ice .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 18]: But they clung everywhere , and the sable rocks were taking unto themselves a new garment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 3]: _ Vorwärtz !
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 18]: _ '' rang out Stampa 's trumpet like call , and Barth leaped down into the moraine .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 22]: CHAPTER X ON THE GLACIER Barth , a good man on ice and rock , was not a genius among guides .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 28]: Faced by an apparently unscalable rock wall , or lost in a wilderness of séracs , he would never guess the one way that led to success .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 31]: But he was skilled in the technic of his profession , and did not make the mistake now of subjecting Helen or Spencer to the risk of an ugly fall .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 14]: The air temperature had dropped from eighty degrees Fahrenheit to below freezing point .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 19]: Rocks that gave safe foothold an hour earlier were now glazed with an amalgam of sleet and snow .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 51]: If , in his dull mind , he wondered why Spencer came next to Helen , rather than Bower or Stampa , -- either of whom would know exactly when to give that timely aid with the rope that imparts such confidence to the novice , -- he said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 7]: Stampa 's eye was on him .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 7]: His pride was up in arms .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 17]: It behooved him to press on at just the right pace , and commit no blunder .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 34]: Helen , who had been glad to get back to the moraine during the ascent , was ready to breathe a sigh of relief when she felt her feet on the ice again .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 6]: Those treacherous rocks were affrighting .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 10]: They bereft her of trust in her own limbs .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 13]: She seemed to slip here and there without power to check herself .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 33]: She expected at any moment to stumble helplessly on some cruelly sharp angle of a granite boulder , and find that she was maimed so badly as to render another step impossible .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 19]: More than once she was sensible that the restraining pull on the rope alone held her from disaster .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 27]: Her distress did not hinder the growth of a certain surprise that the American should be so sure footed , so quick to judge her needs .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 26]: When by his help a headlong downward plunge was converted into a harmless slide over the sloping face of a rock , she half turned .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 21]: `` I must thank you for that afterward , '' she said , with a fine effort at a smile .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 12]: `` Eyes front , please , '' was the quiet answer .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 33]: Under less strenuous conditions it might have sounded curt ; but the look that met hers robbed the words of their tenseness , and sent the hot blood tingling in her veins .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 9]: Bower had never looked at her like that .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 43]: Just as some unusually vivid flash of lightning revealed the hidden depths of a crevasse , bringing plainly before the eye chinks and crannies not discernible in the strongest sunlight , so did the glimpse of Spencer 's soul illumine her understanding .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 25]: He was not only safeguarding her , but thinking of her , and the stolen knowledge set up a bewildering tumult in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 4]: `` Attention ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 14]: shouted Barth , halting and making a drive at something with his ax .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 4]: The line stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 18]: Stampa 's ringing voice came over Helen 's head : `` What is that ahead there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 8]: `` A new fall , I think .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 21]: We ought to leave the moraine a little lower down ; but this was not here when we ascended . ''
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 20]: How either man , Stampa especially , could see anything at all , was beyond the girl 's comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 6]: The snow was absolutely blinding .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 16]: The wind was full in their faces , and it carried the huge flakes upward .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 13]: They seemed to spring from beneath rather than drop from the clouds .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 22]: Ever and anon a weirdly blue gleam of lightning would give a demoniac touch to a scene worthy of the Inferno .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 9]: `` Make for the ice -- quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 11]: cried Stampa , and Barth turned sharply to the left .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 17]: Falling stones were now their chief danger , and both men were anxious to avoid it .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 10]: After a brief scramble they mounted the curving glacier .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 15]: A fiercer gust shrieked at them and swept some small space clear of snow .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 34]: Helen had a dim vision of lightning playing above the crest of a great mound on the edge of the ice field , -- a mound that she did not remember seeing before .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 22]: Then the gale sank back to its sustained howling , the snow swirled in denser volume , and the specter vanished .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 16]: Ere they had gone another hundred yards , Barth 's hoarse warning checked them again .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 7]: `` The bridge has fallen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 4]: was his cry .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 9]: `` There has been an ice movement . ''
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 10]: There was a question in the man 's words .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 42]: Here was a nice point submitted to his judgment , -- whether to follow the line of the recently formed schrund yawning at his feet , or endeavor to cross it , or go back to the scene of the landslip ?
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 7]: That was where Barth was lacking .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 16]: In that instant he resigned his pride of place without further effort to retain it .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 11]: He was in the van , but did not lead .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 5]: Thenceforth Stampa was master .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 10]: `` What is the width -- ten meters ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 6]: demanded the old guide cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 5]: `` About that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 5]: `` All the better .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 6]: It is not deep here .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 9]: The shock of that avalanche opened it up .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 7]: You will find a way down .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 6]: Cut the steps close together .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 10]: You know how to polish them , Karl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 13]: `` Yes , I can do that , '' said the porter .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 11]: `` And watch the _ sigñorina 's _ feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 9]: `` Yes , I 'll take care . ''
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 8]: Barth was peering fixedly into the chasm .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 34]: To Helen 's fancy it was bottomless , though in reality it was not more than forty feet deep , and the two walls fell away from each other at a practicable angle .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 24]: In normal summer weather , a small crevasse always formed there owing to the glacier flowing over a transverse ridge of rock beneath .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 19]: To-day the impact of many thousands of tons of débris had disrupted the ice to an unusual extent .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 15]: Having decided on the best line , the leading guide stepped over into space .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 18]: Helen heard his ax ringing as he fashioned secure foothold down the steep ledge he had selected .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 8]: He was quite trustworthy in such work .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 17]: Stampa , who had a thought for none save Helen , gave her a reassuring word .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 15]: `` Barth will find a way , _ fräulein _ , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 24]: `` And Herr Spencer knows how you should cross your feet and carry your ax , while Karl will see to your foothold .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 23]: Remember too that you will be at the bottom before I begin the descent , so no harm can come to you .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 5]: Try and stand straight .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 7]: Do n't lean against the slope .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 5]: Lean away from it .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 5]: Do n't be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 13]: Do n't trust to the rope or the grip of the ax .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 7]: Rely on your own stand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 24]: It was no time to pick and choose phrases , yet Helen realized the oddity of the absence of any reference to Bower .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 34]: One other in the party had a thought somewhat akin to hers ; but he slurred it over in his mind , and seized the opportunity to help her by a casual remark .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 14]: `` Guess you hardly expected genuine ice work in to-day 's trip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 12]: `` Stampa and I had a lot of it last week .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 14]: It 's as easy as walking down stairs when you know how . ''
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 25]: `` I do n't think I am afraid , '' she answered ; `` but I should have preferred to walk up stairs first .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 15]: This is rather reversing the natural order of things , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 5]: `` Nature loves irregularities .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 13]: That is why the prize girl in every novel has irregular features .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 14]: A heroine with a Greek face would kill a whole library . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 6]: _ Vorwärtz -- es geht !
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 12]: _ '' Barth 's gruff voice sounded hollow from the depths .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 14]: Karl , in his turn , went over the lip of the crevasse .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 20]: Helen , conscious of an exaltation that lifted her out of the region of ignoble fear , looked down .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 9]: She could see now what was being done .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 13]: Barth was swinging his ax and smiting the ice with the adz .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 25]: His head was just below the level of her feet , though he was distant the full length of two sections of the rope .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 7]: He had cut broad black steps .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 10]: They did not seem to present any great difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 19]: Helen found herself speculating on the remarkable light effects that made these notches black in a gray-green wall .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 10]: `` Right foot first , '' said Spencer quietly .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 20]: `` When that is firmly fixed , throw all your weight on it , and bring the left down .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 5]: Then the right again .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 7]: Hold the pick breast high . ''
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 4]: `` So ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 10]: cried Karl appreciatively , watching her first successful effort .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 19]: As Spencer was lowering himself into the crevasse , he heard something that set his nimble wits agog .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 57]: Stampa , the valiant and light hearted Stampa , the genial companion who had laughed and jested even when they were crossing an ice slope on the giant Monte della Disgrazia , -- a traverse of precarious clinging , where a slip meant death a thousand feet below , -- was muttering strangely at Bower . ''
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 3]: _ Schwein-hund !
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 27]: _ '' he was saying , `` if any evil befalls the _ fräulein _ , I shall drive my ax between your shoulder blades . ''
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 5]: There was no reply .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 8]: Spencer was sure he was not mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 19]: Though the guide spoke German , he knew enough of that language to understand this comparatively simple sentence .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 15]: Quite as amazing as Stampa 's threat was Bower 's silent acceptance of it .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 19]: He began to piece together some fleeting impressions of the curious wrangle between the two outside the hut .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 22]: He recalled Bower 's extraordinary change of tone when told that a man named Christian Stampa had followed him from Maloja .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 17]: Helen was just taking another confident step forward and down , balancing herself with graceful assurance .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 26]: Spencer had a few seconds in which to steal a backward glance , and a flash of lightning happened to glimmer on Bower 's features .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 50]: The American was not given to fanciful imaginings ; but during many a wild hour in the Far West he had seen the baleful frown of murder on a man 's face too often not to recognize it now in this snow scourged cleft of a mighty Alpine glacier .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 5]: Yet he was helpless .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 11]: He could neither speak nor act on a mere opinion .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 11]: He could only watch , and be on his guard .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 17]: From that moment he tried to observe every movement not only of Helen but of Bower .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 13]: The members of the party were roped at intervals of twenty feet .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 54]: Allowing for the depth of the crevasse , the amount of rope taken up in their hands ready to be served out as occasion required , and the inclination of Barth 's line of descent , the latter ought to be notching the opposing wall before Stampa quitted the surface of the glacier .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 44]: Though Spencer could not see Stampa now , he knew that the rear guide was bracing himself strongly against any tell-tale jerk , with the additional security of an anchor obtained by driving the pick of his ax deeply into the surface ice .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 51]: It was Bower 's business to keep the rope quite taut both above and below ; but the American was sure that he was gathering the slack behind him with his right hand while he carried the ax in his left , and did not use it to steady himself .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 18]: Spencer assumed , from various comments by Helen and others , that Bower was an adept climber .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 20]: Therefore , the passage of a schrund , or large , shallow crevasse was child 's play to him .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 28]: This departure from all the canons of the craft as imparted by Stampa during their first week on the hills together , struck Spencer as exceedingly dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 23]: He reflected that were it not for the words he had overheard , he would never have known of this curious proceeding .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 35]: Indeed , but for those words , with their sinister significance augmented by Bower 's devilish expression , had he even looked back by chance , the maneuver might not have attracted his attention .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 8]: What , then , did it imply ?
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 15]: Why should a skilled mountaineer break an imperative rule that permits of no exceptions ?
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 9]: He continued to watch Bower even more closely .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 19]: He devoted to the task every instant that consideration for Helen 's safety and his own would allow .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 9]: There was not much light in the crevasse .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 35]: Heavy clouds and the smothering snow wraiths hid the travelers under a dense pall that suggested the approach of night , although the actual time was about half past one o'clock in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 22]: The wind seemed to delight in torturing them with minute particles of ice that stung with a peculiar sensation of burning .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 5]: These were bad enough .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 19]: To add to their miseries , fine , powdery snowflakes settled on eyes and eyelids with blinding effect .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 11]: During a particularly baffling gust Helen uttered a slight exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 11]: Instantly Spencer stiffened himself , and Barth and Karl halted .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 9]: `` It is nothing , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 10]: `` For a second I could not see . ''
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 7]: Barth 's ax rang out again .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 16]: The vibrations of each lusty blow could be felt distinctly along the solid ice wall .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 28]: After a last downward step he would begin to notch his way up the other side , where the angle was much more favorable to rapid progress .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 8]: Spencer stole another glance over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 14]: Bower had fully ten feet of the rearmost section of rope in hand .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 7]: His head was thrown well back .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 20]: Standing with his face to the ice , he was striving to look over the lip of the schrund .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 24]: Stampa , feeling a steady tension , must be expecting the announcement momentarily that Barth was crossing the narrow crevice at the bottom .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 28]: Helen and Karl , intent on the operations of the leader , paid heed to nothing else ; but Spencer was fascinated by Bower 's peculiar actions .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 12]: At last , Barth 's deep bass reverberated triumphantly upward . ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 3]: _ Vorwärtz !
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 10]: _ '' '' _ Vorwärtz _ , Stampa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 28]: repeated Bower , suddenly changing the ice ax to his right hand and stretching the left as far along the rope and as high up as possible .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 6]: Simultaneously he raised the ax .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 11]: Then , and not till then , did Spencer understand .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 15]: Stampa must be on the point of relaxing his grip and preparing to descend .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 48]: If Bower cut the rope with a single stroke of the adz , a violent tug at the sundered end would precipitate Stampa headlong into the crevasse , while there would be ample evidence to show that he had himself severed the rope by a miscalculated blow .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 7]: The fall would surely kill him .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 30]: When his corpse was recovered , it would be found that the cut had been made much closer to his own body than to that of his nearest neighbor .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 4]: `` Stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 11]: roared Spencer , all a-quiver with wrath at his discovery .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 11]: Obedience to the climbers ' law held the others rigid .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 5]: That command implied danger .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 17]: It called for an instant tightening of every muscle to withstand the strain of a slip .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 32]: Even Bower , a man on the very brink of committing a fiendish crime , yielded to a subconscious acceptance of the law , and kept himself braced in his steps .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 13]: The American was well fitted to handle a crisis of that nature .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 7]: `` Hold fast , Stampa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 6]: `` What is wrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 26]: came the ready cry , for the rear guide had already driven the pick of his ax into the ice again after having withdrawn it .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 5]: Then Spencer spoke English .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 24]: `` I happen to be watching you , '' he said slowly , never relaxing a steel-cold scrutiny of Bower 's livid face .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 10]: `` You seem to forget what you are doing .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 13]: Follow me until you have taken up the slack of the rope .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 5]: Do you understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 10]: Bower continued to gaze at him with lack-luster eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 21]: All he realized was that his murderous design was frustrated ; but how or why he neither knew nor cared .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 7]: `` Do you hear me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 6]: demanded Spencer even more sternly .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 13]: `` Come along , or I shall explain myself more fully ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 10]: Without answering , the other made shift to move .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 14]: Spencer , however , meant to save the unwitting guide from further hazard .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 14]: `` Do n't stir , Stampa , till I give the order ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 4]: he sang out .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 12]: `` All right , monsieur , but we are losing time .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 6]: What is Barth doing there ?
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 3]: _ Saperlotte !
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 38]: _ If I were in front -- '' Bower , who owned certain strong qualities , swallowed something , took three strides downward , and said calmly : `` I was waiting to give Stampa a hand .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 8]: He is lame , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 10]: Helen , of course , heard all that passed .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 17]: She had long since abandoned the effort to disentangle the skein of that day 's events .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 7]: Everybody was talking and acting unnaturally .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 18]: Perhaps the ravel of things would clear itself when they regained the commonplace world of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 20]: In any case , she wished the men would hurry , for it was unutterably cold in the crevasse .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 11]: At last , then , there was a movement ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 5]: Barth began to mount .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 29]: Muttering an instruction to Karl that he was to give the girl a friendly pull , he cut smaller steps more widely apart and at a steeper gradient .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 16]: Soon they were on the floor of the ice and hurrying to the next bridge .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 8]: Not a word was spoken by anyone .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 21]: The fury of the gale and the ever gathering snow made it imperative that not a moment should be wasted .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 22]: The lightning was decreasing perceptibly , while the occasional peals of thunder were scarcely audible above the soughing of the wind .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 23]: A tremendous crash on the right announced the fall of another avalanche ; but it did not affect the next broad crevasse .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 12]: The bridge they had used a few hours earlier stood firm .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 16]: Indeed , it was new welded by regelation since the sun 's rays had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 14]: The leader kept a perfect line , never deviating from the right track .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 31]: Helen , who had completely lost her bearings , thought they had a long way farther to go , when she saw Barth stop and begin to unfasten the rope .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 20]: Then a thrust with the butt of her _ pickel _ told her that she was standing on rock .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 22]: When she cleared her eyes of the flying snow , she saw a well defined curving ribbon amid the white chaos .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 10]: It was the path , covered six inches deep .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 20]: The violent exertions of nearly three hours since she left the hut had induced a pleasant sense of languor .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 19]: Did she dare to suggest it , she would have liked to sit down and rest for awhile .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 22]: Bower , who had substituted reasoned thought for his madness , addressed Spencer with easy complacence while Barth was unroping them .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 19]: `` Why did you believe that I was doing a risky thing in stopping to assist Stampa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 13]: `` I guess you know best , '' was the uncompromising answer .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 8]: `` Yes , I think I do .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 27]: Of course , I could not argue the matter then , but I fancy my climbing experience is far greater than yours , Mr. Spencer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 6]: His sheer impudence was admirable .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 14]: He even smiled in the superior way of an expert lecturing a novice .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 6]: But Spencer did not smile .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 14]: `` Do you really want to hear my views on your conduct ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 5]: `` No , thanks .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 21]: The discussion might prove interesting , but we can adjourn it to the coffee and cigar period after dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 9]: His eyes fell under Spencer 's contemptuous glance .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 6]: Yet he carried himself bravely .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 40]: Though the man he meant to kill , and another man who had read his inmost thought in time to prevent a tragedy , were looking at him fixedly , he turned away with a laugh on his lips .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 28]: `` I am afraid , Miss Wynton , you will regard me in future as a broken reed where Alpine excursions are concerned , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 14]: `` You were mistaken -- that is obvious , '' said Helen frankly .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 6]: `` But so was Barth .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 12]: He agreed that the storm would be only a passing affair .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 21]: Do n't you think we are very deeply indebted to Mr. Spencer and Stampa for coming to our assistance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 6]: `` I do , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 8]: Stampa , one can reward in kind .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 13]: This sort of thing used to be his business , I hear .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 15]: As for Mr. Spencer , a smile from you will repay him tenfold . ''
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 26]: `` Herr Spencer , '' broke in Stampa , `` you go on with the _ sigñorina _ and see that she does not slip .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 4]: She is tired .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 10]: Marcus Bauer and I have matters to discuss . ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 23]: The old man 's unwonted harshness appealed to the girl as did the host of other queer happenings on that memorable day .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 4]: Bower moved uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 8]: A vindictive gleam shot from his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 6]: Helen missed none of this .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 29]: But she was fatigued , and her feet were cold and wet , while the sleet encountered on the upper glacier had almost soaked her to the skin .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 18]: Nevertheless , she strove bravely to lighten the cloud that seemed to have settled on the men .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 12]: `` That means a wordy warfare , '' she said gayly .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 8]: `` I pity you , Mr. Bower .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 9]: You can not wriggle out of your difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 12]: The snow will soon be a foot deep in the valley .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 16]: Goodness only knows what would have become of us up there in the hut ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 17]: He bowed gracefully , with a hint of the foreign air she had noted once before .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 32]: `` I would have brought you safely out of greater perils , '' he said ; `` but every dog has his day , and this is Stampa 's . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 4]: _ En route !
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 7]: _ '' cried the guide impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 28]: He loathed the sight of Bower standing there , smiling and courteous , in the presence of one whom he regarded as a Heaven-sent friend and protectress .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 9]: Spencer attributed his surliness to its true cause .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 13]: It supplied another bit of the mosaic he was slowly piecing together .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 34]: Greatly as he preferred Helen 's company , he was willing to sacrifice at least ten minutes of it , could he but listen to the `` discussion '' between Stampa and Bower .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 7]: Therein he would have erred greatly .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 9]: Helen was tired , and she admitted it .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 14]: She did not decline his aid when the path was steep and slippery .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 39]: In delightful snatches of talk they managed to say a good deal to each other , and Helen did not fail to make plain the exact circumstances under which she first caught sight of Spencer outside the hut .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 24]: When they arrived at the carriage road , which begins at Lake Cavloccio , they could walk side by side and chat freely .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 10]: Here , in the valley , matters were normal .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 12]: The snow did not place such a veil on all things .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 17]: The windings of the road often brought them abreast of the four men in the rear .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 17]: Bower was trudging along alone , holding his head down , and seemingly lost in thought .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 9]: Close behind him came Stampa and the Engadiners .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 23]: Karl , of course , was talking -- the others might or might not be lending their ears to his interminable gossip .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 7]: `` We are outstripping our companions .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 12]: Do n't you think we ought to wait for them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 12]: said Helen once , when Bower chanced to look her way .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 7]: `` You are exceedingly positive . ''
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 9]: `` I tried to be exceedingly negative . ''
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 5]: `` But why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 12]: `` I rather fancy that they would jar on us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 12]: `` But Stampa 's promised lecture appears to have ended ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 7]: `` I think it never began .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 21]: It is a safe bet that Mr. Bower and he have not exchanged a word since our last halt . ''
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 3]: Helen laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 13]: `` A genuine case of Greek meeting Greek , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 20]: `` Stampa is an excellent guide , I am sure ; but Mr. Bower does really know these mountains .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 13]: I suppose anyone is liable to err in forecasting Alpine weather . ''
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 5]: `` That is nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 16]: If it were you or I , Stampa would dismiss the point with a grin .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 14]: You heard how he chaffed Barth , yet trusted him with the lead ?
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 9]: These two have an old feud to settle .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 8]: You will hear more of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 4]: `` A feud !
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 14]: Mr. Bower declared to me that Stampa was absolutely unknown to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 14]: `` It is n't necessary to know a man before you hate him .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 10]: I can give you a heap of historic examples .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 14]: For instance , who has a good word to say for Ananias ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 14]: The girl understood that he meant to parry her question with a quip .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 17]: The cross purposes so much in evidence all day were baffling and mysterious to its close .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 24]: `` My own opinion is that both you and Stampa have taken an unreasonable dislike to Mr. Bower , '' she said determinedly .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 11]: The words were out before she quite realized their import .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 5]: She flushed a little .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 11]: Spencer was gazing down into the gorge of the Orlegna .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 21]: The brawling torrent chimed with his own mood ; but his set face gave no token of the storm within .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 19]: He only said quietly , `` How good it must be to have you as a friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 19]: `` I have no reason to feel other than friendly to Mr. Bower , '' she protested hotly .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 15]: `` It was the rarest good fortune for me that he came to Maloja .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 21]: I met him once in London , and a second time , by accident , during my journey to Switzerland .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 31]: Yet , widely known as he is in society , he was sufficiently large minded to disregard the sneers and innuendoes of some of those horrid women in the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 13]: He has gone out of his way to show me every kindness .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 13]: Why should I not repay it by speaking well of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 29]: `` I shall lay my head on the nearest tree stump , and you can smite me with your ax , good and hard , '' said Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 4]: She laughed angrily .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 16]: `` I do n't know what evil influence is possessing us , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 5]: `` Everything is awry .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 7]: Even the sun refuses to shine .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 23]: Here am I storming at one to whom I owe my life -- '' `` No , '' he broke in decisively .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 21]: `` Do n't put it that way , because the whole credit of the relief expedition is due to Stampa .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 17]: Say , Miss Wynton , may I square my small services by asking a favor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 18]: `` Well , then , if it lies in your power , keep Stampa and Bower apart .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 12]: In any event , do n't intervene in their quarrel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 16]: `` So you are quite serious in your belief that there is a quarrel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 23]: The American saw again in his mind 's eye the scene in the crevasse when Bower had raised his ax to strike .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 30]: `` Quite serious , '' he replied , and the gravity in his voice was so marked that Helen placed a contrite hand on his arm for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 19]: `` Please , I am sorry if I was rude to you just now , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 18]: `` I have had a long day , and my nerves are worn to a fine edge .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 21]: I used to flatter myself that I had n't any nerves ; but they have come to the surface here .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 8]: It must be the thin air . ''
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 12]: `` Then it is a bad place for an American . ''
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 12]: `` Ah , that reminds me of something I had forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 14]: I meant to ask you how you came to remain in the Maloja .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 8]: Is that too inquisitive on my part ?
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 14]: I can account for the presence of the other Americans in the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 15]: They belong to the Paris colony , and are interested in tennis and golf .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 9]: I have not seen you playing either game .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 13]: In fact , you moon about in solitary grandeur , like myself .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 6]: And -- oh , dear !
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 6]: what a string of questions !
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 19]: -- is it true that you wanted to play baccarat with Mr. Bower for a thousand pounds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 32]: `` It is true that I agreed to share a bank with Mr. Dunston , and the figure you mention was suggested ; but I backed out of the proposition . ''
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 43]: `` Because your friend , Mr. Hare , thought he was responsible , in a sense , having introduced me to Dunston ; so I let up on the idea , -- just to stop him from feeling bad about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 12]: `` You really meant to play in the first instance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 10]: `` Well , it was very wicked of you .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 23]: Only the other day you were telling me how hard you had to work before you saved your first thousand pounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 11]: `` From that point of view my conduct was idiotic .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 15]: But I would like to carry the story a little further , Miss Wynton .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 23]: I was in a mood that night to oppose Mr. Bower for a much more valuable stake if the chance offered . ''
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 10]: `` It is rather shocking , '' said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 5]: `` I suppose so .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 18]: Of course , there are prizes in life that can not be measured by monetary standards . ''
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 19]: He was not looking at the Orlegna now , and the girl by his side well knew it .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 19]: The great revelation that flooded her soul with light while crossing the Forno came back with renewed power .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 24]: She did not pretend to herself that the words were devoid of a hidden meaning , and her heart fluttered with subtle ecstasy .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 33]: But she was proud and self reliant , so proud that she crushed the tumult in her breast , so self reliant that she was able to give him a timid smile .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 18]: `` That deals with the second head of the indictment , then , '' she said lightly .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 6]: `` Now for the first .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 11]: Why did you select the Engadine for your holiday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 22]: `` If I could tell you that , I should know something of the occult impulses that govern men 's lives .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 12]: One minute I was in London , meaning to go north .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 14]: The next I was hurrying to buy a ticket for St. Moritz . ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 21]: `` But -- '' She meant to continue , `` you arrived here the same day as I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 12]: Somehow that did not sound quite the right thing to say .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 13]: Her tongue tripped ; but she forced herself to frame a sentence .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 23]: `` It is odd that you , like myself , should have hit upon an out of the way place like Maloja .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 19]: The difference is that I was sent here , whereas you came of your own free will . ''
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 21]: `` I guess you are right , '' said he , laughing as though she had uttered an exquisite joke .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 8]: `` Yes , that is just it .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 23]: I can imagine two young English swallows , meeting in Algeria in the winter , twittering explanations of the same sort . ''
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 38]: `` I do n't feel a bit like a swallow , and I am sure I ca n't twitter , and as for Algeria , a home of sunshine -- well , just look at it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 37]: She waved a hand at the darkening panorama of hills and pine woods , all etched in black lines and masses , where rocks and trees and houses broke the dead white of the snow mantle .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 21]: They happened to be crossing a bridge that spans the Orlegna before it takes its first frantic plunge towards Italy .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 21]: Bower , who had quickened his pace , took the gesture as a signal , and sent an answering flourish .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 3]: Helen stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 7]: He evidently wished to overtake them .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 8]: `` More explanations , '' murmured Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 6]: `` But he was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 14]: I was calling Nature to witness that your simile was not justified . ''
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 41]: `` Tell you what , '' he said in a low voice , `` if this storm has blown over by the morning , meet me after breakfast , and we will walk down the valley to Vicosoprano for luncheon .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 9]: There is a diligence back in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 21]: We can stroll there in three hours , and I shall have time to clear up this swallow proposition . ''
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 12]: `` That will be delightful , if the weather improves . ''
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 4]: `` It will .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 6]: I will compel it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 6]: Bower was nearing them rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 7]: A constrained silence fell between them .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 20]: To end it , Helen cried : `` Well , are you feeling duly humbled , Mr. Bower ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 9]: He did not seem to understand her meaning .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 11]: Apparently , he might have forgotten that Stampa still lived .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 9]: Then he roused his wits with an effort .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 11]: `` Not humbled , but elated , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 11]: `` Have I not led you to feats of derring-do ?
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 18]: Why , the Wragg girls will be green with envy when they hear of your exploits . ''
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 9]: He swung round the corner to the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 15]: After a smiling glance at Spencer 's impassive face , he turned to Helen .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 16]: `` You have come out of the ordeal with flying colors , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 13]: `` That flower you picked on the way up has not withered .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 9]: Give it to me as a memento . ''
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 7]: The words were almost a challenge .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 4]: The girl hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 7]: `` No , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 10]: `` I must find you some other souvenir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 17]: `` But I want that -- if -- '' `` There is no ` if . '
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 17]: You forget that I took it from -- from the boulder marked by a cross . ''
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 7]: `` I am not superstitious . ''
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 18]: `` Nor am I. Nevertheless , I should not care to give you such a symbol . ''
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 10]: She caught Bower and Spencer exchanging a strange look .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 12]: These men shared some secret that they sedulously kept from her .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 14]: Perhaps the American meant to enlighten her during their projected walk to Vicosoprano .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 6]: Stampa and the others approached .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 14]: Together they climbed the little hill leading to the summit of the pass .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 16]: In the village they said `` Good night '' to the two guides and Karl .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 17]: Helen promised laughingly to make the acquaintance of Johann Klucker 's cat at the first opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 26]: She was passing through a wicket that protects the footpath across the golf links , when she heard Stampa growl : '' _ Morgen früh !
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 6]: _ '' '' _ Ja !
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 5]: _ '' snapped Bower .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 15]: She smiled to herself at the thought that things were going to happen to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 4]: She was right .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 11]: But she had not yet done with the present day .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 25]: When she entered the cozy and brilliantly lighted veranda of the hotel , the first person her amazed eyes alighted upon was Millicent Jaques .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 11]: CHAPTER XI WHEREIN HELEN LIVES A CROWDED HOUR `` Millicent !
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 4]: You here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 16]: Helen breathed the words in an undertone that carried more than a hint of dismay .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 24]: It was one of those rare crises in life when the brain receives a presage of evil without any prior foundation of fact .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 18]: Helen had every reason to welcome her friend , none to be chilled by her unexpected presence .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 16]: Among a small circle of intimate acquaintances she counted Millicent Jaques the best and truest .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 16]: They had drifted apart ; but that was owing to Helen 's lack of means .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 25]: She was not able , nor did she aspire , to mix in the society that hailed the actress as a bright particular star .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 80]: Yet it meant much to a girl earning her daily bread in a heedless city that she should possess one friend of her own age and sex who could speak of the golden years when they were children together , -- the years when Helen 's father was the prospective governor of an Indian province as large as France ; when the tuft hunters now gathered in Maloja would have fawned on her mother in hope of subsequent recognition .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 11]: Why , then , did Helen falter in her greeting ?
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 4]: Who can tell ?
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 42]: She herself did not know , unless it was that Millicent rose so leisurely from the table at which she was drinking a belated cup of tea , and came toward her with a smile that had no warmth in it .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 17]: `` So you have returned , '' she said , `` and with both cavaliers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 12]: Helen was conscious of a queer humming noise in her head .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 7]: She was incapable of calm thought .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 21]: She realized now that the friend she had left in London was here in the guise of a bitter enemy .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 11]: The veranda was full of people waiting for the post .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 11]: The snow had banished them from links and tennis court .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 12]: This August afternoon was dark as mid-December at the same hour .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 32]: But the rendezvous was brilliantly lighted , and the reappearance of the climbers , whose chances of safety had been eagerly debated since the snow storm began , drew all eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 58]: Someone had whispered too that the beautiful woman who arrived from St. Moritz half an hour earlier , who sat in her furs and sipped her tea after a long conversation with a clerk in the bureau , was none other than Millicent Jaques , the dancer , one of the leading lights of English musical comedy .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 17]: The peepers and whisperers little dreamed that she could be awaiting the party from the Forno .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 51]: Now that her vigil was explained , for Bower had advanced with ready smile and outstretched hand , the Wraggs and Vavasours and de la Veres -- all the little coterie of gossips and scandalmongers -- were drawn to the center of the hall like steel filings to a magnet .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 4]: Millicent ignored Bower .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 19]: She was young enough and pretty enough to feel sure of her ability to deal with him subsequently .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 6]: Her cornflower blue eyes glittered .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 11]: They held something of the quiet menace of a crevasse .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 16]: She had traveled far for revenge , and she did not mean to forego it .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 31]: Helen , whose second impulse was to kiss her affectionately , with excited clamor of welcome and inquiry , stood rooted to the floor by her friend 's strange words .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 35]: `` I -- I am so surprised -- '' she half stammered in an agony of confused doubt ; and that was the only lame phrase she could utter during a few trying seconds .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 3]: Bower frowned .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 6]: He hated scenes between women .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 11]: With his first glimpse of Millicent he guessed her errand .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 32]: For Helen 's sake , in the presence of that rabbit-eared crowd , he would not brook the unmerited flood of sarcastic indignation which he knew was trembling on her lips .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 14]: `` Miss Wynton has had an exhausting day , '' he said coolly .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 12]: `` She must go straight to her room , and rest .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 10]: You two can meet and talk after dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 10]: Without further preamble , he took Helen 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 5]: Millicent barred the way .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 6]: She did not give place .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 9]: Again she paid no heed to the man .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 35]: `` I shall not detain you long , '' she said , looking only at Helen , and speaking in a low clear voice that her stage training rendered audible throughout the large hall .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 15]: `` I only wished to assure myself that what I was told was true .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 19]: I found it hard to believe , even when I saw your name written up in the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 29]: Before I go , let me congratulate you on your conquest -- and Mr. Mark Bower on his , '' she added , with clever pretense of afterthought .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 8]: Helen continued to stare at her helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 10]: Her lips quivered ; but they uttered no sound .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 9]: It was impossible to misunderstand Millicent 's object .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 11]: She meant to wound and insult in the grossest way .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 21]: Bower dropped Helen 's arm , and strode close to the woman who had struck this shrewd blow at him .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 9]: `` I give you this one chance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 10]: he muttered , while his eyes blazed into hers .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 15]: `` Go to your room , or sit down somewhere till I am free .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 15]: I shall come to you , and put things straight that now seem crooked .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 11]: You are wrong , horribly wrong , in your suspicions .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 22]: Wait my explanation , or by all that I hold sacred , you will regret it to your dying hour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 6]: Millicent drew back a little .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 13]: She conveyed the suggestion that his nearness was offensive to her nostrils .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 11]: And she laughed , with due semblance of real amusement .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 10]: Has she made a fool of you too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 4]: she cried bitingly .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 13]: Then Helen did exactly the thing she ought not to have done .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 3]: She fainted .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 23]: Spencer , in his own vivid phrase , was `` looking for trouble '' the instant he caught sight of the actress .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 41]: Had some Mahatma-devised magic lantern focused on the screen of his inner consciousness a complete narrative of the circumstances which conspired to bring Millicent Jaques to the Upper Engadine , he could not have mastered cause and effect more fully .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 50]: The unlucky letter he asked Mackenzie to send to the Wellington Theater -- the letter devised as a probe into Bower 's motives , but which was now cruelly searching its author 's heart -- had undoubtedly supplied to a slighted woman the clew to her rival 's identity .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 31]: Better posted than Bower in the true history of Helen 's visit to Switzerland , he did not fail to catch the most significant word in Millicent 's scornful greeting .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 9]: `` And with _ both _ cavaliers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 40]: In all probability , she knew the whole ridiculous story , reading into it the meaning lent by jealous spleen , and no more to be convinced of error than the Forno glacier could be made to flow backward .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 17]: -LSB- Illustration : `` No , '' said Spencer , `` ring for the elevator . ''
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 25]: _ Page 217 _ -RSB- But if his soul was vexed by a sense of bygone folly , his brain was cool and alert .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 6]: He saw Helen sway slightly .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 10]: He caught her before she collapsed where she stood .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 8]: He gathered her tenderly in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 13]: She might have been a tired child , fallen asleep too soon .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 8]: Her limp head rested on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 17]: Through the meshes of her blue veil he could see the sudden pallor of her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 13]: The tint of the silk added to the lifelessness of her aspect .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 19]: Just then Spencer 's heart was sore within him , and he was an awkward man to oppose .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 15]: George de Courcy Vavasour happened to crane his neck nearer at the wrong moment .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 11]: The American sent him flying with a vigorous elbow thrust .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 8]: He shoved Bower aside with scant ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 35]: Millicent Jaques met a steely glance that quelled the vengeful sparkle in her own eyes , and caused her to move quickly , lest , perchance , this pale-faced American should trample on her .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 32]: Before Bower could recover his balance , for his hobnails caused him to slip on the tiled floor , Spencer was halfway across the inner hall , and approaching the elevator .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 13]: An official of the hotel hastened forward with ready proffer of help .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 9]: `` This way , '' he said sympathetically .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 17]: `` The lady was overcome by the heat after so many hours in the intense cold .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 4]: It often occurs .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 5]: She will recover soon .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 10]: Bring her to a chair in the office . ''
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 43]: But Spencer was not willing that Helen 's first wondering glance should rest on strangers , or that , when able to walk to her own apartments , she should be compelled to pass through the ranks of gapers in the lounge .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 7]: `` No , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 6]: `` Ring for the elevator .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 28]: This lady must be taken to her room , -- No. 80 , I believe , -- then the manageress and a chambermaid can attend to her .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 2]: Quick !
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 4]: the elevator ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 9]: Bower turned on Millicent like an angry bull .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 12]: `` You have chosen your own method , '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 7]: You shall pay for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 15]: Her venom was such that she was by no means disturbed by his threat .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 24]: `` The other man -- the American who brought her here -- seems to have bested you throughout , '' she taunted him .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 9]: He drew himself up with a certain dignity .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 40]: He was aware that every tongue in the place was stilled , that every ear was tuned to catch each note of this fantastic quartet , -- a sonata appassionata in which vibrated the souls of men and women .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 34]: He looked from Millicent 's pallid face to the faces of the listeners , some of whom made pretense of polite indifference , while others did not scruple to exhibit their eager delight .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 22]: If nothing better , the episode would provide an abundance of spicy gossip during the enforced idleness caused by the weather .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 28]: `` The lady whom you are endeavoring to malign , will , I hope , do me the honor of becoming my wife , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 20]: `` That being so , she is beyond the reach of the slanderous malice of an ex-chorus girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 15]: He spoke slowly , with the air of a man who weighed his words .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 12]: A thrill that could be felt ran through his intent audience .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 75]: Mark Bower , the millionaire , the financial genius who dominated more than one powerful group in the city , who controlled a ring of theaters in London and the provinces , who had declined a knighthood , and would surely be created a peer with the next change of government , -- that he should openly declare himself a suitor for the hand of a penniless girl was a sensation with a vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 18]: His description of Millicent as an ex-chorus girl offered another _ bonne bouche _ to the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 21]: She would never again skip airily behind the footlights of the Wellington , or any other important theater in England .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 25]: So far as she was concerned , the musical comedy candle that succeeded to the sacred lamp of West End burlesque was snuffed out .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 11]: Millicent was actress enough not to flinch from the goad .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 15]: `` A charming and proper sentiment , '' she cried with well simulated flippancy .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 39]: `` The marriage of Mr. Mark Bower will be quite a fashionable event , provided always that he secures the assent of the American gentleman who is paying his future wife 's expenses during her present holiday . ''
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 48]: Now , so curiously constituted is human nature , or the shallow worldliness that passes current for it among the homeless gadabouts who pose as British society on the Continent , that already the current of opinion in the hotel was setting steadily in Helen 's favor .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 17]: The remarkable change dated from the moment of Bower 's public announcement of his matrimonial plans .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 10]: Many of those present were regretting a lost opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 46]: It was obvious to the meanest intelligence -- and the worn phrase took a new vitality when applied to some among the company -- that any kindness shown to Helen during the preceding fortnight would be repaid a hundredfold when she became Mrs. Mark Bower .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 31]: Again , not even the bitterest of her critics could allege that she was flirting with the quiet mannered American who had just carried her off like a new Paris .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 18]: She had lived in the same hotel for a whole week without speaking a word to him .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 37]: If anything , she had shown favor only to Bower , and that in a way so decorous and discreet that more than one woman there was amazed by her careless handling of a promising situation .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 18]: Just give one of them the chance of securing such a prize fish as this stalwart millionaire !
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 16]: Well , at least he should not miss the hook for lack of a bait .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 20]: Oddly enough , the Rev. Philip Hare gave voice to a general sentiment when he interfered in the duel .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 11]: He , like others , was waiting for his letters .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 32]: He saw Helen come in , and was hurrying to offer his congratulations on her escape from the storm , when the appearance of Millicent prevented him from speaking at once .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 13]: The little man was hot with vexation at the scene that followed .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 30]: He liked Helen ; he was unutterably shocked by Millicent 's attack ; and he resented the unfair and untrue construction that must be placed on her latest innuendo .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 35]: `` As one who has made Miss Wynton 's acquaintance in this hotel , '' he broke in vehemently , `` I must protest most emphatically against the outrageous statement we have just heard .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 18]: If I may say it , it is unworthy of the lady who is responsible for it .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 60]: I know nothing of your quarrel , nor do I wish to figure in it ; but I do declare , on my honor as a clergyman of the Church of England , that Miss Wynton 's conduct in Maloja has in no way lent itself to the inference one is compelled to draw from the words used . ''
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 23]: `` Thank you , Mr. Hare , '' said Bower quietly , and a subdued murmur of applause buzzed through the gathering .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 35]: There is a legend in Zermatt that Saint Theodule , patron of the Valais , wishing to reach Rome in a hurry , sought demoniac aid to surmount the impassable barrier of the Alps .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 14]: Opening his window , he saw three devils dancing merrily on the housetops .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 4]: He called them .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 9]: `` Which of you is the speediest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 16]: `` I , '' said one , `` I am swift as the wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 5]: -- `` Bah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 13]: cried the second , `` I can fly like a bullet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 12]: -- `` These two talk idly , '' said the third .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 12]: `` I am quick as the thought of a woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 7]: The worthy prelate chose the third .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 30]: The hour being late , he bargained that he should be carried to Rome and back before cockcrow , the price for the service to be his saintly soul .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 17]: The imp flew well , and returned to the valley of the Rhone long ere dawn .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 32]: Joyous at his gain , he was about to bound over the wall of the episcopal city of Sion , when St. Theodule roared lustily , '' _ Coq , chante !
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 4]: Que tu chantes !
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 8]: Ou que jamais plus tu ne chantes !
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 41]: _ '' Every cock in Sion awoke at his voice , and raised such a din that the devil dropped a bell given to his saintship by the Holy Father , and Saint Theodule was snug and safe inside it .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 11]: The prelate was right in his choice of the third .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 9]: The thoughts of two women took wings instantly .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 17]: Mrs. de la Vere , throwing away a half-smoked cigarette , hurried out of the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 21]: Millicent Jaques , whose carriage was ready for the long drive to St. Moritz , decided to remain in Maloja .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 17]: The outer door opened , with a rush of cold air and a whirl of snow .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 27]: People expected the postman ; but Stampa entered , -- only Stampa , the broken survivor of the little band of guides who conquered the Matterhorn .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 21]: He doffed his Alpine hat , and seemed to be embarrassed by the unusually large throng assembled in the passageway .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 13]: Bower saw him , and strode away into the dimly lighted foyer .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 44]: `` Pardon , _ ` sieurs et ` dames _ , '' said Stampa , advancing with his uneven gait , a venerable and pathetic figure , the wreck of a giant , a man who had aged years in a single day .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 17]: He went to the bureau , and asked permission to seek Herr Spencer in his room .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 32]: * * * * * Helen was struggling back to consciousness when Mrs. de la Vere joined the kindly women who were loosening her bodice and chafing her hands and feet .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 10]: The first words the girl heard were in English .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 15]: A woman 's voice was saying cheerfully , `` There , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 13]: a simple formula of marvelous recuperative effect , -- `` there now !
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 6]: You are all right again .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 7]: But your room is bitterly cold .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 7]: Wo n't you come into mine ?
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 15]: It is quite near , and my stove has been alight all day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 16]: Helen , opening her eyes , found herself gazing up at Mrs. de la Vere .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 8]: Real sympathy ranks high among good deeds .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 6]: The girl 's lips quivered .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 7]: Returning life brought with it tears .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 25]: The woman whom she had regarded as a social butterfly sat beside her on the bed and placed a friendly arm round her neck .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 14]: `` Do n't cry , you dear thing , '' she cooed gently .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 8]: `` There is nothing to cry about .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 34]: You are a bit overwrought , of course ; but , as it happens , you have scored heavily off all of us -- and not least off the creature who upset you .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 9]: Now , do try and come with me .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 5]: Here are your slippers .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 5]: The corridor is empty .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 8]: It is only a few steps . ''
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 6]: `` Come with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 18]: `` Yes , you are shivering with the cold , and my room is gloriously warm . ''
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 10]: `` But -- '' `` There are no buts .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 10]: Marie will bring a basin of nice hot soup .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 12]: While you are drinking it she will set your stove going .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 7]: I know exactly how you feel .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 32]: The whole world is topsyturvy , and you do n't think there is a smile in your make-up , as that dear American man who carried you here would say . ''
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 8]: Helen recovered her senses with exceeding rapidity .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 12]: Mrs. de la Vere was already leading her to the door .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 11]: Mr. Spencer -- did he -- '' `` He did .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 4]: Come , now .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 34]: I shall tell you all the trying details when you are seated in my easy chair , and wrapped in the duckiest Shetland shawl that a red headed laird sent me last Christmas .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 2]: Excellent !
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 6]: Of course you can walk !
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 17]: Is n't every other woman in the hotel well aware how you got that lovely figure ?
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 6]: Yes , in that chair .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 6]: And here is the shawl .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 12]: It 's just like being cuddled by a woolly lamb . ''
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 11]: Mrs. de la Vere turned the keys in two doors .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 43]: `` Reggie always knocks , '' she explained ; `` but some inquisitive cat may follow me here , and I am sure you do n't wish to be gushed over now , after everybody has been so horrid to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 10]: `` You were not , '' said Helen gratefully .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 10]: `` Yes , I was , in a way .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 23]: I hate most women ; but I admired you ever since you took the conceit out of that giddy husband of mine .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 34]: If I did n't speak , it arose from sheer laziness -- a sort of drifting with the stream , in tow of the General and that old mischief maker , Mrs. Vavasour .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 26]: I 'm sorry , and you will be quite justified to-morrow morning in sailing past me and the rest as though we were beetles . ''
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 27]: Then Helen laughed , feebly , it is true , but with a genuine mirth that chased away momentarily the evergrowing memory of Millicent 's injustice .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 8]: `` Why do you mention beetles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 14]: `` It is part of my every day work to classify them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 7]: Mrs. de la Vere was puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 14]: `` I believe you have said something very cutting , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 9]: `` If you did , we deserve it .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 7]: But please tell me the joke .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 10]: I shall hand it on to the Wraggs . ''
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 6]: `` There is no joke .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 23]: I act as secretary to a German professor of entomology -- insects , you know ; he makes beetles a specialty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 7]: The other woman 's eye danced .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 19]: `` It is all very funny , '' she said , `` and I still have my doubts .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 3]: Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 8]: I want to atone for earlier shortcomings .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 25]: I felt that someone really ought to tell you what took place in the outer foyer after you sank gracefully out of the act .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 16]: Mr. Bower -- '' A tap on the door leading into the corridor interrupted her .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 12]: It was Marie , armed with chicken broth and dry toast .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 29]: Mrs. de la Vere , who seemed to be filled with an honest anxiety to place Helen at her ease , persuaded her to begin sipping the compound .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 10]: `` Well , what did Mr. Bower do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 12]: demanded Helen , who was wondering now why she had fainted .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 11]: The accusation brought against her by Millicent Jaques was untrue .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 8]: Why should it disturb her so gravely ?
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 21]: It did not occur to her that the true cause was physical , -- a too sudden change of temperature .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 18]: `` He sat on that young woman from the Wellington Theater very severely , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 28]: From her manner we all imagined she had some sort of claim on him ; but if she was laboring under any such delusion he cured her .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 14]: He said -- Are you really strong enough to stand a shock ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 4]: `` Twenty shocks .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 19]: I ca n't think how I could have been so silly -- '' `` Nerves , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 5]: We all have 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 11]: Sometimes , if I did n't smoke I should scream .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 14]: No woman really likes to see her husband flirting openly with her friends .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 11]: I 'm no saint ; but my wickedness is defensive .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 7]: Now , are you ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 5]: `` Quite ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 23]: `` Mr. Bower told us , _ tout le monde _ , you know , that he meant to marry you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 3]: said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 8]: During an appreciable pause neither woman spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 13]: Helen was not sure whether she wanted to laugh or be angry .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 8]: Mrs. de la Vere eyed her curiously .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 10]: The girl 's face was yet white and drawn .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 12]: It was impossible to guess how the great news affected her .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 12]: The de la Veres were poor on two thousand a year .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 23]: What did it feel like to be the prospective bride of a millionaire , especially when you were -- what was it ?
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 9]: -- secretary to a man who collected beetles !
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 14]: `` Did Mr. Bower assign any reason for making that remarkable statement ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 5]: said Helen at last .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 24]: `` He explained that the fact -- I suppose it is a fact -- would safeguard you from the malice of an ex-coryphée .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 8]: Indeed , he put it more brutally .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 13]: He spoke of the ` slanderous malice of an ex-chorus girl . '
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 17]: The English term sounds a trifle harsher than the French , do n't you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 20]: It began to dawn on Helen that Mrs. de la Vere 's friendliness might have a somewhat sordid foundation .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 22]: Was she tending her merely to secure the freshest details of an affair that must be causing many tongues to wag ?
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 19]: `` I am acquiring new theories of life since I came to Maloja , '' she said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 23]: `` One would have thought that I might be the first person to be made aware of Mr. Bower 's intentions . ''
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 9]: `` Oh , this is really too funny .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 7]: May I light a cigarette ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 4]: `` Please do .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 20]: And now it is my turn to ask you to point out the exquisite humor of the situation . ''
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 10]: `` Do n't be vexed with me , child .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 36]: You need n't say another word if you do n't wish it ; but surely you are not annoyed because I have given you the tip as to what took place in the hall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 11]: `` You have been exceedingly good -- '' `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 4]: I have n't .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 23]: I was just as nasty as the others , and I sneered like the rest when Bower showed up a fortnight since .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 10]: I was wrong , and I apologize for it .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 8]: Regard me as in sackcloth and ashes .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 19]: But my heart went out to you when you dropped like a log among all those staring people .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 17]: I 've -- I 've done it myself , and my case was worse than yours .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 28]: Once in my life I loved a man , and I came home one day from the hunting field to read a telegram from the War Office .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 18]: He was ` missing , ' it said -- missing -- in a rear-guard action in Tirah .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 8]: Do you know what that means ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 19]: A cloud of smoke hid her face ; but it could not stifle the sob in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 8]: There was a knock at the door .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 8]: `` Are you there , Edith ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 6]: demanded Reginald de la Vere .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 3]: Go away !
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 5]: I 'm busy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 13]: `` But -- '' `` Go away , I tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 10]: Then she jerked a scornful hand toward the door .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 24]: `` Six months later I was married -- men who are missed among the Afridis do n't come back , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 13]: `` I 'm more sorry than I can put into words ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 3]: murmured Helen .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 12]: `` For goodness ' sake do n't let us grow sentimental .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 7]: Shall we return to our sheep ?
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 17]: Do n't be afraid that I shall pasture the goats in the hall on your confidences .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 7]: Has n't Bower asked you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 10]: `` Then his action was all the more generous .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 15]: He meant to squelch that friend of yours -- is she your friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 11]: `` She used to be , '' said Helen sadly .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 11]: `` And what do you mean to do about it ?
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 9]: You will marry Bower , of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 5]: Helen 's heart fluttered .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 8]: Her color rose in a sudden wave .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 13]: `` I -- I do n't think so , '' she breathed .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 5]: `` Do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 11]: Well , I like you the better for saying so .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 23]: I can picture myself putting the same questions to one of the Wragg girls -- to both of 'em , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 36]: I am older than you , and very much wiser in some of the world 's ways , and my advice is , Do n't marry any man unless you are sure you love him .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 17]: If you do love him , you may keep him , for men are patient creatures .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 8]: But that is for you to decide .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 7]: I ca n't help you there .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 31]: I am mainly concerned , for the moment , in helping you over the ice during the next day or two -- if you will let me , that is .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 11]: Probably you have determined not to appear in public to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 6]: That will be a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 12]: Wear your prettiest frock , and dine with Reggie and me .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 27]: We shall invite Mr. Bower to join us , and two other people -- some man and woman I can depend on to keep things going .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 32]: If we laugh and kick up no end of a noise , it will not only worry the remainder of the crowd , but you score heavily off the theatrical lady .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 3]: See ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 19]: `` I can see that you are acting the part of the good Samaritan , '' cried Helen .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 11]: `` Oh , dear , no -- nothing so antiquated .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 13]: Look at your future position -- the avowed wife of a millionaire .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 4]: Eh , what ?
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 5]: as Georgie says . ''
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 10]: `` But I am not anything of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 11]: Mr. Bower -- '' `` Mr. Bower is all right .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 31]: He has the recognized history of the man who makes a good husband , and you ca n't help liking him , unless -- unless there is another man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 13]: `` There , at least , I am -- '' Helen hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 13]: Something gripped her heart and checked the modest protestation of her freedom .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 6]: Mrs. de la Vere laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 28]: `` If you are not sure , you are safe , '' she said , with a hard ring in her utterance that belied her easygoing philosophy .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 11]: `` Really , you bring me back a lost decade .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 11]: Now , Helen -- may I call you Helen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 6]: `` Yes , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 14]: `` Well , then , do n't forget that my name is Edith .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 9]: You have just half an hour to dress .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 16]: I need every second of the time ; so off you run to your room .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 21]: As I hear Reggie flinging his boots around next door , I shall hurry him and arrange about the table .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 4]: Call for me .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 8]: We must go to the foyer together .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 10]: Now kiss me , there 's a dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 32]: Helen was wrestling with her refractory tresses -- for the coiffure that suits glaciers and Tam o'Shanters is not permissible in evening dress -- when a servant brought her a note .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 27]: `` DEAR MISS WYNTON , '' it ran , -- `` If you are able to come down to dinner , why not dine with me ?
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 8]: Sincerely , `` CHARLES K. SPENCER . ''
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 7]: She blushed and laughed a little .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 22]: `` I am in demand , '' she thought , flashing a pardonable glance at her own face in the mirror .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 7]: She read the brief invitation again .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 12]: Spencer had a trick of printing the K in his signature .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 5]: It caught her fancy .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 6]: It suggested strength , trustworthiness .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 30]: She did not know then that one of the shrewdest scoundrels in the Western States had already commented on certain qualities betokened by that letter in Spencer 's name .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 10]: `` I can not refuse , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 12]: `` To be candid , I do n't want to refuse .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 6]: What shall I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 31]: Bidding the servant wait , she twisted her hair into a coil , threw a wrap round her shoulders , and tapped on Mrs. de la Vere 's door . ''
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 3]: _ Entrez !
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 6]: _ '' cried that lady .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 13]: `` I am in a bit of difficulty , '' said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 10]: `` Mr. Spencer wishes me to dine with him .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 7]: Would you -- '' `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 8]: I 'll ask him to join us .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 6]: Reggie will see him too .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 8]: Really , Helen , this is amusing .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 8]: I am beginning to suspect you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 7]: So Spencer received a surprising answer .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 28]: He read it without any sign of the amusement Mrs. de la Vere extracted from the situation , for Helen took care to recite the whole arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 28]: `` I 'm going through with this , '' he growled savagely , `` even if I have to drink Bower 's health -- damn him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 36]: CHAPTER XII THE ALLIES Seldom , if ever , has a more strangely assorted party met at dinner than that which gathered in the Hotel Kursaal under the social wing of Mrs. de la Vere .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 17]: Her husband , while being coached in essentials , was the first to discover its incongruities .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 19]: `` Where Miss Wynton is concerned , you are warned off , '' his wife told him dryly .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 9]: `` You must console yourself with Mrs. Badminton-Smythe .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 14]: She will stand anything to cut out a younger and prettier woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 10]: `` Where do you come in , Edie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 43]: said he ; for Mrs. de la Vere 's delicate aristocratic beauty seemed to be the natural complement of her sporting style , and to-night there was a wistful charm in her face that the lively Reginald had not seen there before .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 10]: She turned aside , busying herself with her toilet .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 7]: `` I do n't come in .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 16]: I went out five years ago , '' she cried , with a mocking laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 24]: `` Do you know , '' he muttered , `` I often wonder why the deuce you an ' I got married . ''
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 17]: `` Because , sweet Reginald , we were made for each other by a wise Providence .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 15]: What other woman of your acquaintance would tolerate you -- as a husband ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 7]: `` Oh , dash it all !
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 22]: if it comes to that -- '' `` For goodness ' sake , do n't fuss , or begin to think .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 8]: Run away and interview the head waiter .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 10]: Then you are to buttonhole Bower and the American .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 11]: I am just sending a chit to the Badminton-Smythes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 7]: `` Who is my partner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 7]: `` Lulu , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 10]: De la Vere was puzzled , and looked it .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 12]: `` I suppose it is all right , '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 19]: `` Still , I ca n't help thinking you 've got something up your sleeve , Edie . ''
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 8]: She stamped a very pretty foot angrily .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 7]: `` Do as I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 8]: Did n't you hear what Bower said ?
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 16]: He will be everlastingly obliged to us for coming to the rescue in this fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 17]: Next time you have a flutter in the city , his friendship may be useful . ''
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 5]: `` By gad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 23]: cried Reginald , beginning , as he fancied , to see light , `` something seems to have bitten you this evening .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 9]: Tell you what -- Lulu is a non-runner .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 29]: Get Bower to put you on to a soft thing in Africans , an ' you an ' I will have a second honeymoon in Madeira next winter .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 3]: Honor bright !
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 5]: I mean it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 19]: She seized a silver mounted brush from the dressing table with the obvious intent of speeding his departure .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 10]: He dodged out , and strolled down the corridor .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 17]: `` Never saw Edie in that sort of tantrum before , '' he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 29]: `` If she only knew how sick I was of all this jolly rot , p ` r ` aps we 'd run better in double harness . ''
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 33]: So it came to pass , when the company assembled in the great dining room , that Bower sat on Mrs. de la Vere 's left , and Spencer on her right .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 23]: Beyond them , respectively , were Lulu Badminton-Smythe and her husband , and between these latter were de la Vere and Helen .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 30]: Thus , the girl was separated from the two men whom her shrewd eyed hostess had classed as rivals , while the round table made possible a general conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 13]: The talk could hardly fail to turn on the day 's adventures .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 24]: Spencer , who had never before in his life thrust himself forward in a social gathering , did so now with fixed purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 21]: He meant to eclipse Bower in a territory where that polished man of the world was accustomed to reign unchallenged .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 8]: But he had the wisdom to wait .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 31]: He guessed , not without good cause , that more than one late arrival would pause beside their table and make polite inquiries as to the climbers ' well being .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 11]: These interruptions were fatal to Bower 's well balanced periods .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 13]: The journey to the hut , therefore , was dealt with jerkily .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 17]: When Spencer took up the thread , he caught and held the attention of his hearers .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 11]: In this he was helped considerably by his quaint idioms .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 10]: To English ears , American expressions are always amusing .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 34]: Spencer , of course , could speak quite as correct English as anyone present ; but he realized that in this instance a certain amount of picturesque exaggeration would lend itself to humor .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 26]: His quick ear too had missed none of the queer mixture of prayers and objurgations with which Karl and the two guides hailed every incident .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 9]: His selections set them all in a roar .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 12]: In fact , they were the liveliest party in the room .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 22]: Many an eye was drawn by a merriment that offered such striking contrast to the dramatic episode in the outer hall .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 45]: `` The one person missing from that crowd is the stage lady , '' was Miss Gladys Wragg 's caustic comment , when Badminton-Smythe evoked a fresh outburst by protesting that he forgot to eat his fish owing to Spencer 's beastly funny yarn .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 8]: And Miss Wragg 's criticism was justified .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 36]: It only needed Millicent 's presence to add a wizard 's touch to the amazement with which Mrs. Vavasour and others of her kind regarded the defection of the de la Veres and the Badminton-Smythes .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 9]: But Millicent was dining in her own room .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 28]: The last thing she dreamed of was that Helen would face the other residents in the hotel after the ordeal she had gone through an hour earlier .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 17]: She half expected that Bower would endeavor to meet her privately while dinner was being served .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 6]: She was ready for him .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 32]: She prepared a number of sarcastic little speeches , each with a subtle venom of its own , and even rehearsed a pose or two with a view toward scenic effect .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 19]: But she had neither taken Bower 's measure nor counted on Mrs. de la Vere 's superior strategy .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 37]: All that happened was that she ate a lukewarm meal , and was left to wonder at her one-time admirer 's boldness in accepting a situation that many a daring man would have striven to evade .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 22]: After dinner it was the custom of the habitués to break up into small groups and arrange the night 's amusement .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 13]: Dancing claimed the younger element , while card games had their devotees .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 15]: Mrs. de la Vere danced invariably ; but to-night she devoted herself to Helen .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 6]: She was under no illusions .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 25]: Bower and Spencer were engaged in a quiet duel , and the victor meant to monopolize the girl for the remainder of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 4]: That was preventable .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 10]: They could fight their battle on some other occasion .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 43]: At present there was one thing of vital importance , -- the unpleasant impression created by the actress 's bitter attack must be dissipated , and Mrs. de la Vere , secretly marveling at her own enthusiasm , aimed at the achievement .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 30]: `` Do n't be drawn away from me on any pretext , '' she whispered , linking her arm through Helen 's as they passed out into the foyer .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 17]: `` And be gracious to everybody , even to those who have been most cattish . ''
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 11]: Helen was far too excited and grateful to harbor animosity .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 13]: Moreover , she dreaded the chance of being left alone with Bower .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 25]: As he had already declared his intentions publicly , she was sure he would seize the first opportunity to ask her to marry him .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 7]: And what would be her answer ?
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 4]: She hardly knew .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 7]: She must have time to think .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 7]: She must search her own heart .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 19]: She almost flinched from the succeeding thought , -- was it that her soul had found another mate ?
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 29]: If that was so , she must refuse Bower , though the man she was learning to love might pass out of her life and leave her desolate .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 8]: She liked Bower , even respected him .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 20]: Never for an instant had the notion intruded that he had followed her to Switzerland with an unworthy motive .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 13]: To her mind , nothing could be more straightforward than their acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 21]: The more she reflected on Millicent Jaques 's extraordinary conduct , the more she was astounded by its utter baselessness .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 8]: And Bower was admirable in many ways .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 10]: He stood high in the opinion of the world .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 16]: He was rich , cultured , and seemingly very deeply enamored of her undeserving self .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 8]: What better husband could any girl desire ?
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 11]: He would give her everything that made life worth living .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 14]: Indeed , if the truth must be told , she was phenomenally lucky .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 23]: Thus did she strive to silence misgivings , to quell doubt , to order and regulate a blurred medley of subconscious thought .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 58]: While laughing , and talking , and making the most successful efforts to be at ease with the dozens of people who came and spoke to Mrs. de la Vere and herself , she felt like some frail vessel dancing blithely in a swift , smooth current , yet hastening ever to the verge of a cataract .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 29]: Once Bower approached , skillfully piloting Mrs. Badminton-Smythe ; for Reginald , tiring of the rôle thrust on him by his wife , had gone to play bridge .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 12]: It was his clear intent to take Helen from her chaperon .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 15]: `` It is still snowing , though not so heavily , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 12]: `` Come on the veranda , and look at the landscape .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 17]: The lake is a pool of ink in the middle of a white table cloth . ''
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 31]: `` The snow will be far more visible in the morning , and we have a lot of ice to melt here , '' interposed Mrs. de la Vere quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 22]: The man and woman , both well versed in the ways of society , looked each other squarely in the eye .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 11]: Though disappointed , the man understood , was even appreciative .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 21]: `` Miss Wynton is fortunate in her friends , '' he said , and straightway went to the writing room .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 11]: He felt that Helen was safe with this unexpected ally .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 8]: He could afford to bide his time .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 15]: Nothing could now undo the effect of his open declaration while flouting Millicent Jaques .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 22]: If he gave that wayward young person a passing thought , it was one of gladness that she had precipitated matters .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 12]: There remained only an unpleasant meeting with Stampa in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 18]: He shuddered at the recollection that he had nearly done a foolish thing while crossing the crevasse .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 17]: What sinister influence could have so weakened his nerve as to make him think of murder ?
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 9]: Crime was the last resource of impaired intellect .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 13]: He was able to laugh now at the stupid memory of it .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 26]: True , the American -- By the way , what did Millicent mean by her shrewish cry that Spencer was paying for Helen 's holiday ?
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 36]: So engrossed was he in other directions that his early doubts with regard to `` The Firefly 's '' unprecedented enterprise in sending a representative to this out-of-the-way Swiss valley had been lulled to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 17]: Of course , he had caused certain inquiries to be made -- that was his method .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 20]: One of the telegrams he dispatched from Zurich after Helen 's train bustled off to Coire started the investigation .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 22]: Thus far , a trusted clerk could only ascertain that the newspaper had undoubtedly commissioned the girl on the lines indicated .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 7]: Still , the point demanded attention .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 33]: He resolved to telegraph further instructions in the morning , with Spencer 's name added as a clew , though , to be sure , he was not done with Millicent yet .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 10]: He would reckon with her also on the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 15]: Perhaps , if he annoyed her sufficiently , she might explain that cryptic taunt .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 24]: Could he have seen a letter that was brought to Spencer 's room before dinner , the telegram would not have been written .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 12]: Mackenzie , rather incoherent with indignation , sent a hurried scrawl .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 19]: `` DEAR MR. SPENCER , '' it ran , -- `` A devil of a thing has happened .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 25]: To-day , '' the date being three days old , `` I went out to lunch , leaving a thick headed subeditor in charge .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 29]: I had not been gone ten minutes when a stage fairy , all frills and flounces , whisked into the office and asked for Miss Wynton 's address .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 5]: My assistant succumbed instantly .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 25]: He was nearly asphyxiated with joy at being permitted to entertain , not unawares , that angel of musical comedy , Miss Millicent Jaques .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 23]: His maundering excuse is that you yourself seemed to acknowledge Miss Jaques 's right to be acquainted with her friend 's whereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 32]: I have good reason to believe that the frail youth not only spoke of Maloja , but supplied such details as were known to him of your kindness in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 13]: I have cursed him extensively ; but that can make no amends .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 31]: At any rate , I feel that you should be told , and it only remains for me to express my lasting regret that the incident should have occurred . ''
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 24]: This letter , joined to certain lurid statements made by Stampa , had induced Spencer to accept Mrs. de la Vere 's invitation .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 22]: Little as he cared to dine in Bower 's company , it was due to Helen that he should not refuse .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 14]: He was entangled neck and heels in a net of his own contriving .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 18]: For very shame 's sake , he could not wriggle out , leaving Helen in the toils .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 11]: Surely there never was a day more crammed with contrarieties .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 16]: He witnessed his adversary 's rebuff , and put it down to its rightful cause .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 30]: No sooner had he discovered Mrs. de la Vere 's apparent motive in keeping the girl by her side , than he was buttonholed by the Rev. Philip Hare .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 39]: `` You know I am not an ardent admirer of Bower , '' said the cleric ; `` but I must admit that it was very manly of him to make that outspoken statement about Miss Wynton . ''
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 5]: `` What statement ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 3]: asked Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 7]: `` Ah , I had forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 8]: You were not present , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 25]: He made the other woman 's hysterical outburst supremely ridiculous by saying , in effect , that he meant to marry Miss Wynton . ''
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 8]: `` He said that , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 5]: He was quite emphatic .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 12]: I rebuked Miss Jaques myself , and he thanked me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 15]: `` Everything was nicely cut and dried in my absence , it seems . ''
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 25]: `` Well -- er -- '' `` The crowd evidently lost sight of the fact that I had carried off the prospective bride . ''
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 3]: `` N-no .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 8]: Miss Jaques called attention to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 13]: `` Guess her head is screwed on straight , _ padre _ .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 24]: She made a bad break in attacking Miss Wynton ; but when she set about Bower she was running on a strong scent .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 6]: Sit tight , Mr. Hare .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 26]: Do n't take sides , or whoop up the wrong spout , and you 'll see heaps of fun before you 're much older . ''
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 9]: Mightily incensed , the younger man turned away .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 11]: The vicar produced his handkerchief and trumpeted into it loudly .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 7]: `` God bless my soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 28]: he said , and repeated the pious wish , for he felt that it did him good , `` how does one whoop up the wrong spout ?
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 7]: And what happens if one does ?
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 9]: And how remarkably touchy everybody seems to be .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 20]: Next time I apply to the C.M.S. for an Alpine station , I shall stipulate for a low altitude .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 13]: I am sure this rarefied air is bad for the nerves . ''
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 24]: Nevertheless , Hare 's startling communication was the one thing needed to clear away the doubts that beset Spencer at the dinner table .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 41]: He had seen Mrs. de la Vere enter Helen 's bedroom when he left the girl in charge of a gesticulating maid ; but an act of womanly solicitude did not explain the friendship that sprang so suddenly into existence .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 25]: Now he understood , or thought he understood , which is a man 's way when he seeks to interpret a woman 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 16]: Mrs. de la Vere , like the rest , was dazzled by Bower 's wealth .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 28]: After ignoring Helen during the past fortnight , she was prepared to toady to her instantly in her new guise as the chosen bride of a millionaire .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 13]: The belief added fuel to the fire already raging in his breast .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 34]: There never was man more loyal to woman in his secret meditations than Spencer ; but his gorge rose at the sight of Helen 's winsome gratitude to one so unworthy of it .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 13]: With him , now as ever , to think was to act .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 36]: Watching his chance , he waylaid Helen when her vigilant chaperon was momentarily absorbed in a suggestion that private theatricals and the rehearsal of a minuet would relieve the general tedium while the snow held .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 13]: `` Spare me five minutes , Miss Wynton , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 9]: `` I want to tell you something . ''
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 14]: Mrs. de la Vere pirouetted round on him before the girl could answer .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 15]: `` Miss Wynton is just going to bed , '' she informed him graciously .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 11]: `` You know how tired she is , Mr. Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 8]: You must wait till the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 25]: `` I do n't feel like waiting ; but I promise to cut down my remarks to one minute -- by the clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 12]: He answered Mrs. de la Vere , but looked at Helen .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 13]: Her color rose and fell almost with each beat of her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 22]: She saw the steadfast purpose in his eyes , and shrank from the decision she would be called upon to make .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 21]: Hardly realizing what form the words took , she gave faint utterance to the first lucid idea that presented itself .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 17]: `` I think -- I must really -- go to my room , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 19]: `` You would n't -- like me -- to faint twice in one evening -- Mr. Spencer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 13]: It was an astonishing thing to say , the worst thing possible .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 13]: It betrayed an exact knowledge of his purpose in seeking this interview .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 8]: His eyes blazed with a quick light .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 10]: It seemed that he was answered before he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 5]: `` Not one second .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 6]: Go away , do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 16]: broke in Mrs. de la Vere , whisking Helen toward the elevator without further parley .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 24]: But she shot a glance at Spencer over her shoulder that he could not fail to interpret as a silent message of encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 11]: Forthwith he viewed her behavior from a more favorable standpoint .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 56]: `` Guess the feminine make-up is more complex than I counted on , '' he communed , as he bent over a table to find a match , that being a commonplace sort of action calculated to disarm suspicion , lest others might be observing him , and wondering why the women retired so promptly .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 24]: `` I like your American , my dear , '' said Mrs. de la Vere sympathetically , in the solitude of the corridor .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 4]: Helen was silent .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 19]: `` If you want to cry , do n't mind me , '' went on the kindly cynic .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 8]: `` I 'm coming in with you .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 18]: I 'll light up while you weep , and then you must tell me all about it .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 10]: That will do you a world of good . ''
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 8]: `` There 's n-n-nothing to tell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 3]: bleated Helen .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 7]: `` Oh yes , there is .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 15]: You silly child , to-morrow you will have to choose between those two men .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 5]: Which shall it be ?
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 13]: I said before dinner that I could n't help you to decide .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 5]: Perhaps I was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 7]: Anyhow , I 'll try . ''
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 33]: * * * * * At midnight the snow storm ceased , the wind died away , and the still air deposited its vapor on hills and valley in a hoar frost .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 12]: The sun rose with a magnificent disregard for yesterday 's riot .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 7]: Spencer 's room faced the southeast .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 19]: When the valet drew his blind in the morning the cold room was filled with a balmy warmth .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 26]: A glance through the window , however , dispelled a germ of hope that Helen and he might start on the promised walk to Vicosoprano .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 22]: The snow lay deep in the pass , and probably extended a mile or two down into the Vale of Bregaglia .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 17]: The rapid thaw that would set in during the forenoon might clear the roads before sunset .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 13]: Next day , walking would be practicable ; to-day it meant wading .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 22]: He looked through the Orlegna gorge , and caught the silvery sheen of the Cima di Rosso 's snow capped summit .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 6]: Hardly a rock was visible .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 11]: The gale had clothed each crag with a white shroud .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 15]: All day long the upper reaches of the glacier would be pelted by avalanches .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 27]: It struck him that an early stroll to the highest point of the path beyond Cavloccio might be rewarded with a distant view of several falls .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 32]: In any case , it provided an excellent pretext for securing Helen 's company , and he would have cheerfully suggested a trip in a balloon to attain the same object .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 16]: The temperature of his bath water induced doubts as to the imminence of the thaw .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 10]: Indeed , the air was bitterly cold as yet .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 10]: The snow lay closely on roads and meadow land .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 8]: It had the texture of fine powder .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 9]: Passing traffic left shallow , well defined marks .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 11]: A couple of stablemen swung their arms to restore circulation .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 11]: The breath of horses and cattle showed in dense clouds .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 22]: For once in his life the color of a tie and the style of his clothes became matters of serious import .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 12]: At first , he was blind to the humor of it .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 27]: He hesitated between the spruce tightness of a suit fashioned by a New York tailor and the more loosely designed garments he had purchased in London .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 6]: Then he laughed and reddened .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 21]: Flinging both aside , he chose the climber 's garb worn the previous day , and began to dress hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 6]: Therein he was well advised .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 8]: Nothing could better become his athletic figure .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 13]: He was that type of man who looks thinner when fully clothed .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 29]: He had never spared himself when asking others to work hard , and he received his guerdon now in a frame of iron and sinews of pliant steel .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 10]: Helen usually came down to breakfast at half-past eight .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 37]: She had the healthy British habit of beginning the day with a good meal , and Spencer indulged in the conceit that he might be favored with a tête-à-tête before they started for the projected walk .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 16]: Neither Bower nor Mrs. de la Vere ever put in an appearance at that hour .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 22]: Though Americans incline to the Continental manner of living , this true Westerner found himself a sudden convert to English methods .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 16]: In a word , he was in love , and his lady could not err .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 16]: To please her he was prepared to abjure iced water -- even to drink tea .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 16]: But , as often happens , his cheery mood was destined to end in disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 18]: He lingered a whole hour in the _ salle à manger _ , but Helen came not .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 7]: Then he rose in a panic .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 25]: What if she had breakfasted in her room , and was already basking in the sunlit veranda -- perhaps listening to Bower 's eloquence ?
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 11]: He rushed out so suddenly that his waiter was amazed .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 12]: Really , these Americans were incomprehensible -- weird as the English .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 16]: The two races dwelt far apart , but they moved in the same erratic orbit .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 24]: To the stolid German mind they were human comets , whose comings and goings were not to be gaged by any reasonable standard .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 10]: No , the veranda was empty -- to him .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 12]: Plenty of people greeted him ; but there was no Helen .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 11]: Ultimately he reflected that their appointment was for ten o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 10]: He calmed down , and a pipe became obvious .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 28]: He was enjoying that supremest delight of the smoker -- the first soothing whiffs of the day 's tobacco -- when a servant brought him a note .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 19]: The handwriting was strange to his eyes ; but a premonition told him that it was Helen 's .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 17]: Somehow , he expected that she would write in a clear , strong , legible way .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 5]: He was not mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 15]: She sent a friendly little message that she was devoting the morning to work .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 24]: The weather made it impossible to go to Vicosoprano , and in any event she did not feel equal to a long walk .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 20]: `` Yesterday 's events , '' she explained , `` took more out of me than I imagined . ''
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 13]: Well , she had been thinking of him , and that counted .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 34]: He was staring at the snow covered tennis courts , and wondering how soon the valley would regain its summer aspect , when Stampa limped into sight round the corner of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 18]: He stood at the foot of the broad flight of steps , as though waiting for someone .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 27]: Spencer was about to join him for a chat , when he recollected that Bower and the guide had an arrangement to meet in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 10]: With the memory came a queer jumble of impressions .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 42]: Stampa 's story , told overnight , was a sad one ; but the American was too fair minded to affect a moral detestation of Bower because of a piece of folly that wrecked a girl 's life sixteen years ago .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 29]: If the sins of a man 's youth were to shadow his whole life , then charity and regeneration must be cast out of the scheme of things .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 16]: Moreover , Bower 's version of the incident might put a new face on it .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 13]: There was no knowing how he too had been tempted and suffered .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 23]: That he raged against the resurrection of a bygone misdeed was shown by his mad impulse to kill Stampa on the glacier .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 48]: That such a man , strong in the power of his wealth and social position , should even dream of blotting out the past by a crime , offered the clearest proof of the frenzy that possessed him as soon as he recognized Etta Stampa 's father .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 18]: Not one word of his personal belief crossed Spencer 's lips during the talk with the guide .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 21]: Rather did he impress on his angry and vengeful hearer that a forgotten scandal should be left in its tomb .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 54]: He took this line , not that he posed as a moralist , but because he hated to acknowledge , even to himself , that he was helped in his wooing by Helen 's horror of his rival 's lapse from the standard every pure minded woman sets up in her ideal lover .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 14]: Ethically , he might be wrong ; in his conscience he was justified .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 29]: He had suffered too grievously from every species of intrigue and calumny during his own career not to be ultra-sensitive in regard to the use of such agents .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 29]: Yet , watching the bent and crippled old man waiting there in the snow , a sense of pity and mourning chilled his heart with ice cold touch .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 26]: `` If I were Stampa 's son , if that dead girl were my sister , how would _ I _ settle with Bower ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 11]: he asked , clenching his pipe firmly between his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 19]: `` Well , I could only ask God to be merciful both to him and to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 7]: `` Good gracious , Mr. Spencer !
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 10]: why that fierce gaze at our delightful valley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 9]: came the voice of Mrs. de la Vere .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 28]: `` I am glad none of us can give you the address of the Swiss clerk of the weather -- or you would surely slay him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 3]: He turned .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 15]: Convention demanded a smile and a polite greeting ; but Spencer was not conventional .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 17]: `` You are a thought reader , Mrs. de la Vere , '' he said . ''
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 14]: ` One of my many attractions , ' you should have added . ''
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 10]: `` I find this limpid light too critical . ''
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 19]: `` Oh , what a horrid thing to tell any woman , especially in the early morning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 16]: `` I have a wretched habit of putting the second part of a sentence first .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 13]: I really intended to say -- but it is too late . ''
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 19]: `` It is rather like swallowing the sugar coating after the pill ; but I 'll try . ''
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 16]: `` Well , then , this crystal atmosphere does not lend itself to the obvious .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 21]: If we were in London , I should catalogue your bewitchments lest you imagined I was blind to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 20]: `` That sounds nice , but -- '' `` It demands analysis , so I have failed doubly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 19]: `` I do n't feel up to talking like a character in one of Henry James 's novels .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 9]: And you were much more amusing last night .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 9]: Have you seen Miss Jaques this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 10]: That is , I do n't think so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 7]: `` Do you know her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 29]: `` It would be a kind thing if someone told her that there are other places in Switzerland where she will command the general admiration she deserves . ''
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 24]: `` I am inclined to believe that there is a man in the hotel who can put that notion before her delicately . ''
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 21]: Spencer possessed the unchanging gravity of expression that the whole American race seems to have borrowed from the Red Indian .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 13]: Mrs. de la Vere 's eyes twinkled as she gazed at him .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 15]: `` You did n't hear what was said last night , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 23]: `` Where Millicent Jaques is concerned , delicacy is absent from Mr. Bower 's make-up -- is that good New York ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 7]: `` It would be understood . ''
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 5]: This time he smiled .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 12]: Mrs. de la Vere wished to be a friend to Helen .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 9]: Whatsoever her motive , the wish was excellent .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 9]: `` You are severe , '' she pouted .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 15]: `` Of course I ought not to mimic you -- '' `` Pray do .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 10]: I had no idea I spoke so nicely . ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 5]: But I am serious .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 25]: I have espoused Miss Wynton 's cause , and there will be nothing but unhappiness for her while that other girl remains here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 19]: `` I hope you are mistaken , '' he said slowly , meeting her quizzing glance without flinching .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 21]: `` That is precisely where a woman 's point of view differs from a man 's , '' she countered .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 13]: `` In our lives we are swayed by things that men despise .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 9]: We are conscious of sidelong looks and whisperings .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 7]: We dread the finger of scorn .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 22]: When you have a wife , Mr. Spencer , you will begin to realize the limitations of the feminine horizon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 15]: `` Are you asking me to take this demonstrative young lady in hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 8]: `` I believe you would succeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 4]: Spencer smiled again .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 13]: He had not credited Mrs. de la Vere with such fine perceptiveness .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 23]: If her words meant anything , they implied an alliance , offensive and defensive , for Helen 's benefit and his own .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 29]: `` Guess we 'll leave it right there till I 've had a few words with Miss Wynton , '' he said , dropping suddenly into colloquial phrase .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 11]: `` A heart to heart talk , in fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 10]: She laughed pleasantly , and opened her cigarette case .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 31]: `` Tell you what , Mrs. de la Vere , '' he said , `` if ever you come to Colorado I shall hail you as a real cousin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 7]: Then a silence fell between them .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 8]: Bower was walking out of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 26]: He passed close in front of the glass partition , and might have seen them if his eyes were not as preoccupied as his mind .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 13]: But he was looking at Stampa , and frowning in deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 12]: The guide heard his slow , heavy tread , and turned .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 4]: The two met .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 26]: They exchanged no word , but went away together , the lame peasant hobbling along by the side of the tall , well dressed plutocrat .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 5]: `` How odd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 6]: said Mrs. de la Vere .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 6]: `` How exceedingly odd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 13]: CHAPTER XIII THE COMPACT `` Now , what have you to say ?
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 8]: We are safe from meddlers here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 4]: Bower spoke curtly .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 22]: Stampa and he were halfway across the narrow strip of undulating meadow land which shut off the hotel from the village .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 27]: They had followed the footpath , a busy thoroughfare bombarded with golf balls on fine mornings , but likely to be unfrequented till the snow melted .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 35]: Receiving no answer , Bower glanced sharply at his companion ; but the old guide might be unaware of his presence , so steadily did he trudge onward , with downcast , introspective eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 15]: Resolved to make an end of a silence that was irksome , Bower halted .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 12]: Then , for the first time , Stampa opened his lips .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 8]: `` Not here , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 4]: `` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 5]: We are alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 11]: `` You must come with me , Herr Baron . ''
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 8]: `` That is not my title . ''
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 6]: `` It used to be .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 10]: It will serve as well as any other . ''
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 10]: `` I refuse to stir a yard farther . ''
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 17]: `` Then , '' said Stampa , `` I will kill you where you stand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 11]: Neither in voice nor feature did he exhibit any emotion .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 14]: He merely put forward an all-sufficing reason , and left it at that .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 5]: Bower was no coward .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 25]: Though the curiously repressed manner of the threat sent a wave of blood from his face to his heart , he strode suddenly nearer .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 25]: Ready and eager to grapple with his adversary before a weapon could be drawn , he peered into the peasant 's care lined face .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 11]: `` So that is your plan , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 4]: he said thickly .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 23]: `` You would entice me to some lonely place , where you can shoot or stab me at your own good pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 2]: Fool !
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 25]: I can overpower you instantly , and have you sent to a jail or a lunatic asylum for the rest of your life . ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 22]: `` I carry no knife , nor can I use a pistol , Herr Baron , '' was the unruffled answer .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 7]: `` I do not need them .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 5]: My hands are enough .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 19]: You are a man , a big , strong man , with all a man 's worst passions .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 35]: Have you never felt that you could tear your enemy with your nails , choke him till the bones of his neck crackled , and his tongue lolled out like a panting dog 's ?
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 13]: That is how I too may feel if you deny my request .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 9]: And I will kill you , Marcus Bauer !
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 14]: As sure as God is in Heaven , I will kill you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 13]: Fear now lent its blind fury to the instinct of self preservation .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 14]: Bower leaped at Stampa , determined to master him at the first onslaught .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 15]: But he was heavy and slow , inert after long years of physical indolence .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 26]: The older man , awkward only because of his crippled leg , swung himself clear of Bower 's grip , and sprang out of reach .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 32]: `` If there be any who look , 't is you who risk imprisonment , '' he said calmly , with a touch of humor that assuredly he did not intend .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 9]: Bower knew then how greatly he had erred .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 25]: It was a mistake ever to have agreed to meet Stampa alone -- a much greater one not to have waited to be attacked .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 26]: As Stampa said truly , if anyone in the village had seen his mad action , there would be testimony that he was the aggressor .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 18]: He frowned at Stampa in a bull-like rage , glowering at him in a frenzy of impotence .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 12]: This dour old man opposed a grim barrier to his hopes .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 39]: It was intolerable that he , Mark Bower the millionaire , a man who held within his grasp all that the material world has to give , should be standing there at the mercy of a Swiss peasant .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 21]: Throughout the dreary vigil of the night he had pondered this thing , and could find no loophole of escape .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 58]: The record of that accursed summer sixteen years ago was long since obliterated in the history of Marcus Bauer , the emotional youth who made love to a village belle in Zermatt , and posed as an Austrian baron among the English and Italians who at that time formed the select band of climbers in the Valais .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 23]: But the short-lived romance was dead and buried , and its memory brought the taste of Dead Sea ashes to the mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 8]: Marcus Bauer had become a naturalized Englishman .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 14]: The mock barony was replaced by a wealth that might buy real titles .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 24]: But the crime still lived , and woe to Mark Bower , the financial magnate , if it was brought home to him !
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 11]: He had not risen above his fellows without making enemies .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 38]: He well knew the weakness and the strength of the British social system , with its strange complacency , its `` allowances , '' its hysterical prudery , its queer amalgam of Puritanism and light hearted forbearance .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 23]: He might gamble with loaded dice in the City , and people would applaud him as cleverer and shrewder than his opponents .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 19]: His name might be coupled with that of a pretty actress , and people would only smile knowingly .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 55]: But let a hint of his betrayal of Etta Stampa and its attendant circumstances reach the ears of those who hated him , and he would sink forthwith into the slough of rich parvenus who eke out their lives in vain efforts to enter the closely guarded circle from which he had been expelled .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 14]: If that was the only danger , he might meet and vanquish it .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 25]: The unscrupulous use of money , backed up by the law of libel , can do a great deal to still the public conscience .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 10]: There was another , more subtle and heart searching .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 9]: He was genuinely in love with Helen Wynton .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 17]: He had reached an age when position and power were more gratifying than mere gilded Bohemianism .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 19]: He could enter Parliament either by way of Palace Yard or through the portals of the Upper House .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 26]: He owned estates in Scotland and the home counties , and his Park Lane mansion figured already in the address books of half the peerage .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 70]: It pleased him to think that in placing a charming and gracious woman like Helen at the head of his household , she would look to him as the lodestar of her existence , and not tolerate him with the well-bred hauteur of one of the many aristocratic young women who were ready enough to marry him , but who , in their heart of hearts , despised him .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 10]: He had deliberately avoided that sort of matrimonial blunder .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 7]: It promised more than it fulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 17]: He refused to wed a woman who deemed her social rank dearly bartered for his money .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 56]: Yet , before ever the question arose , he knew quite well that this girl whom he had chosen -- the poorly paid secretary of some harmless enthusiast , the strangely selected correspondent of an insignificant journal -- would spurn him with scorn if she heard the story Stampa might tell of his lost daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 38]: That was the wildest absurdity in the mad jumble of events which brought him here face to face with a broken and frayed old man , -- one whom he had never seen before the previous day .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 50]: It was of a piece with this fantasy that he should be standing ankle deep in snow under the brilliant sun of August , and in risk , if not in fear , of his life within two hundred yards of a crowded hotel and a placid Swiss village .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 11]: His usually well ordered brain rebelled against these manifest incongruities .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 11]: His passion subsided almost as quickly as it had arisen .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 20]: He moistened his cold lips with his tongue , and the action seemed to restore his power of speech .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 12]: `` I suppose you have some motive in bringing me here .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 8]: `` You must come to the cemetery .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 6]: It is not far . ''
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 9]: This unlooked for reply struck a new note .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 11]: It had such a bizarre effect that Bower actually laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 8]: `` Then you really are mad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 4]: he guffawed harshly .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 7]: `` No , not at all .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 33]: I was on the verge of madness the other day ; but I was pulled back in time , thanks to the Madonna , else I might never have met you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 22]: `` Do you expect me to walk quietly to the burial ground in order that I may be slaughtered conveniently ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 16]: `` I am not going to kill you , Marcus Bauer , '' said Stampa .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 16]: `` I trust the good God will enable me to keep my hands off you .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 10]: He will punish you in His own good time .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 7]: You are safe from me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 9]: `` A moment ago you spoke differently . ''
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 13]: `` Ah , that was because you refused to come with me .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 17]: Assuredly I shall bring either you or your lying tongue to Etta 's grave this morning .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 6]: But you will come now .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 7]: You are afraid , Herr Baron .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 24]: I see it in your eyes , and you value that well-fed body of yours too highly not to do as I demand .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 25]: Believe me , within the next few minutes you shall either kneel by my little girl 's grave or tumble into your own . ''
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 8]: `` I am not afraid , Stampa .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 14]: I warn you again that I am more than a match for you .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 19]: Yet I would willingly make any reparation within my power for the wrong I have done you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 18]: `` Yes , yes -- that is all I ask -- reparation , such as it is .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 7]: Not to me -- to Etta .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 3]: Come then .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 8]: I have no weapon , I repeat .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 19]: You trust to your size and strength ; so , by your own showing , you are safe .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 6]: But you must come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 10]: A gleam of confidence crept into Bower 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 10]: Was it not wise to humor this old madman ?
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 23]: Perhaps , by displaying a remorse that was not all acting , he might arrange a truce , secure a breathing space .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 10]: He would be free to deal with Millicent Jaques .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 23]: He might so contrive matters that Helen should be far removed from Stampa 's dangerous presence before the threatened disclosure was made .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 13]: Yes , a wary prudence in speech and action might accomplish much .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 11]: Surely he dared match his brain against a peasant 's .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 14]: `` Very well , '' he said , `` I shall accompany you .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 27]: But remember , at the least sign of violence , I shall not only defend myself , but drag you off to the communal guardhouse . ''
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 13]: Without any answer , Stampa resumed his steady plodding through the snow .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 8]: Bower followed , somewhat in the rear .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 8]: He glanced sharply back toward the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 18]: So far as he could judge , no one had witnessed that frantic spring at his tormentor .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 14]: At that hour , nearly every resident would be on the sunlit veranda .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 12]: He wondered whether or not Helen and Millicent had met again .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 10]: He wished now he had interviewed Millicent last night .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 13]: Her problem was simple enough , -- a mere question of terms .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 28]: Spite had carried her boldly through the scene in the foyer ; but she was far too sensible a young woman to persist in a hopeless quarrel .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 32]: It was one of the fatalities that dogged his footsteps ever since he came to Maloja that the only person watching him at the moment should happen to be Millicent herself .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 23]: Her room was situated at the back of the hotel , and she had fallen asleep after many hours of restless thought .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 20]: When the clang of a bell woke her with a start she found that the morning was far advanced .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 20]: She dressed hurriedly , rather in a panic lest her quarry might have evaded her by an early flight .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 12]: The fine panorama of the Italian Alps naturally attracted her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 25]: She was staring at it idly , when she saw Bower and Stampa crossing the open space in front of her bed room window .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 10]: Stampa , of course , was unknown to her .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 17]: In some indefinable way his presence chimed with her fear that Bower would leave Maloja forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 13]: Did he intend to post through the Vale of Bregaglia to Chiavenna ?
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 14]: Then , indeed , she might be called on to overcome unforeseen difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 15]: She appreciated his character to the point of believing that Helen was his dupe .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 16]: She regretted now that she was so foolish as to attack her one-time friend openly .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 25]: Far better have asked Helen to visit her privately , and endeavor to find out exactly how the land lay before she encountered Bower .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 22]: At any rate , she ought to learn without delay whether or not he was hiring post horses in the village .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 20]: If so , he was unwilling to meet her , and the battle royal must take place in London .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 8]: A maid entered with coffee and rolls .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 11]: `` Who is that man with the English monsieur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 8]: inquired Millicent , pointing to the two .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 13]: The servant was a St. Moritz girl , and a glance sufficed .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 3]: `` That ?
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 7]: He is Christian Stampa , madam .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 16]: He used to drive one of Joos 's carriages ; but he had a misfortune .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 19]: He nearly killed a lady whom he was bringing to the hotel , and was dismissed in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 9]: Now he is guide to an American gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 3]: My God !
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 9]: but they are droll , the Americans ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 15]: The maid laughed , and created a clatter with basin and hot water can .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 15]: Millicent , forcing herself to eat quickly , continued to gaze after the pair .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 9]: The description of Stampa 's employer interested her .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 11]: His drollery evidently consisted in hiring a cripple as guide .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 11]: `` Is the American monsieur named Charles K. Spencer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 7]: she said , speaking very clearly .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 8]: `` I do not know , madam .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 13]: But Marie , who is on the second , can tell me .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 5]: Shall I ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 6]: `` Do , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 4]: Léontine bustled out .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 23]: Just then Millicent was amazed by Bower 's extraordinary leap at Stampa and the guide 's agile avoidance of his would-be assailant .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 23]: The men faced each other as though a fight was imminent ; but the upshot was that they walked on together quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 29]: Be sure that two keen blue eyes watched their every motion thenceforth , never leaving them till they entered the village street and disappeared behind a large chalet .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 8]: `` And what did it all mean ?
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 9]: Mark Bower -- scuffling with a villager ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 9]: Millicent 's smooth forehead wrinkled in earnest thought .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 21]: How queer it would be if Bower was trying to force Spencer 's guide into the commission of a crime !
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 6]: He would stop at nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 17]: He believed he could bend all men , and all women too , to his will .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 7]: Was he angered by unexpected resistance ?
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 10]: She hoped the maid would hurry with her news .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 26]: Though she meant to go at once to the village , it would be a point gained if she was certain of Stampa 's identity .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 10]: She was already veiled and befurred when Léontine returned .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 9]: Yes , Marie had given her full information .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 27]: Madam had heard , perhaps , how Herr Bower and the pretty English mademoiselle were in danger of being snowed up in the Forno hut yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 18]: Well , Stampa had gone with his _ voyageur _ , Monsieur Spensare , to their rescue .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 19]: And the young lady was the one whom Stampa had endangered during his career as a cab driver .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 6]: Again , it was droll .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 3]: Millicent agreed .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 15]: For the second time , she resolved to postpone her journey to St. Moritz .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 17]: * * * * * Bower was surprised when Stampa led him into the main road .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 24]: Having never seen any sign of a cemetery at Maloja , he guessed vaguely that it must be situated close to the church .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 10]: Therein , in a sense , he was right .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 24]: It will be remembered how Helen 's solitary ramble on the morning after her arrival in Maloja brought her to the secluded graveyard .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 29]: She first visited the little Swiss tabernacle which had attracted her curiosity , and thence took the priest 's path to the last resting place of his flock .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 11]: But Stampa had a purpose in following a circuitous route .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 25]: He turned sharply round the base of a huge pile of logs , stacked there in readiness for the fires of a long winter .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 4]: `` Look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 16]: he said , throwing open the half door of a cattle shed behind the timber .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 24]: `` They found her here on the second of August , a Sunday morning , just before the people went to early mass .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 11]: By her side was a bottle labeled ` Poison . '
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 11]: She bought it in Zermatt on the sixth of July .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 18]: So , you see , my little girl had been thinking a whole month of killing herself .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 3]: Poor child !
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 4]: What a month !
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 17]: They tell me , Herr Baron , you left Zermatt on the sixth of July ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 15]: Bower 's face had grown cold and gray while the old man was speaking .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 5]: He began to understand .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 28]: Stampa would spare him none of the horror of the tragedy from which he fled like a lost soul when the news of it reached the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 9]: Well , he would not draw back now .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 15]: If Stampa and he were destined to have a settlement , why defer it ?
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 37]: This was his day of reckoning , -- of atonement , he hoped , -- and he would not shirk the ordeal , though his flesh quivered and his humbled pride lashed him like a whip .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 7]: The squalid stable was peculiarly offensive .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 23]: Owing to the gale , the cattle that ought to be pasturing in the high alp were crowded there in reeking filth .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 37]: Yesterday , not long before this hour , he was humming verses of cow songs to Helen , and beguiling the way to the Forno with a recital of the customs and idyls of the hills .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 7]: What a spiteful thing was Fate !
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 20]: Why had this doting peasant risen from the dead to drag him through the mire of a past transgression ?
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 35]: If Stampa betrayed anger , if his eyes and voice showed the scorn and hatred of a man justly incensed because of his daughter 's untimely death , the situation would be more tolerable .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 15]: But his words were mild , biting only by reason of their simple pathos .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 7]: He spoke in a detached manner .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 19]: He might be relating the unhappy story of some village maid of whom he had no personal knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 10]: This complete self effacement grated on Bower 's nerves .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 9]: It almost spurred him again to ungovernable rage .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 10]: But he realized the paramount need of self control .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 14]: He clenched his teeth in the effort to bear his punishment without protest .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 10]: And Stampa seemed to have the gift of divination .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 6]: He read Bower 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 20]: By some means he became aware that the unsavory shed was loathsome to the fine gentleman standing beside him .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 28]: `` Etta was always so neat in her dress that it must have been a dreadful thing to see her laid there , '' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 8]: `` She fell just inside the door .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 17]: Before she drank the poison she must have looked once at the top of old Corvatsch .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 28]: She thought of me , I am sure , for she had my letter in her pocket telling her that I was at Pontresina with my voyageurs .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 17]: And she would think of you too , -- her lover , her promised husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 5]: Bower cleared his throat .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 15]: He tried to frame a denial ; but Stampa waved the unspoken thought aside .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 14]: `` Surely you told her you would marry her , Herr Baron ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 4]: he said gently .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 23]: `` Was it not to implore you to keep your vow that she journeyed all the way from Zermatt to the Maloja ?
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 29]: She was but a child , an innocent and frightened child , and you should not have been so brutal when she came to you in the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 4]: Ah , well !
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 9]: It is all ended and done with now .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 26]: It is said the Madonna gives her most powerful aid to young girls who seek from her Son the mercy they were denied on earth .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 25]: And my Etta has been dead sixteen long years , -- long enough for her sin to be cleansed by the fire of Purgatory .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 19]: Perhaps to-day , when justice is done to her at last , she may be admitted to Paradise .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 4]: Who can tell ?
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 19]: I would ask the priest ; but he would bid me not question the ways of Providence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 7]: At last Bower found his voice .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 10]: `` Etta is at peace , '' he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 12]: `` We have suffered for our folly -- both of us .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 8]: I -- I could not marry her .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 5]: It was impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 30]: Stampa did look at him then , -- such a look as the old Roman may have cast on the man who caused him to slay his loved daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 14]: Yet , when he spoke , his words were measured , almost reverent .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 7]: `` Not impossible , Marcus Bower .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 17]: Nothing is impossible to God , and He ordained that you should marry my Etta . ''
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 19]: `` I tell you -- '' began Bower huskily ; but the other silenced him with a gesture .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 24]: `` They took her to the inn , -- they are kind people who live there , -- and someone telegraphed to me .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 11]: The news went to Zermatt , and back to Pontresina .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 11]: I was high up in the Bernina with my party .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 40]: But a friend found me , and I ran like a madman over ice and rock in the foolish belief that if only I held my little girl in my arms I should kiss her back to life again .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 8]: I took the line of a bird .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 40]: If I had crossed the Muretto , I should not be lame to-day ; but I took Corvatsch in my path , and I fell , and when I saw Etta 's grave the grass was growing on it .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 9]: The turf is sixteen years old now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 13]: Breaking off thus abruptly , he swung away into the open pasture .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 12]: Bower , heavy with wrath and care , strode close behind .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 28]: He strove to keep his brain intent on the one issue , -- to placate this sorrowing old man , to persuade him that silence was best .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 12]: Soon they reached a path that curved upward among stunted trees .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 14]: It ended at an iron gate in the center of a low wall .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 3]: Bower shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 8]: This , then , was the cemetery .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 39]: He had never noticed it , though in former years he could have drawn a map of the Maloja from memory , so familiar was he with every twist and turn of mountain , valley , and lake .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 12]: The sun was hot on that small , pine sheltered hillock .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 7]: The snow was beginning to melt .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 21]: It clogged their feet , and left green patches where their footprints would have been clearly marked an hour earlier .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 10]: And they were not the only visitors that day .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 16]: There were signs of one who had climbed the hill since the snow ceased falling .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 9]: Inside the wall the white covering lay deep .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 23]: Bower 's prominent eyes , searching everywhere with furtive horror , saw that a little space had been cleared in one corner .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 15]: The piled up snow was strewed with broken weeds and tufts of long grass .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 12]: It bore an uncanny resemblance to the edges of a grave .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 19]: He paused , irresolute , unnerved , yet desperately determined to fall in with Stampa 's strange mood .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 14]: `` There is nothing to fear , '' said the old man gently .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 6]: `` They brought her here .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 21]: You are not afraid -- you , who clasped her to your breast , and swore you loved her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 13]: Bower 's face , deathly pale before , flamed into sudden life .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 5]: The strain was unbearable .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 9]: He could feel his own heart beating violently .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 10]: `` What do you want me to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 4]: he almost shouted .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 5]: `` She is dead !
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 7]: My repentance is of no avail !
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 10]: Why are you torturing me in this manner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 7]: `` Softly , son-in-law , softly !
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 16]: You are disturbed , or you would see the hand of Providence in our meeting .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 6]: What could be better arranged ?
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 8]: You have returned after all these years .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 6]: It is not too late .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 7]: To-day you shall marry Etta ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 13]: Bower 's neck was purple above the line of his white collar .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 8]: The veins stood out on his temples .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 10]: He looked like one in the throes of apoplexy .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 6]: `` For Heaven 's sake !
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 6]: what do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 3]: he panted .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 8]: `` I mean just what I say .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 6]: This is your wedding day .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 7]: Your bride lies there , waiting .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 13]: Never did woman wait for her man so still and patient . ''
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 6]: `` Come away , Stampa !
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 8]: This thing must be dealt with reasonably .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 3]: Come away !
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 25]: Let us find some less mournful place , and I shall tell you -- '' `` Nay , even yet you do not understand .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 13]: Well , then , Marcus Bauer , hear me while you may .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 21]: I swear you shall marry my girl , if I have to recite the wedding prayers over your dead body .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 26]: I have petitioned the Madonna to spare me from becoming a murderer , and I give you this last chance of saving your dirty life .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 28]: Kneel there , by the side of the grave , and attend to the words that I shall read to you , or you must surely die !
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 9]: You came to Zermatt and chose my Etta .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 29]: Very well , if it be God 's will that she should be the wife of a scoundrel like you , it is not for me to resist .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 9]: Marry her you shall , here and now !
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 33]: I will bind you to her henceforth and for all eternity , and the time will come when her intercession may drag you back from the hell your cruel deed deserves . ''
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 27]: With a mighty effort , Bower regained the self-conceit that Stampa 's words , no less than the depressing environment , had shocked out of him .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 12]: The grotesque nature of the proposal was a tonic in itself .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 32]: `` If I had expected any such folly on your part , I should not have come with you , '' he said , speaking with something of his habitual dignity .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 6]: `` Your suggestion is monstrous .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 9]: How can I marry a dead woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 6]: Stampa 's expression changed instantly .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 11]: Its meek sorrow yielded to a ferocity that was appalling .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 15]: Already bent , he crouched like a wild beast gathering itself for an attack .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 6]: `` Do you refuse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 11]: he asked , in a low note of intense passion .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 6]: `` Yes , curse you !
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 9]: And mutter your prayers in your own behalf .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 17]: You need them more than I. '' Bower planted himself firmly , right in the gateway .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 18]: He clenched his fists , and savagely resolved to batter this lunatic 's face into a pulp .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 27]: He had a notion that Stampa would rush straight at him , and give him an opportunity to strike from the shoulder , hard and true .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 5]: He was bitterly undeceived .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 27]: The man who was nearly twenty years his senior jumped from the top of a low monument on to the flat coping stones of the wall .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 33]: From that greater height he leaped down on Bower , who struck out wildly , but without a tithe of the force needed to stop the impact of a heavily built adversary .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 24]: He had to change feet too , and he was borne to the earth by that catamount spring before he could avoid it .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 14]: For a few seconds the two writhed in the snow in deadly embrace .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 5]: Then Stampa remained uppermost .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 10]: He had pinned Bower to the ground face downward .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 42]: Kneeling on his shoulders , with the left hand gripping his neck and the right clutching his hair and scalp , he pulled back the wretched man 's head till it was a miracle that the spinal column was not broken .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 4]: `` Now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 9]: he growled , `` are you content ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 5]: There was no reply .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 10]: It was a physical impossibility that Bower should speak .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 25]: Even in his tempest of rage Stampa realized this , and loosened his grip sufficiently to give his opponent a moment of precious breath .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 4]: `` Answer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 4]: he muttered again .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 16]: `` Promise you will obey , you brute , or I crack your neck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 11]: Bower gurgled something that sounded like an appeal for mercy .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 27]: Stampa rose at once , but took the precaution to close the gate , since they had rolled into the cemetery during their short fight . ''
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 3]: _ Saperlotte !
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 21]: _ '' he cried , `` you are not the first who deemed me helpless because of my crooked leg .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 16]: You might have run from me , Marcus Bauer ; you could never fight me .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 26]: Were I at death 's door , I would still have strength left to throttle you if once my fingers closed round your throat . ''
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 8]: Bower raised himself on hands and knees .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 15]: He cut an abject figure ; but he was beyond all thought of appearances .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 12]: For one dread moment his life had trembled in the balance .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 13]: That glimpse of death and of the gloomy path beyond was affrighting .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 9]: He would do anything now to gain time .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 32]: Wealth , fame , love itself , what were they , each and all , when viewed from the threshold of that barrier which admits a man once and for ever ?
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 10]: In deep , laboring gasps his breath came back .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 9]: The blood coursed freely again in his veins .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 13]: He lived -- ah , that was everything -- he still lived !
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 17]: He scrambled to his feet , bare headed , yellow skinned , dazed , and trembling .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 10]: His eyes dwelt on Stampa with a new timidity .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 8]: He found difficulty in straightening his limbs .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 9]: He was quite insensible of his ridiculous aspect .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 13]: His clothing , even his hair , was matted with soft snow .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 14]: In a curiously servile way , he stooped to pick up his cap .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 19]: Stampa lurched toward the tiny patch of grass from which he had cleared the snow soon after daybreak .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 8]: `` Kneel here at her feet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 10]: Bower approached , with a slow , dragging movement .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 12]: Without a word of protest , he sank to his knees .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 9]: The snow in his hair began to melt .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 15]: He passed his hands over his face as though shutting out some horrific vision .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 20]: Stampa produced from his pocket a frayed and tattered prayer book -- an Italian edition of the Paroissien Romain .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 16]: He opened it at a marked page , and began to read the marriage ritual .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 29]: Though the words were Latin , and he was no better educated than any other peasant in the district , he pronounced the sonorous phrases with extraordinary accuracy .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 31]: Of course , he was an Italian , and Latin was not such an incomprehensible tongue to him as it would prove to a German or Englishman of his class .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 21]: Moreover , the liturgy of the Church of Rome is familiar to its people , no matter what their race .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 35]: Bower , stupefied and benumbed , though the sun was shining brilliantly , and a constant dripping from the pine branches gave proof of a rapid thaw , listened like one in a trance .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 13]: He understood scattered sentences , brokenly , yet with sufficient comprehension . ''
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 32]: _ Confiteor Deo omnipotenti _ , '' mumbled Stampa , and the bridegroom in this strange rite knew that he was making the profession of a faith he did not share .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 6]: His mind cleared by degrees .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 27]: He was still under the spell of bodily fear , but his brain triumphed over physical stress , and bade him disregard these worn out shibboleths .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 10]: Nevertheless , the words had a tremendous significance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 35]: _ Pater noster qui es in coelis , sanctificetur nomen tuum ... dimitte nobis debita nostra sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris ... _ '' It was quite easy to follow their general drift .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 34]: Anyone who had ever recited the Lord 's Prayer in any language would realize that he was asking the Deity to forgive him his trespasses as he forgave those who trespassed against him .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 44]: And there came to the kneeling man a thrilling consciousness that Stampa was appealing for him in the name of the dead girl , the once blushing and timid maid whose bones were crumbling into dust beneath that coverlet of earth and herbage .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 12]: There could be no doubting the grim earnestness of the reader .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 24]: It mattered not a jot to Stampa that he was usurping the functions of the Church in an outlandish travesty of her ritual .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 38]: He was sustained by a fixed belief that the daughter so heartlessly reft from him was present in spirit , nay , more , that she was profoundly grateful for this belated sanctifying of an unhallowed love .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 12]: Bower 's feelings or convictions were not of the slightest consequence .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 20]: He owed it to Etta to make reparation , and the duty must be fulfilled to the utmost letter .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 10]: Strong man as he was , Bower nearly fainted .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 18]: He scarce had the faculty of speech when Stampa bade him make the necessary responses in Italian .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 4]: But he obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 23]: All the time the devilish conviction grew that if he persisted in this flummery he might emerge scatheless from a ghastly ordeal .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 22]: The punishment of publicity was the one thing he dreaded , and that might be avoided -- for Etta 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 19]: So he obeyed , with cunning pretense of grief , trying to veil the malevolence in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 39]: At last , when the solemn '' _ per omnia secula _ _ seculorum _ '' and a peaceful `` Amen '' announced the close of this amazing marriage service , Stampa looked fixedly at his supposed son-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 17]: `` Now , Marcus Bauer , '' he said , `` I have done with you .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 16]: See to it that you do not again break your plighted vows to my daughter !
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 5]: She is your wife .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 5]: You are her husband .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 7]: Not even death can divide you .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 3]: Go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 40]: His strong , splendidly molded face , massive and dignified , cast in lines that would have appealed to a sculptor who wished to limn the features of a patriarch of old , wore an aspect of settled calm .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 9]: He was at peace with all the world .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 6]: He had forgiven his enemy .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 5]: Bower rose again stiffly .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 18]: He would have spoken ; but Stampa now fell on his knees and began to pray silently .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 34]: So the millionaire , humbled again and terror stricken by the sinister significance of those concluding words , yet not daring to question them , crept out of the place of the dead .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 11]: As he staggered down the hillside he looked back once .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 15]: He had eyes only for the little iron gate , but Stampa came not .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 14]: Then he essayed to brush some of the clinging snow off his clothes .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 12]: He shook himself like a dog after a plunge into water .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 16]: In the distance he saw the hotel , with its promise of luxury and forgetfulness .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 28]: And he cursed Stampa with a bitter fury of emphasis , trying vainly to persuade himself that he had been the victim of a maniac 's delusion .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 30]: CHAPTER XIV WHEREIN MILLICENT ARMS FOR THE FRAY Millicent was wondering how she would fare in the deep snow in boots that were never built for such a test .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 24]: She was standing on the swept roadway between the hotel and the stables , and the tracks of her quarry were plainly visible .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 22]: But the hope of discovering some explanation of Bower 's queer behavior was more powerful than her dread of wet feet .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 19]: She was gathering her skirts daintily before taking the next step , when the two men suddenly reappeared .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 14]: They had left the village and were crossing the line of the path .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 13]: Shrinking back under cover of an empty wagon , she watched them .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 31]: Apparently they were heading for the Orlegna Gorge , and she scanned the ground eagerly to learn how she could manage to spy on them without being seen almost immediately .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 40]: Then she fell into the same error as Helen in believing that the winding carriage road to the church offered the nearest way to the clump of firs and azaleas by which Bower and Stampa would soon be hidden .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 21]: Three minutes ' sharp walking brought her to the church , but there the highway turned abruptly toward the village .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 36]: As one side of the small ravine faced south , the sun 's rays were beginning to have effect , and a narrow track , seemingly leading to the hill , was almost laid bare .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 22]: In any event , it must bring her near the point where the men vanished , so she went on breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 19]: Crossing the rivulet , already swollen with melting snow , she mounted the steps cut in the hillside .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 16]: It was heavy going in that thin air ; but she held to it determinedly .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 10]: Then she heard men 's voices raised in anger .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 4]: She recognized one .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 13]: Bower was speaking German , Stampa a mixture of German and Italian .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 30]: Millicent had a vague acquaintance with both languages ; but it was of the Ollendorf order , and did not avail her in understanding their rapid , excited words .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 23]: Soon there were other sounds , the animal cries , the sobs , the labored grunts of men engaged in deadly struggle .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 28]: Thoroughly alarmed , more willing to retreat than advance , she still clambered on , impelled by irresistible desire to find out what strange thing was happening .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 21]: At last , partly concealed by a dwarf fir , she could peer over a wall into the tiny cemetery .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 24]: She was too late to witness the actual fight ; but she saw Stampa spring upright , leaving his prostrate opponent apparently lifeless .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 5]: She was utterly frightened .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 5]: Fear rendered her mute .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 16]: To her startled eyes it seemed that Bower had been killed by the crippled man .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 12]: Soon that quite natural impression yielded to one of sustained astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 8]: Bower rose slowly , a sorry spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 39]: To her woman 's mind , unfamiliar with scenes of violence , it was surprising that he did not begin at once to beat the life out of the lame old peasant who had attacked him so viciously .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 46]: When Stampa closed the gate and motioned Bower to kneel , when the tall , powerfully built man knelt without protest , when the reading of the Latin service began , -- well , Millicent could never afterward find words to express her conflicting emotions .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 6]: But she did not move .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 28]: Crouching behind her protecting tree , guarding her very breath lest some involuntary cry should betray her presence , she watched the whole of the weird ceremonial .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 29]: She racked her brains to guess its meaning , strained her ears to catch a sentence that might be identified hereafter ; but she failed in both respects .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 47]: Of course , it was evident that someone was buried there , someone whose memory the wild looking villager held dear , someone whose grave he had forced Bower to visit , someone for whose sake he was ready to murder Bower if the occasion demanded .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 20]: So much was clear ; but the rest was blurred , a medley of incoherences , a waking nightmare .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 19]: Oddly enough , it never occurred to her that a woman might be lying in that dreary tenement .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 31]: Her first vague imagining suggested that Bower had committed a crime , killed a man , and that an avenger had dragged him to his victim 's last resting place .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 20]: That Stampa was laboriously plodding through the marriage ritual was a fantastic conceit of which she received no hint .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 11]: There was nothing to dissolve the mist in her mind .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 8]: She could only wait , and marvel .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 13]: As the strange scene drew to its close , she became calmer .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 14]: She reflected that some sort of registry would be kept of the graves .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 28]: A few dismal monuments , and two rows of little black wooden crosses that stuck up mournfully out of the snow , gave proof positive of that .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 5]: She counted the crosses .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 16]: Stampa was standing near the seventh from a tomb easily recognizable at some future time .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 7]: Bower faced it on his knees .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 48]: She could not see him distinctly , as he was hidden by the other man 's broad shoulders ; but she did not regret it , because the warm brown tints of her furs against the background of snow and foliage might warn him of her presence .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 10]: She thanked the kindly stars that brought her here .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 18]: No matter what turn events took now , she hoped to hold the whip hand over Bower .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 25]: There was a mystery to be cleared , of course ; but with such materials she could hardly fail to discover its true bearings .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 31]: So she watched , in tremulous patience , quick to note each movement of the actors in a drama the like to which she had never seen on the stage .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 6]: At last Bower slunk away .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 31]: She heard the crunching of his feet on the snow , and , when Stampa ceased his silent prayer , she expected that he would depart by the same path .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 14]: To her overwhelming dismay , he wheeled round and looked straight at her .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 12]: In reality his eyes were fixed on the hills behind her .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 8]: He was thinking of his unhappy daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 37]: The giant mass of Corvatsch was associated in his mind with the girl 's last glimpse of her beloved Switzerland , while on that same memorable day it threw its deep shadow over his own life .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 22]: He turned to the mountain to seek its testimony , -- as it were , to the consummation of a tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 7]: But Millicent could not know that .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 18]: Losing all command of herself , she shrieked in terror , and ran wildly among the trees .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 15]: She stumbled and fell before she had gone five yards over the rough ground .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 28]: Quite in a panic , confused and blinded with snow , she rose and ran again , only to find herself speeding back to the burial ground .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 13]: Then , in a very agony of distress , she stood still .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 18]: Stampa was looking at her , with mild surprise displayed in every line of his expressive features .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 12]: `` What are you afraid of , _ sigñorina _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 5]: he asked in Italian .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 15]: She half understood , but her tongue clove to the roof of her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 10]: Her terror was manifest , and he pitied her .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 7]: He repeated his question in German .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 22]: A child might have recognized that this man of the benignant face and kindly , sorrow laden eyes intended no evil .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 5]: `` I am sorry .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 14]: I beg your pardon , Herr Stampa , '' she managed to stammer .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 13]: `` Ah , you know me , then , _ sigñorina _ !
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 6]: But everybody knows old Stampa .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 7]: Have you lost your way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 15]: `` I was taking a little walk , and happened to approach the cemetery .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 22]: I saw -- '' `` There is nothing to interest you here , madam , and still less to cause fear .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 11]: But it is a sad place , at the best .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 4]: Follow that path .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 12]: It will lead you to the village or the hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 6]: Her fright was subsiding rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 10]: She deemed the opportunity too good to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 20]: If she could win his confidence , what an immense advantage it would be in her struggle against Bower !
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 24]: Summoning all her energies , and trying to remember some of the German sentences learned in her school days , she smiled wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 11]: `` You are in great trouble , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 10]: `` I suppose Herr Bower has injured you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 6]: Stampa glanced at her keenly .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 55]: He had the experience of sixty years of a busy life to help him in summing up those with whom he came in contact , and this beautiful , richly dressed woman did not appeal to his simple nature as did Helen when she surprised his grief on a morning not so long ago .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 40]: Moreover , the elegant stranger was little better than a spy , for none but a spy would have wandered among the rocks and shrubs in such weather , and he was in no mood to suffer her inquiries .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 21]: `` I am in no trouble , '' he said , `` and Herr Bauer has not injured me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 9]: `` But you fought , '' she persisted .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 8]: `` I thought you had killed him .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 6]: I almost wish you had .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 5]: I hate him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 10]: `` It is a bad thing to hate anyone .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 21]: I am three times your age ; so you may , or may not , regard my advice as excellent .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 22]: Come round by the corner of the wall , and you will reach the path without walking in the deep snow .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 6]: Good morning , madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 25]: He bowed with an ease that would have proclaimed his nationality if he had not been an Italian mountaineer in every poise and gesture .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 34]: Stooping to recover his Alpine hat , which was lying near the cross at the head of the grave , he passed out through the gate before Millicent was clear of the wall .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 27]: He made off with long , uneven , but rapid strides , leaving her hot with annoyance that a mere peasant should treat her so cavalierly .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 14]: Though she did not understand all he said , she grasped its purport .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 6]: But her soreness soon passed .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 25]: The great fact remained that she shared some secret with him and Bower , a secret of an importance she could not yet measure .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 32]: She was tempted to go inside the cemetery , and might have yielded to the impulse had not a load of snow suddenly tumbled off the broad fronds of a pine .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 9]: The incident set her heart beating furiously again .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 7]: How lonely was this remote hilltop !
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 11]: Even the glorious sunshine did not relieve its brooding silence .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 59]: Thus it came about that these three people went down into the valley , each within a short distance of the others , and Spencer saw them all from the high road , where he was questioning an official of the federal postoffice as to the method of booking seats in the banquette of the diligence from Vicosoprano .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 11]: That he was bewildered by the procession goes without saying .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 21]: Where had they been , and how in the name of wonder could the woman 's presence be accounted for ?
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 15]: The polite postmaster must have thought that the Englishman was very dense that morning .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 19]: Several times he explained fully that the two desired seats in the diligence must be reserved from Chiavenna .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 17]: As many times did Spencer repeat the information without in the least seeming to comprehend it .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 20]: He spoke with the detached air of a boy in the first form reciting the fifth proposition in Euclid .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 10]: At last the postmaster gave it up in despair .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 8]: `` You see that man there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 18]: he said to a keenly interested policeman when Spencer strolled away in the direction of the village .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 8]: `` He is of the most peculiar .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 7]: He talks German like a parrot .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 7]: He must be a rich American .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 10]: Perhaps he wants to buy a diligence . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 4]: _ Wer weiss ?
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 6]: _ '' said the other .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 8]: `` Money makes some folk mad . ''
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 30]: And , indeed , through Spencer 's brain was running a Bedlamite jingle , a triolet of which the dominant line was Bower , Stampa , and Millicent Jaques .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 11]: The meeting of Bower and Stampa was easy of explanation .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 23]: After the guide 's story of the previous evening , nothing but Stampa 's death or Bower 's flight could prevent it .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 18]: But the woman from the Wellington Theater , how had she come to know of their feud ?
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 19]: He was almost tempted to quote the only line of Molière ever heard beyond the shores of France .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 26]: Like every visitor to the Maloja , he was acquainted with each of its roads and footpaths except the identical one that these three descended .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 6]: Where did it lead to ?
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 16]: Before he quite realized what he was doing , he was walking up the hill .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 17]: In places where the sun had not yet caught the snow there was a significant trail .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 36]: Bower had come and gone once , Stampa , or some man wearing village-made boots , twice ; but the single track left by Millicent 's smart footwear added another perplexing item to the puzzle .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 43]: So he pressed on , and soon was gazing at the forlorn cemetery , with its signs of a furious struggle between the gateposts , the uncovered grave space , and Millicent 's track round two corners of the square built wall .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 12]: It was part of his life 's training to read signs .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 58]: The mining engineer who would hit on a six-inch lode in a mountain of granite must combine imagination with knowledge , and Spencer quickly made out something of the silent story , -- something , not all , but enough to send him in haste to the hotel by the way Millicent had arrived on the scene .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 20]: `` Guess there 's going to be a heap of trouble round here , '' he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 8]: `` Helen must be recalled to London .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 14]: It 's up to me to make the cable hot to Mackenzie . ''
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 29]: He had yet to learn that the storm which brought about a good deal of the preceding twenty-four hours ' excitement had not acted in any niggardly fashion .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 20]: It had laid low whole sections of the telegraph system on both sides of the pass during the night .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 9]: Gangs of men were busy repairing the wires .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 33]: Later in the day , said a civil spoken attendant at the _ bureau des postes _ , a notice would be exhibited stating the probable hour of the resumption of service .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 10]: `` Are the wires down beyond St. Moritz ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 3]: asked Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 26]: `` I can not give an assurance , '' said the clerk ; `` but these southwest gales usually do not affect the Albula Pass .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 21]: The road to St. Moritz is practicable , as this morning 's mail was only forty minutes behind time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 27]: Spencer ordered a carriage , wrote a telegram , and gave it to the driver , with orders to forward it from St. Moritz if possible .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 18]: And this was the text : `` MACKENZIE , ` FIREFLY ' OFFICE , FLEET-ST. , LONDON .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 11]: Wire Miss Wynton positive instructions to return to England immediately .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 7]: Say she is wanted at office .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 8]: I shall arrange matters before she arrives .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 4]: This is urgent .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 3]: SPENCER . ''
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 27]: A heavy weight gradually lifted off his shoulders as he watched the wheels of the vehicle churning up the brown snow broth along the valley road .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 11]: Within two hours his message would reach a telegraph office .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 8]: Two more would bring it to Mackenzie .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 26]: With reasonable luck , the line repairers would link Maloja to the outer world that afternoon , and Helen would hie homeward in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 33]: It was a pity that her holiday and his wooing should be interfered with ; but who could have foretold that Millicent Jaques would drop from the sky in that unheralded way ?
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 21]: Her probable interference in the quarrel between Stampa and Bower put Mrs. de la Vere 's suggestion out of court .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 27]: A woman bent on requiting a personal slight would never consent to forego such a chance of obtaining ample vengeance as Bower 's earlier history provided .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 25]: In any case , Spencer was sure that the sooner Helen and he were removed from their present environment the happier they would be .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 17]: He hoped most fervently that the course of events might be made smooth for their departure .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 12]: He cared not a jot for the tittle-tattle of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 32]: Let him but see Helen re-established in London , and it would not be his fault if they did not set forth on their honeymoon before the year was much older .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 8]: He disliked this secret plotting and contriving .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 14]: He adopted such methods only because they offered the surest road to success .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 53]: Were he to consult his own feelings , he would go straight to Helen , tell her how chance had conspired with vagrom fancy to bring them together , and ask her to believe , as all who love are ready to believe , that their union was predestined throughout the ages .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 21]: But he could not explain his presence in Switzerland without referring to Bower , and the task was eminently distasteful .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 18]: In all things concerning the future relations between Helen and himself , he was done with pretense .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 30]: If he could help it , her first visit to the Alps should not have its record darkened by the few miserable pages torn out of Bower 's life .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 11]: After many years the man 's sin had discovered him .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 18]: That which was then done in secret was now about to be shrieked aloud from the housetops .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 33]: `` Even the gods can not undo the past , '' said the old Greeks , and the stern dogma had lost nothing of its truth with the march of the centuries .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 10]: Indeed , Spencer regretted his rival 's threatened exposure .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 33]: If it lay in his power , he would prevent it : meanwhile , Helen must be snatched from the enduring knowledge of her innocent association with the offender and his pillory .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 8]: He set his mind on the achievement .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 18]: To succeed , he must monopolize her company until she quitted the hotel en route for London .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 12]: Then he thought of Mrs. de la Vere as a helper .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 13]: Her seeming shallowness , her glaring affectations , no longer deceived him .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 31]: The mask lifted for an instant by that backward glance as she convoyed Helen to her room the previous night had proved altogether ineffective since their talk on the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 32]: He did not stop to ask himself why such a woman , volatile , fickle , blown this way and that by social zephyrs , should champion the cause of romance .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 26]: He simply thanked Heaven for it , nor sought other explanation than was given by his unwavering belief in the essential nobility of her sex .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 5]: Therein he was right .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 42]: Had he trusted to her intuition , and told Millicent Jaques at the earliest possible moment exactly how matters stood between Helen and himself , it is only reasonable to suppose that the actress would have changed her plan of campaign .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 20]: She had no genuine antipathy toward Helen , whose engagement to Spencer would be her strongest weapon against Bower .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 64]: As matters stood , however , Helen was a stumbling block in her path , and her jealous rage was in process of being fanned to a passionate intensity , when Spencer , searching for Mrs. de la Vere , saw Millicent in the midst of a group composed of the Vavasours , mother and son , the General , and his daughters .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 15]: Mrs. de Courcy Vavasour was the evil spirit who brought about this sinister gathering .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 35]: She was awed by Bower , she would not risk a snubbing from Mrs. de la Vere , and she was exceedingly annoyed to think that Helen might yet topple her from her throne .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 12]: To one of her type this final consideration was peculiarly galling .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 17]: And the too susceptible Georgie would be quite safe with the lady from the Wellington Theater .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 20]: Mrs. Vavasour remembered the malice in Millicent 's fine eyes when she refused to quail before Bower 's wrath .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 19]: A hawk in pursuit of a plump pigeon would not turn aside to snap up an insignificant sparrow .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 19]: So , being well versed in the tactics of these social skirmishes , she sought Millicent 's acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 12]: The younger woman was ready to meet her more than halfway .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 12]: The hotel gossips were the very persons whose aid she needed .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 14]: A gracious smile and a pouting complaint against the weather were the preliminaries .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 17]: In two minutes they were discussing Helen , and General Wragg was drawn into their chat .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 12]: Georgie and the Misses Wragg , of course , came uninvited .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 14]: They scented scandal as jackals sniff the feast provided by the mightier beasts .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 27]: Millicent , really despising these people , but anxious to hear the story of Bower 's love making , made no secret of her own sorrows .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 14]: `` Miss Wynton was my friend , '' she said with ingenuous pathos .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 21]: `` She never met Mr. Bower until I introduced her to him a few days before she came to Switzerland .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 19]: You may guess what a shock it gave me when I heard that he had followed her here .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 34]: Even then , knowing how strangely coincidence works at times , I refused to believe that the man who was my promised husband would abandon me under the spell of a momentary infatuation .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 8]: For it can be nothing more . ''
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 6]: `` Are you sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 6]: asked the sympathetic Mrs. Vavasour .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 5]: `` By gad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 16]: growled Wragg , `` I 'm inclined to differ from you there , Miss Jaques .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 19]: When Bower turned up last week they met as very old friends , I can assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 11]: `` Obviously a prearranged affair , '' said Mrs. Vavasour .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 16]: `` None of us has had a look in since , '' grinned Georgie vacuously .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 27]: `` Even Reggie de la Vere , who is a deuce of a fellah with the girls , could not get within yards of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 9]: This remark found scant favor with his audience .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 24]: Miss Beryl Wragg , who had affected de la Vere 's company for want of an eligible bachelor , pursed her lips scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 12]: `` I can hardly agree with that , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 24]: `` Edith de la Vere may be a sport ; but she does n't exactly fling her husband at another woman 's head .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 22]: Anyhow , it was amazing bad form on her part to include Miss Wynton in her dinner party last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 6]: Millicent 's blue eyes snapped .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 11]: `` Did Helen Wynton dine in public yesterday evening ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 3]: she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 3]: `` Rather !
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 9]: Quite a lively crowd they were too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 3]: `` Indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 6]: Who were the others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 21]: `` Oh , the Badminton-Smythes , and the Bower man , and that American -- what 's his name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 5]: Then Millicent laughed shrilly .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 16]: She saw her chance of delivering a deadly stroke , and took it without mercy .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 4]: `` The American ?
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 2]: Spencer ?
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 5]: What a delightful mixture !
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 16]: Why , he is the very man who is paying Miss Wynton 's expenses . ''
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 7]: `` So you said last night .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 13]: A somewhat -- er -- dangerous statement , '' coughed the General .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 12]: `` Rather stiff , you know -- Eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 4]: put in Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 9]: His mother silenced him with a frosty glance .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 12]: `` Of course you have good reasons for saying that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 3]: she interposed .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 13]: Spencer passed at that instant , and there was a thrilling pause .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 14]: Millicent was well aware that every ear was alert to catch each syllable .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 11]: When she spoke , her words were clear and precise .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 22]: `` Naturally , one would not say such a thing about any girl without the utmost certainty , '' she purred .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 17]: `` Even then , there are circumstances under which one ought to try and forget it .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 45]: But , if it is a question as to my veracity in the matter , I can only assure you that Miss Wynton 's mission to Switzerland on behalf of ` The Firefly ' is a mere blind for Mr. Spencer 's extraordinary generosity .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 11]: He is acting through the paper , it is true .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 12]: But some of you must have seen ` The Firefly . '
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 36]: How could such a poor journal afford to pay a young lady one hundred pounds and give her a return ticket by the Engadine express for four silly articles on life in the High Alps ?
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 7]: Why , it is ludicrous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 32]: `` Pretty hot , I must admit , '' sniggered Georgie , thinking to make peace with Beryl Wragg ; but she seemed to find his humor not to her taste .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 22]: `` It is the kind of arrangement from which one draws one 's own conclusions , '' said Mrs. Vavasour blandly .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 12]: `` But , I say , does Bower know this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 8]: asked Wragg , swinging his eyeglasses nervously .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 33]: Though he dearly loved these carpet battles , he was chary of figuring in them , having been caught badly more than once between the upper and nether millstones of opposing facts .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 14]: `` You heard me tell him , '' was Millicent 's confident answer .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 16]: `` If he requires further information , I am here to give it to him .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 12]: Indeed , I have delayed my departure for that very reason .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 13]: By the way , General , do you know Switzerland well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 12]: `` Every hotel in the country , '' he boasted proudly .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 10]: `` I do n't quite mean in that sense .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 5]: Who are the authorities ?
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 26]: For instance , if I had a friend buried in the cemetery here , to whom should I apply for identification of the grave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 11]: The General screwed up his features into a judicial frown .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 25]: `` Well -- er -- I should go to the communal office in the village , if I were you , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 19]: Braving his mother 's possible displeasure , George de Courcy Vavasour asserted his manliness for Beryl 's benefit .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 11]: `` I know the right Johnny , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 16]: `` Let me take you to him , Miss Jaques -- Eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 7]: Millicent affected to consider the proposal .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 8]: She saw that Mrs. Vavasour was content .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 18]: `` It is very kind of you , '' she said , with her most charming smile .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 11]: `` Have we time to go there before lunch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 6]: `` Oh , loads . ''
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 8]: `` I am walking toward the village .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 7]: May I come with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 4]: asked Beryl Wragg .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 11]: `` That will be too delightful , '' said Millicent .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 20]: Georgie , feeling the claws beneath the velvet of Miss Wragg 's voice , could only suffer in silence .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 6]: The three went out together .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 49]: The two women did the talking , and Millicent soon discovered that Bower had unquestionably paid court to Helen from the first hour of his arrival in the Maloja , whereas Spencer seemed to be an utter stranger to her and to every other person in the place .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 15]: This statement offered a curious discrepancy to the story retailed by Mackenzie 's assistant .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 8]: But it strengthened her case against Helen .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 14]: She grew more determined than ever to go on to the bitter end .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 27]: A communal official raised no difficulty about giving the name of the occupant of the grave marked by the seventh cross from the tomb she described .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 14]: A child was buried there , a boy who died three years ago .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 22]: With Beryl Wragg 's assistance , she cross examined the man , but could not shake his faith in the register .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 8]: The parents still lived in the village .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 12]: The official knew them , and remembered the boy quite well .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 10]: He had contracted a fever , and died suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 4]: This was disappointing .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 15]: Millicent , prepared to hear of a tragedy , was confronted by the commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 14]: But the special imp that attends all mischief makers prompted her next question .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 11]: `` Do you know Christian Stampa , the guide ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 4]: The man grinned .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 7]: `` Yes , _ sigñora _ .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 17]: He has been on the road for years , ever since he lost his daughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 9]: `` Was he any relation to the boy ?
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 11]: What interest would he have in this particular grave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 9]: The custodian of parish records stroked his chin .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 10]: He took thought , and reached for another ledger .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 13]: He ran a finger through an index and turned up a page .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 6]: `` A strange thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 14]: `` Why , that is the very place where Etta Stampa is buried .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 25]: You see , _ sigñora _ , '' he explained , `` it is a small cemetery , and our people are poor . ''
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 3]: Etta Stampa !
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 5]: Was this the clew ?
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 5]: Millicent 's heart throbbed .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 12]: How stupid that she had not thought of a woman earlier !
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 8]: `` How old was Etta Stampa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 3]: she inquired .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 19]: `` Her age is given here as nineteen , _ sigñora _ ; but that is a guess .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 6]: It was a sad case .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 4]: She killed herself .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 5]: She came from Zermatt .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 22]: I have lived nearly all my life in this valley , and hers is the only suicide I can recall . ''
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 11]: `` Why did she kill herself , and when ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 26]: The official supplied the date ; but he had no knowledge of the affair beyond a village rumor that she had been crossed in love .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 21]: As for poor old Stampa , who met with an accident about the same time , he never mentioned her .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 23]: `` Stampa is the lame Johnny who went up the Forno yesterday , '' volunteered Georgie , when they quitted the office .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 20]: `` But , I say , Miss Jaques , his daughter could n't be a friend of yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 5]: Millicent did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 5]: She was thinking deeply .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 11]: Then she realized that Beryl Wragg was watching her intently .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 32]: `` No , '' she said , `` I did not mean to convey that she was my friend ; only that one whom I know well was interested in her .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 15]: Can you tell me how I can find out more of her history ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 13]: `` Some of the villagers may help , '' said Miss Wragg .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 6]: `` Shall we make inquiries ?
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 15]: It is marvelous how one comes across things in the most unlikely quarters . ''
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 28]: Vavasour , whose stroll with a pretty actress had resolved itself into a depressing quest into the records of the local cemetery , looked at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 10]: `` Time 's up , '' he announced firmly .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 25]: `` The luncheon gong will go in a minute or two , and this keen air makes one peckish -- Eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 26]: So Millicent returned to the hotel , and when she entered the dining room she saw Helen and Spencer sitting with the de la Veres .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 13]: Edith de la Vere stared at her in a particularly irritating way .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 34]: Cynical contempt , bored amusement , even a quizzical surprise that such a vulgar person could be so well dressed , were carried by wireless telegraphy from the one woman to the other .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 7]: Millicent countered with a studied indifference .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 20]: She gave her whole attention to the efforts of the head waiter to find a seat to her liking .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 8]: He offered her the choice between two .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 18]: With fine self control , she selected that which turned her back on Helen and her friends .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 11]: She had just taken her place when Bower came in .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 21]: He stopped near the door , and spoke to an under manager ; but his glance swept the crowded room .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 25]: Spencer and Helen happened to be almost facing him , and the girl was listening with a smile to something the American was saying .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 27]: But there was a conscious shyness in her eyes , a touch of color on her sun browned face , that revealed more than she imagined .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 11]: Bower , who looked ill and old , hesitated perceptibly .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 8]: Then he seemed to reach some decision .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 15]: He walked to Helen 's side , and bent over her with courteous solicitude .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 12]: `` I hope that I am forgiven , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 3]: She started .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 41]: She was so absorbed in Spencer 's talk , which dealt with nothing more noteworthy than the excursion down the Vale of Bregaglia , which he secretly hoped would be postponed , that she had not observed Bower 's approach .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 6]: `` Forgiven , Mr. Bower ?
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 4]: For what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 10]: she asked , blushing now for no assignable reason .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 11]: `` For yesterday 's fright , and its sequel . ''
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 7]: `` But I enjoyed it thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 13]: Please do n't think I am only a fair weather mountaineer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 9]: I am not likely to commit that mistake .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 16]: It was feminine spite , not elemental , that I fancied might have troubled you .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 10]: Now I am going to face the enemy alone .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 11]: Pity me , and please drink to my success . ''
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 37]: He favored Spencer and the de la Veres with a comprehensive nod , and turned away , well satisfied that he had claimed a condition of confidence , of mutual trust , between Helen and himself .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 15]: Millicent was reading the menu when she heard Bower 's voice at her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 10]: `` Good morning , Millicent , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 7]: `` Shall we declare a truce ?
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 7]: May I eat at your table ?
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 9]: That , at least , will be original .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 18]: Picture the amazement of the mob if the lion and the lamb split a small bottle . ''
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 13]: He was bold ; but chance had fenced her with triple brass .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 21]: `` I really do n't feel inclined to forgive you , '' she said , with a quite forgiving smile .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 4]: He sat down .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 10]: The two were watched with discreet stupefaction by many .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 10]: `` Never give rein to your emotions , Millicent .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 12]: You did so last night , and blundered badly in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 9]: Artifice is the truest art , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 19]: Let us , then , be unreal , and act as though we were the dearest friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 7]: `` We are , I imagine .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 8]: Self interest should keep us solid . ''
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 10]: Bower affected a momentary absorption in the wine list .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 11]: He gave his order , and the waiter left them .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 14]: `` Now , I want you to be good , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 15]: `` Put your cards on the table , and I will do the same .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 12]: Let us discuss matters without prejudice , as the lawyers say .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 46]: And , in the first instance , tell me exactly what you imply by the statement that Mr. Charles K. Spencer , of Denver , Colorado , as he appears in the hotel register , is responsible for Helen Wynton 's presence here to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 17]: CHAPTER XV A COWARD 'S VICTORY `` It is a queer story , '' said Bower .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 10]: `` Because it is true , '' retorted Millicent .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 16]: `` Yet she never set eyes on the man until she met him here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 11]: `` That is rather impossible , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 8]: `` It is a fact , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 42]: On the day I arrived in Maloja , a letter came from the editor of ` The Firefly , ' telling her that he had written to Spencer , whom he knew , and suggested that they should become acquainted . ''
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 12]: `` These things are easily managed , '' said Millicent airily .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 9]: `` I accept Miss Wynton 's version . ''
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 6]: Bower spoke with brutal frankness .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 12]: The morning 's tribulation had worn away some of the veneer .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 12]: He fully expected the girl to flare into ill suppressed rage .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 10]: Then he could deal with her as he liked .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 22]: He had not earned his repute in the city of London without revealing at times the innate savagery of his nature .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 21]: As soon as he had taunted his adversaries into a passion , he found the weak joints in their armor .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 9]: He was surprised now that Millicent should laugh .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 10]: If she was acting , she was acting well .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 19]: `` It is too funny for words to see you playing the trustful swain , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 13]: `` One necessarily believes the best of one 's future wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 9]: `` So you still keep up that pretense ?
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 22]: It was a good line in last night 's situation ; but it becomes farcical when applied to light comedy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 16]: `` I give you credit for sufficient wit to understand why I joined you here .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 6]: We can avoid unpleasant explanations .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 12]: I am prepared to bury the hatchet -- on terms . ''
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 4]: `` Terms ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 10]: You are a blackmailer , a somewhat dangerous one .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 24]: You tempt me to revise the wisest of La Rochefoucauld 's maxims , and say that every woman is at heart a snake .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 12]: You owe everything to me ; yet you are not content .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 14]: Without my help you would still be carrying a banner in the chorus .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 15]: Unless I continue my patronage , that is what you must go back to .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 13]: Do n't imagine that I am treating with you out of sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 16]: For Helen 's sake , for her sake only , I offer a settlement . ''
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 21]: Millicent 's eyes narrowed a little ; but she affected to admire the gleaming beads in a glass of champagne .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 8]: `` Pray continue , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 7]: `` Your views are interesting . ''
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 22]: There was some danger lest Bower should reverse his wonted procedure , and lose his own temper in this unequal duel .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 7]: They both spoke in low tones .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 13]: Anyone watching them would find the smiles of conventionality on their lips .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 13]: To all outward seeming , they were indulging in a friendly gossip .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 12]: `` Of course , you want money , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 11]: `` That is the be-all and end-all of your existence .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 54]: Write a letter to Miss Wynton apologizing for your conduct , take yourself away from here at three o'clock , and from St. Moritz by the next train , and I not only withdraw my threat to bar you in the profession but shall hand you a check for a thousand pounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 7]: Millicent pretended to consider his proposal .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 5]: She shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 15]: `` Not nearly enough , '' she said , with a sweetly deprecatory moue .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 8]: `` It is all you will get .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 13]: I repeat that I am doing this to spare Helen 's feelings .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 6]: Perhaps I am ill advised .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 17]: You have done your worst already , and it only remains for me to crush you .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 12]: But I stick to the bargain -- for five minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 6]: `` Dear , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 3]: she sighed .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 5]: `` Only five minutes ?
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 10]: Do you get rid of your troubles so quickly ?
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 19]: How nice to be a man , and to be able to settle matters with such promptitude . ''
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 12]: Bower was undeniably perplexed ; but he held to his line .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 9]: Unwavering tenacity of purpose was his chief characteristic .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 16]: `` Meanwhile , '' he said , `` let us talk of the weather . ''
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 6]: `` A most seasonable topic .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 17]: It was altogether novel this morning to wake and find the world covered with snow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 20]: `` If the Maloja is your world , you must have thought it rather chilling , '' he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 10]: `` Yes , cold , perhaps , but fascinating .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 6]: I went for a walk .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 19]: You see , I wanted to be alone , to think what I should do for the best .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 18]: A woman is so helpless when she has to fight a big , strong man like you .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 7]: Chance led me to the cemetery .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 8]: What an odd little place it is ?
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 10]: Would n't you hate to be buried there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 10]: It was now Millicent 's turn to be surprised .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 15]: Not by the slightest tremor did Bower betray the shock caused by her innuendo .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 10]: His nerves were proof against further assault that day .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 16]: Fear had conquered him for an instant when he looked into the gate of darkness .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 24]: With its passing from before his eyes , his intellect resumed its sway , and he weighed events by that nicely adjusted balance .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 16]: None but a man who greatly dared would be sitting opposite Millicent at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 11]: None but a fool would have failed to understand her .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 9]: But he gave no sign that he understood .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 15]: He refilled his glass , and emptied it with the gusto of a connoisseur .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 11]: `` That is a good wine , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 14]: `` Sometimes pints are better than quarts , although of the same vintage .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 9]: Waiter , another half bottle , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 13]: `` No more for me , of course , '' murmured Millicent .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 19]: `` I must keep my head clear , -- so much depends on the next five minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 8]: `` Three , to be exact . ''
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 12]: `` Ah , then , I must use them to advantage .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 11]: Shall I tell you more about my early stroll ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 9]: `` What time did you go out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 7]: `` Soon after ten o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 7]: `` You saw -- what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 14]: `` A most exciting struggle -- and -- what shall I call it ?
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 5]: -- a ceremony . ''
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 8]: Bower was silent for an appreciable time .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 8]: He watched a waiter uncorking the champagne .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 15]: When the bottle was placed on the table he pretended to read the label .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 16]: He was thinking that Stampa 's marriage service was not so futile , after all .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 8]: It had soon erected its first barrier .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 17]: Millicent , who had qualities rare in a woman , turned and looked at a clock .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 17]: Incidentally , she discovered that Spencer was devoting some attention to the proceedings at her table .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 5]: Still Bower remained silent .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 7]: She stole a glance at him .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 41]: She was conscious that an abiding dread was stealing into her heart ; but her stage training came to her aid , and she managed to say evenly : `` My little ramble does not appear to interest you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 8]: `` It does , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 14]: `` I have been arguing the pros and cons of a ticklish problem .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 7]: There are two courses to me .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 14]: I can either bribe you , or leave you to your own devices .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 10]: The latter method implies the interference of the police .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 4]: I dislike that .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 8]: Helen would certainly be opposed to it .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 16]: I make the one thousand into five ; but I want your answer now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 9]: `` I accept , '' she said instantly .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 8]: `` Ah , but you are trembling .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 17]: Queer , is n't it , how thin is the partition between affluence and a prison ?
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 20]: There are dozens of men who stand high in commercial circles in London who ought to be in jail .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 18]: There are quite as many convicts in Portland who reached penal servitude along precisely the same road .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 9]: That is the penalty of being found out .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 5]: Let me congratulate you .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 10]: And do try another glass of this excellent wine .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 18]: You need it , and you have to pack your belongings at once , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 5]: `` Thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 4]: Her eyes sparkled .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 9]: Her well modulated voice was hardly under control .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 24]: Five thousand pounds was a great deal of money ; but the tragedy of Etta Stampa 's life might have been worth more .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 9]: How could she find out the whole truth ?
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 9]: She must accomplish that , in some way .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 8]: Therein , however , she greatly miscalculated .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 10]: Bower divined her thought almost before it was formed .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 15]: `` For goodness ' sake , let us put things in plain English ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 22]: `` I am paying you handsomely to save the woman I am going to marry from some little suffering and heartache .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 5]: Perhaps it is unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 13]: Her fine nature might forgive a man a transgression of his youth .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 12]: At any rate , I avert the risk by this payment .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 9]: The check will be payable to you personally .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 16]: In other words , you must place it to your own account in your bank .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 21]: Any breach of our contract in letter or spirit during the next two days will be punished by its stoppage .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 48]: After that time , the remotest hint on your part of any scandalous knowledge affecting me , or Helen , or the causes which led to my present weakness in allowing you to blackmail me , will imply the immediate issue of a warrant for your arrest .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 10]: Need I explain the position at greater length ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 32]: `` No , '' said Millicent , who wished now that she had bitten off the end of her tongue before she vented her spleen to the Vavasours and the Wraggs .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 23]: `` On second thoughts , '' went on Bower unconcernedly , `` I forego the stipulation as to a letter of apology .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 9]: I do n't suppose Helen will value it .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 7]: Assuredly , I do not . ''
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 12]: The cheapening of her surrender stung more than she counted on .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 19]: `` I have tried to avoid the appearance of uncalled for rudeness to-day , '' she blurted out .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 5]: `` Well -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 9]: What is the number of your room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 4]: She told him .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 11]: `` I shall send the check to you at once .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 5]: Have you finished ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 15]: He accompanied her to the door , bowed her out , and came back .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 15]: Smiling affably , he pulled a chair to Mrs. de la Vere 's side .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 11]: `` I quite enjoyed my luncheon , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 26]: `` You all heard that stupid outburst of Millicent 's last night ; so there is no harm in telling you that she regrets it .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 8]: She is leaving the hotel forthwith . ''
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 4]: Helen rose suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 13]: `` She is one of my few friends , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 11]: `` I can not let her go in anger . ''
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 13]: `` She is unworthy of your friendship , '' exclaimed Bower sharply .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 11]: `` Take my advice and forget that she exists . ''
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 18]: `` You can not forget that anyone exists , or has existed , '' said Spencer quietly .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 3]: `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 4]: You too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 3]: said Bower .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 13]: His eyes sought the American 's , and flashed an unspoken challenge .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 13]: He felt that the world was a few hundred years too old .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 22]: There were historical precedents for settling affairs such as that now troubling him by means that would have appealed to him .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 11]: But he opposed no further hindrance to Helen 's departure .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 21]: Indeed , he perceived that her meeting with Millicent would provide in some sense a test of his own judgment .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 11]: He would soon learn whether or not money would prevail .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 21]: He waited a little while , and then sent his valet with the check and a request for an acknowledgment .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 18]: The man brought him a scribbled note : `` Was rather taken aback by appearance of H .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 11]: She says you told her I was leaving the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 10]: We fell on each other 's neck and wept .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 4]: Is that right ?
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 26]: M. J. '' He cut the end off a cigar , lit the paper with a match , and lit the cigar with the paper .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 6]: `` Five thousand pounds ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 5]: he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 13]: `` It is a lot of money to one who has none .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 20]: I remember the time when I would have sold my soul to the devil for half the amount . ''
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 8]: But that was not a pleasing notion .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 29]: It suggested that , by evil hazard , some such contract had , in fact , been made , but forgotten by one of the parties to it .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 5]: So he dismissed it .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 25]: Having disposed of Stampa and Millicent , practically between breakfast and lunch , there were no reasons why he should trouble further about them .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 7]: The American threatened a fresh obstacle .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 11]: He was winning his way with Helen altogether too rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 24]: In the light of those ominous words at the luncheon table his close association with Stampa indicated a definite knowledge of the past .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 3]: Curse him !
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 5]: Why did he interfere ?
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 7]: Bower was eminently a selfish man .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 27]: He had enjoyed unchecked success for so long a time that he railed now at the series of mischances that tripped the feet of his desires .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 19]: Looking back through recent days , he was astonished to find how often Spencer had crossed his path .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 24]: Before he was four hours in Maloja , Helen , in his hearing , had singled out the American for conjecture and scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 31]: Then Dunston spoke of the same man as an eager adversary at baccarat ; but the promised game was arranged without Spencer 's coöperation , greatly to Dunston 's loss .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 12]: A man did not act in such fashion without some motive .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 4]: What was it ?
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 16]: This reserved , somewhat contemptuous rival had also snatched Helen from his company many times .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 29]: He had undoubtedly rendered some service in coming to the Forno hut ; but Bower 's own lapse from sanity on that occasion did not escape his notice .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 28]: Finally , this cool mannered , alert youngster from the New World did not seem to care a fig for any prior claim on Helen 's affections .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 25]: His whole attitude might be explained by the fact that he was Stampa 's employer , and had won the old guide 's confidence .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 9]: Yes , the American was the real danger .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 24]: That pale ghost conjured from the grave by Stampa was intangible , powerless , a dreamlike wraith evoked by a madman 's fancy .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 15]: Already the fear engendered myopia of the morning was passing from Bower 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 11]: The passage of arms with Millicent had done him good .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 16]: He saw now that if he meant to win Helen he must fight for her .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 16]: Glancing at his watch , he found that the time was a quarter to three .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 19]: He opened a window in his sitting room , which was situated in the front of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 19]: By leaning out he could survey the carriage stand at the foot of the long flight of steps .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 24]: A pair-horse vehicle was drawn up there , and men were fastening portly dress baskets in the baggage carrier over the hind wheels .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 3]: He smiled .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 11]: `` The pretty dancer travels luxuriously , '' he thought .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 18]: `` I wonder whether she will be honest enough to pay her debts with my money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 13]: He still hated her for having dragged him into a public squabble .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 9]: He looked to the future to requite him .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 10]: A year , two years , would soon pass .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 23]: Then , when funds were low and engagements scarce , she would appeal to him again , and his solicitors would reply .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 24]: He caught himself framing curt , stinging sentences to be embodied in the letter ; but he drew himself up with a start .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 21]: Surely there was something very wrong with Mark Bower , the millionaire , when he gloated over such paltry details .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 16]: Why , his reflections were worthy of that old spitfire , Mrs. de Courcy Vavasour .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 6]: His cigar had gone out .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 5]: He threw it away .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 10]: It had the taste of Millicent 's cheap passion .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 26]: A decanter of brandy stood on the table , and he drank a small quantity , though he had imbibed freely of champagne at luncheon .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 6]: He glanced at a mirror .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 16]: His face was flushed and care lined , and he scowled at his own apparition .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 11]: `` I must go and see the last of Millicent .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 12]: It will cheer me up , '' he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 21]: When he entered the foyer , Millicent was already in the veranda , a dainty picture in furs and feathers .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 10]: Somewhat to his surprise , Helen was with her .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 21]: A good many people were watching them covertly , a quite natural proceeding in view of their strained relations overnight .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 17]: -LSB- Illustration : `` It will paralyze the dowager brigade if we hug each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 50]: _ Page 309 _ -RSB- Millicent 's first action after quitting the _ salle à manger _ had been to worm out of Léontine the full , true , and particular history of Etta Stampa , or so much of the story as was known to the hotel servants .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 31]: The recital was cut short by Helen 's visit , but resumed during packing operations , as Millicent had enlarged her store of knowledge considerably during the process of reconciliation .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 29]: So , alive to possibilities going far beyond a single check , even for five thousand pounds , at the last moment she sent a message to Helen .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 11]: `` Come and see me off , '' she wrote .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 18]: `` It will simply paralyze the dowager brigade if we hug each other on the mat . ''
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 3]: Helen agreed .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 25]: She was not sorry that her critics should be paralyzed , or stupefied , or rendered incapable in some way of inflicting further annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 32]: In her present radiant mood , nearly all her troubles having taken unto themselves wings , she looked on yesterday 's episode in the light of a rather far fetched joke .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 28]: Bower stood so high in her esteem that she was sure the outspoken announcement of his intentions was dictated chiefly by anger at Millicent 's unfair utterances .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 20]: Perhaps he had some thought of marriage ; but he must seek a wife in a more exalted sphere .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 38]: She felt in her heart that Spencer was only awaiting a favorable opportunity to declare his love , and she did not strive to repress the wave of divine happiness that flooded her heart at the thought .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 54]: After much secret pondering and some shy confidences intrusted to Mrs. de la Vere , she had resolved to tell him that if he left the Maloja at once -- an elastic phrase in lovers ' language -- and came to her in London next month , she would have an answer ready .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 16]: She persuaded herself that there was no other honorable way out of an embarrassing position .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 13]: She had come to Switzerland for work , not for love making .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 29]: Spencer would probably wish to marry her forthwith , and that was not to be thought of while `` The Firefly 's '' commission was only half completed .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 34]: All of which modest and maidenly reasoning left wholly out of account Spencer 's strenuous wooing ; it is chronicled here merely to show her state of mind when she kissed Millicent farewell .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 32]: It is worthy of note also that two young people who might be expected to take the liveliest interest in each other 's company were steadfast in their determination to separate .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 30]: Each meant to send the other back to England with the least possible delay , and both were eager to fly into each other 's arms -- in London !
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 35]: Whereat the gods may have laughed , or frowned , as the case may be , if they glanced at the horoscopes of certain mortals pent within the mountain walls of the Upper Engadine .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 22]: While Helen was still gazing after Millicent 's retreating carriage , Bower came from the darksome foyer to the sunlit veranda .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 10]: `` So you parted the best of friends ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 4]: he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 10]: She turned and looked at him with shining eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 20]: `` I can not tell you how pleased I am that a stupid misunderstanding should be cleared away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 25]: `` Then I share your pleasure , though , to be candid , I was thinking that a woman 's kiss has infinite gradations .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 11]: It may savor of Paradise or the Dead Sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 35]: `` But she told me how grieved she was that she had behaved so foolishly , and appealed to me not to let the folly of a day break the friendship of years . ''
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 11]: Millicent picks up some well turned sentiments on the stage .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 15]: Come out for a little stroll , and tell me all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 3]: Helen hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 18]: `` It will soon be tea time , '' she said , with a self conscious blush .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 31]: She had promised Spencer to walk with him to the château ; but her visit to Millicent had intervened , and he was not on the veranda at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 7]: `` We need not go far .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 9]: The sun has garnished the roads for us .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 22]: What do you say if we make for the village , and interview Johann Klucker 's cat on the weather ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 6]: His tone was quite reassuring .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 28]: To her transparent honesty of purpose it seemed better that they should discuss Millicent 's motive in coming to the hotel and then dismiss it for ever .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 11]: `` A most excellent idea , '' she cried lightly .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 20]: `` I have been writing all the morning , so a breath of fresh air will be grateful . ''
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 6]: They passed down the steps .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 26]: They had not gone more than a few paces when the driver of an empty carriage pulled up his vehicle and handed Bower a telegram .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 17]: `` They gave it to me at St. Moritz , Herr Bower , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 36]: `` I took a message there for Herr Spencer , and they asked me to bring this to you , as it would reach you more quickly than if it came by the post . ''
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 10]: Bower thanked the man , and opened the envelop .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 25]: It was a very long telegram ; but he only glanced at it in the most cursory manner before putting it in a pocket .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 30]: At a distant corner of the road by the side of the lake , Millicent turned for a last look at the hotel and waved a hand at them .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 3]: Helen replied .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 18]: `` I almost wish now she was staying here a few days , '' she said wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 14]: `` She ought to have seen our valley in its summer greenery . ''
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 16]: `` I fear she brought winter in her train , '' was Bower 's comment .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 8]: `` But the famous cat must decide .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 23]: Here , boy , '' he went on , hailing a village urchin , `` where is Johann Klucker 's house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 18]: The boy pointed to a track that ran close to the right bank of the tiny Inn .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 11]: He explained volubly , and was rewarded with a franc .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 8]: `` Do you know this path ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 3]: asked Bower .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 22]: `` Klucker 's chalet is near the waterfall , which should be a fine sight owing to the melting snow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 7]: It was Helen 's favorite walk .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 35]: She would have preferred a more frequented route ; but the group of houses described by the boy was quite near , and she could devise no excuse for keeping to the busy highway .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 10]: As the path was narrow she walked in front .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 26]: The grass and flowers seemed to have drawn fresh tints from the snow , which had cleared away with magical rapidity from this sheltered spot .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 17]: But the little rivulet , usually diamond bright , was now a turbulent and foaming stream .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 7]: Care was needed not to slip .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 20]: If anyone fell into that miniature torrent , it would be no easy matter to escape without broken bones .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 33]: `` Would you ever believe that a few hours ' snow , followed by a hot sun , would make such a difference to a mere ribbon of water like this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 27]: she asked , when they were passing through a narrow cleft in a wall of rock through which the Inn roared with a quite respectable fury .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 14]: `` I am in a mood to believe anything , '' said Bower .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 12]: `` Do you remember our first meeting at the Embankment Hotel ?
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 32]: Who would have imagined then that Millicent Jaques , a few weeks later , would rush a thousand miles to the Maloja and scream her woes to Heaven and the multitude .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 15]: Neither you nor I , I fancy , had seen her during the interval .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 12]: Did she tell you the cause of her extraordinary behavior ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 6]: I did not ask her .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 9]: But it scarce needed explanation , Mr. Bower .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 10]: I -- I fear she suspected me of flirting .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 35]: It was unjust ; but I can well conceive that a woman who thinks her friend is robbing her of a man 's affections does not wait to consider nice points of procedure . ''
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 15]: `` Surely Millicent did not say that I had promised to marry her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 22]: Though Helen was not prepared for this downright plunge into an embarrassing discussion , she managed to evade a direct answer .
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 19]: `` There was more than a suggestion of that in her words last night , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 9]: `` Perhaps she thought so in all seriousness .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 35]: You seem to have undeceived her to-day , and I am sure you must have dealt with her kindly , or she would not have acknowledged her mistake in such frank terms to me .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 4]: There , now !
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 10]: That is the end of a very disagreeable episode .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 9]: Shall we say no more about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 26]: Helen was flushed and hurried of speech : but she persevered bravely , hoping that Bower 's tact would not desert him at this crisis .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 29]: She quickened her pace a little , with the air of one who has said the last word on a difficult topic and is anxious to forget it .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 4]: Bower overtook her .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 16]: He grasped her shoulder almost roughly , and drew her round till she faced him .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 11]: `` You are trying to escape me , Helen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 4]: he said hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 5]: `` That is impossible .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 20]: Someone must have told you what I said to Millicent in the hearing of all who chose to listen .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 17]: Her amazing outburst forced from me an avowal that should have been made to you alone .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 10]: Helen , I want you to be my wife .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 9]: I love you better than all the world .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 11]: I have my faults , -- what man is flawless ?
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 11]: -- but I have the abiding virtue of loving you .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 9]: I shall make your life happy , Helen .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 17]: For God 's sake do not tell me that you are already promised to another ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 15]: His eyes blazed into hers with a passion that was appalling in its intensity .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 11]: She seemed to lose the power to speak or move .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 20]: She looked up at him like a frightened child , who hears strange words that she does not comprehend .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 20]: Thinking he had won her , he threw his arms about her and strained her fiercely to his breast .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 25]: He strove to kiss away the tears that began to fall in piteous protest ; but she bent her head as if in shame .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 9]: `` Oh , please let me go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 3]: she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 6]: `` Please let me go !
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 13]: What have I done that you should treat me so cruelly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 5]: `` Cruelly , Helen ?
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 14]: How should I be cruel to you whom I hold so dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 24]: Still he clasped her tightly , hardly knowing what he did in his transport of joy at the belief that she was his .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 6]: She struggled to free herself .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 11]: She shrank from this physical contact with a strange repulsion .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 24]: She felt as a timid animal must feel when some lord of the jungle pulls it down and drags it to his lair .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 23]: Bower was kissing her cheeks , her forehead , her hair , finding a mad rapture in the fragrance of her skin .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 12]: He crushed her in a close embrace that was almost suffocating .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 9]: `` Oh , please let me go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 3]: she wailed .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 5]: `` You frighten me .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 4]: Let me go !
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 5]: How dare you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 17]: She fought so wildly that he yielded to a dim sense that she was in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 5]: He relaxed his grip .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 21]: With the instinct of a hunted thing , she took a dangerous leap for safety clean across the swollen Inn .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 25]: Luckily she alighted on a broad boulder , or a sprained ankle would have been the least penalty for that desperate means of escape .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 44]: As she stood there , with tears streaming down her face and the crimson brand of angry terror on her brow , the dreadful knowledge that he had lost her smote Bower like a rush of cold air from a newly opened tomb .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 7]: Between them brawled the tiny torrent .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 26]: It offered no bar to an active man ; but even in his panic of sudden perception he resisted the impulse that bade him follow .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 23]: `` Helen , '' he pleaded , stretching forth his hands in frenzied gesture , `` why do you cast me off ?
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 14]: I swear by all a man holds sacred that I mean no wrong .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 9]: You are dear to me as life itself .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 10]: Ah , Helen , say that I may hope !
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 9]: I do not even ask for your love .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 11]: I shall win that by a lifetime of devotion . ''
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 6]: At last she found utterance .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 22]: He had alarmed her greatly ; but no woman can feel it an outrage that a man should avow his longing .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 9]: And she pitied Bower with a great pity .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 20]: Deep down in her heart was a suspicion that they might have been happy together had they met sooner .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 50]: She would never have loved him , -- she knew that now beyond cavil , -- but if they were married she must have striven to make life pleasant for him , while she drifted down the smooth stream of existence free from either abiding joys or carking sorrows .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 40]: `` I am more grieved than I can tell that this should have happened , '' she said , striving hard to restrain the sob in her voice , though it gave her words the ring of genuine regret .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 16]: `` I little dreamed that you thought of me in that way , Mr. Bower .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 15]: But I can never marry you -- never , no matter what the circumstances !
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 14]: Surely you will help me to dispel the memory of a foolish moment .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 9]: It has been trying to both of us .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 9]: Let us pretend that it never was . ''
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 26]: Had she struck him with a whip he could not have flinched so visibly beneath the lash as from the patent honesty of her words .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 27]: For a time he did not answer , and the sudden calm that came quick on the heels of frenzy had in it a weird peacefulness .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 46]: Neither could ever again forget the noisy rush of the stream , the glad singing of birds in a thicket overhanging the bank , the tinkle of the cow bells as the cattle began to climb to the pastures for a luxurious hour ere sundown .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 39]: It was typical of their lives that they should be divided by the infant Inn , almost at its source , and that thenceforth the barrier should become ever wider and deeper till it reached the infinite sea .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 8]: He seemed to take his defeat well .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 15]: He was pale , and his lips twitched with the effort to attain composure .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 14]: He looked at Helen with a hungry longing that was slowly acknowledging restraint .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 19]: `` I must have frightened you , '' he said , breaking a silence that was growing irksome .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 8]: `` Of course I apologize for that .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 10]: But we can not leave things where they are .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 18]: If you must send me away from you , I may at least demand a clear understanding .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 10]: Have no fear that I shall distress you further .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 18]: May I join you , or will you walk to the bridge a little higher up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 12]: `` Let us return to the hotel , '' she protested .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 5]: We are not children .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 10]: We have broken no law of God or man .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 31]: Why should I be ashamed of having asked you to marry me , or you to listen , even though it be such a hopeless fantasy as you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 20]: Helen , deeply moved in his behalf , walked to a bridge of planks a little distance up stream .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 5]: Bower joined her there .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 10]: He had deliberately resolved to do a dastardly thing .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 24]: If Spencer was the cause of Helen 's refusal , that obstacle , at any rate , could be smashed to a pulp .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 23]: `` Now , Helen , '' he said , `` I want you to believe that your happiness is my only concern .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 24]: Perhaps , at some other time , you may allow me to renew in less abrupt manner the proposal I have made to-day .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 48]: But when you hear all that I have to tell , you will be forced to admit that I placed your high repute above every other consideration in declaring my love before , rather than after , you learned how and why you came to Switzerland . ''
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 11]: His manner was becoming more calm and judicial each moment .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 20]: It reacted on Helen , who gazed at him with a very natural surprise in her still tear-laden eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 14]: `` That , at least , is simple enough , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 14]: It is menacing , ugly , a trick calculated to wound you sorely .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 17]: When first it came to my ears I refused to credit the vile meanness of it .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 14]: You saw that telegram which reached my hands as we quitted the hotel ?
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 15]: It is a reply to certain inquiries I caused to be made in London .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 4]: Read it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 13]: Helen took the crumpled sheets of thin paper and began to read .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 18]: Bower watched her face with a maleficent confidence that might have warned her had she seen it .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 29]: But she paid heed to nothing else at that moment save the mysterious words scrawled in a foreign handwriting : `` Have investigated ` Firefly ' incident fully .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 6]: Pargrave compelled Mackenzie to explain .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 28]: The American , Charles K. Spencer , recently residing at Embankment Hotel , is paying Miss Helen Wynton 's expenses , including cost of publishing her articles .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 18]: He followed her on the day of her departure , and has since asked Mackenzie for introduction .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 11]: Pargrave greatly annoyed , and holds Mackenzie at your disposal .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 4]: `` KENNETT . ''
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 19]: Helen went very white ; but she spoke with a firmness that was amazing , even to Bower .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 6]: `` Who is Kennett ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 8]: `` One of my confidential clerks . ''
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 5]: `` And Pargrave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 10]: `` The proprietor of ` The Firefly . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 10]: `` Did Millicent know of this -- plot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 7]: Then she murmured a broken prayer .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 7]: `` Ah , dear Heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 13]: she complained , `` for what am I punished so bitterly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 25]: Karl , the voluble and sharp-eyed , retailed a bit of gossip to Stampa that evening as they smoked in Johann Klucker 's chalet .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 33]: `` As I was driving the cattle to the middle alp to-day , I saw our _ fräulein _ in the arms of the big _ voyageur _ , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 9]: Stampa withdrew his pipe from between his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 16]: `` Say that again , '' he whispered , as though afraid of being overheard .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 8]: Karl did so , with fuller details .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 6]: `` Are you sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 3]: asked Stampa .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 5]: Karl sniffed scornfully . ''
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 5]: _ Ach , Gott !
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 7]: _ How could I err ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 21]: `` There are not so many pretty women in the hotel that I should not recognize our _ fräulein _ .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 7]: And who would forget Herr Bower ?
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 11]: He gave me two louis for a ten francs job .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 12]: We must get them together on the hills again , Christian .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 18]: He will be soft hearted now , and pay well for taking care of his lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 11]: `` Yes , '' said Stampa , resuming his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 7]: `` You are right , Karl .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 8]: There is no place like the hills .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 12]: And he will pay -- the highest price , look you !
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 3]: _ Saperlotte !
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 11]: _ I shall exact a heavy fee this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 20]: CHAPTER XVI SPENCER EXPLAINS A sustained rapping on the inner door of the hut roused Helen from dreamless sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 26]: In the twilight of the mind that exists between sleeping and waking she was bewildered by the darkness , perhaps baffled by her novel surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 22]: She strove to pierce the gloom with wide-open , unseeing eyes , but the voice of her guide broke the spell .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 10]: `` Time to get up , _ sigñora _ .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 19]: The sun is on the rock , and we have a piece of bad snow to cross . ''
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 7]: Then she remembered , and sighed .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 14]: The sigh was involuntary , the half conscious tribute of a wearied heart .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 41]: It needed an effort to brace herself against the long hours of a new day , the hours when thoughts would come unbidden , when regrets that she was fighting almost fiercely would rush in and threaten to overwhelm her .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 5]: But Helen was brave .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 17]: She had the courage that springs from the conviction of having done that which is right .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 58]: If she was a woman too , with a woman 's infinite capacity for suffering -- well , that demanded another sort of bravery , a resolve to subdue the soul 's murmurings , a spiritual teeth-clenching in the determination to prevail , a complete acceptance of unmerited wrongs in obedience to some inexplicable decree of Providence .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 46]: So she rose from a couch which at least demanded perfect physical health ere one could find rest on it , and , being fully dressed , went forth at once to drink the steaming hot coffee that filled the tiny hut with its fragrance .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 8]: `` A fine morning , Pietro ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 12]: she asked , addressing the man who had summoned her . ''
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 5]: _ Si , sigñora .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 8]: _ Dawn is breaking with good promise .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 19]: There is a slight mist on the glacier ; but the rock shows clear in the sun . ''
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 38]: She knew that an amiable grin was on the man 's face ; but it was so dark in the _ cabane _ that she could see little beyond the figures of the guide and his companion .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 37]: She went to the door , and stood for a minute on the narrow platform of rough stones that provided the only level space in a witches ' cauldron of moss covered boulders and rough ice .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 36]: Beneath her feet was an ultramarine mist , around her were masses of black rock ; but overhead was a glorious pink canopy , fringed by far flung circles of translucent blue and tenderest green .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 10]: And this heaven 's own shield was ever widening .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 18]: Eastward its arc was broken by an irregular dark mass , whose pinnacles glittered like burnished gold .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 30]: That was the Aguagliouls Rock , which rises so magnificently in the midst of a vast ice field , like some great portal to the wonderland of the Bernina .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 23]: She had seen it the night before , after leaving the small restaurant that nestles at the foot of the Roseg Glacier .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 22]: Then its scarred sides , brightened by the crimson and violet rays of the setting sun , looked friendly and inviting .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 27]: Though its base was a good mile distant across the snow-smoothed surface of the ice , she could discern every crevice and ledge and steep couloir .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 13]: Now , all these distinguishing features were merged in the sea-blue mist .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 21]: The great wall itself seemed to be one vast , unscalable precipice , capped by a series of shining spires .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 42]: And for the first time in three sorrowful days , while her eyes dwelt on that castle above the clouds , the mysterious grandeur of nature healed her vexed spirit , and the peace that passeth all understanding fell upon her .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 23]: The miserable intrigues and jealousies of the past weeks were so insignificant , so far away , up here among the mountains .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 19]: Had she only consulted her own happiness , she mused , she would not have ordered events differently .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 24]: There was no real reason why she should have flown from the hotel like a timid deer roused by hounds from a thicket .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 33]: Instead of doubling and twisting from St. Moritz to Samaden , and back by carriage to a remote hotel in the Roseg Valley , she might have remained and defied her persecutors .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 19]: But now the fume and fret were ended , and she tried to persuade herself she was glad .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 15]: She felt that she could never again endure the sight of Bower 's face .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 39]: The memory of his passionate embrace , of his blazing eyes , of the thick sensual lips that forced their loathsome kisses upon her , was bitter enough without the need of reviving it each time they met .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 15]: She was sorry it was impossible to bid farewell to Mrs. de la Vere .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 41]: Any hint of her intent would have drawn from that well-disposed cynic a flood of remonstrance hard to stem ; though nothing short of force would have kept Helen at Maloja once she was sure of Spencer 's double dealing .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 18]: Of course , she might write to Mrs. de la Vere when she was in calmer mood .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 23]: It would be easier then to pick and choose the words that would convey in full measure her detestation of the American .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 12]: For she hated him -- yes , hatred alone was satisfying .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 11]: She despised her own heart because it whispered a protest .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 6]: Yet she feared him too .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 8]: It was from him that she fled .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 18]: She admitted this to her honest mind while she watched the spreading radiance of the new day .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 23]: She feared the candor of his steady eyes more than the wiles and hypocrisies of Bower and her false friend , Millicent .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 25]: By a half miraculous insight into the history of recent events , she saw that Bower had followed her to Switzerland with evil intent .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 39]: But the discovery embittered her the more against Spencer , who had lured her there deliberately , than against Bower who knew of it , nor scrupled to use the knowledge as best it marched with his designs .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 29]: It was nothing to her , she told herself , that Spencer no less than Bower had renounced his earlier purpose , and was ready to marry her .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 18]: She still quivered with anger at the thought that she had fallen so blindly into the toils .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 22]: Even though she accepted Mackenzie 's astounding commission , she might have guessed that there was some ignoble element underlying it .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 26]: She felt now that it was possible to be prepared , -- to scrutinize occurrences more closely , to hold herself aloof from compromising incidents .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 53]: The excursion to the Forno , the manifest interest she displayed in both men , the concealment of her whereabouts from friends in London , her stiff lipped indifference to the opinion of other residents in the hotel , -- these things , trivial individually , united into a strong self indictment .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 44]: As for Spencer , though she meant , above all things , to avoid meeting him , and hoped that he was now well on his way to the wide world beyond Maloja , she would never forgive him -- no , never !
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 63]: `` I am sorry to hurry you , _ sigñora _ , but there is a bit of really bad snow on the Sella Pass , '' urged Pietro apologetically at her shoulder , and she reëntered the hut at once , sitting down to that which she deemed to be her last meal on the Swiss side of the Upper Engadine .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 24]: It was in a hotel at St. Moritz that she had settled her route with the aid of a map and a guidebook .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 28]: When , on that day of great happenings , she quitted the Kursaal-Maloja , she stipulated that the utmost secrecy should be observed as to her departure .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 22]: Her boxes and portmanteau were brought from her room by the little used exit she had discovered soon after her arrival .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 19]: A closed carriage met her there in the dusk , and she drove straight to St. Moritz station .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 29]: Leaving her baggage in the parcels office , she sought a quiet hotel for the night , registering her room under her mother 's maiden name of Trenholme .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 35]: She meant to return to England by the earliest train in the morning ; but her new-born terror of encountering Spencer set in motion a scheme for evading pursuit either by him or Bower .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 70]: By going up the Roseg Valley , and carrying the barest necessaries for a few days ' travel , she could cross the Bernina range into Italy , reach the rail at Sondrio , and go round by Como to Lucerne and thence to Basle , whither the excellent Swiss system of delivering passengers ' luggage would convey her bulky packages long before she was ready to claim them .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 28]: With a sense of equity that was creditable , she made up her mind to expend every farthing of the money received from `` The Firefly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 23]: She had kept her contract faithfully : Mackenzie , therefore , or Spencer , must abide by it to the last letter .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 14]: The third article of the series was already written and in the post .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 46]: The fourth she wrote quietly in her room at the St. Moritz hotel , nor did she stir out during the next day until it was dark , when she walked a few yards up the main street to buy a rucksack and an alpenstock .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 19]: Early next morning , close wrapped and veiled , she took a carriage to the Restaurant du Glacier .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 7]: Here she met an unforeseen check .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 19]: The local guides were absent in the Bernina , and the hotel proprietor -- good , careful man !
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 32]: -- would not hear of intrusting the pretty English girl to inexperienced villagers , but persuaded her to await the coming of a party from Italy , whose rooms were bespoke .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 24]: Their guides , in all probability , would be returning over the Sella Pass , and would charge far less for the journey .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 4]: He was right .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 73]: On the afternoon of the following day , three tired Englishmen arrived at the restaurant , and their hardy Italian pilots were only too glad to find a _ voyageur _ ready to start at once for the Mortel hut , whence a nine hours ' climb would take them back to the Val Malenco , provided they crossed the dangerous névé on the upper part of the glacier soon after daybreak .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 10]: Pietro , the leader , was a cheery soul .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 42]: Like others of his type in the Bernina region , he spoke a good deal of German , and his fund of pleasant anecdote and reminiscence kept Helen from brooding on her own troubles during the long evening in the hut .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 49]: And now , while she was finishing her meal in the dim light of dawn , and the second guide was packing their few belongings , Pietro regaled her with a legend of the Monte del Diavolo , which overlooks Sondrio and the lovely valley of the Adda .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 42]: `` Once upon a time , _ sigñora _ , they used to grow fine grapes there , '' he said , `` and the wine was always sent to Rome for the special use of the Pope and his cardinals .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 43]: That made the people proud , and the devil took possession of them , which greatly grieved a pious hermit who dwelt in a cell in the little Val Malgina , by the side of a torrent that flows into the Adda .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 26]: So one day he asked the good Lord to permit the devil to visit him ; but when Satan appeared the saint laughed at him .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 4]: ` You ! '
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 6]: ` Who sent for you ?
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 11]: You are not the Prince of the Infernal Regions ? '
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 7]: -- ` Am I not ? '
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 10]: said the stranger , with a truly fiendish grin .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 13]: ` Just try my powers , and see what will happen ! '
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 26]: -- ` Very well , ' said the saint , ` produce me twenty barrels of better wine than can be grown in Sondrio . '
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 10]: So old Barbariccia stamped his hoof , and lo !
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 28]: there were the twenty barrels , while the mere scent of them nearly made the saint break a vow that he would never again taste fermented wine .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 16]: But he held fast , and said , ` Now , drink the lot . '
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 7]: -- ` Oh , nonsense ! '
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 4]: roared the devil .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 4]: ` Pooh ! '
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 32]: said the hermit , ` you 're not much of a devil if you ca n't do in a moment what the College of Cardinals can do in a week . '
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 21]: That annoyed Satan , and he put away barrel after barrel , until the saint began to feel very uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 38]: But the last barrel finished him , and down he went like a log , whereupon the holy man put him into one of his own tubs and sent him to Rome to be dealt with properly .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 16]: There was a tremendous row , it is said , when the cask was opened .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 49]: In the confusion , Satan escaped ; but in revenge for the trick that had been played on him , he put a blight on the vines of the Adda , and from that day to this never a liter of decent wine came out of Sondrio . ''
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 25]: `` I guess if that occurred anywhere in Italy nowadays , they 'd lynch the hermit , '' said a voice in English outside .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 10]: Helen screamed , and the two Italians were startled .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 11]: No one was expected at the hut at that hour .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 19]: Its earliest visitors should come from the inner range , after a long tramp from Italy or Pontresina .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 31]: `` Sorry if I scared you , '' said Spencer , his tall figure suddenly darkening the doorway ; `` but I did n't like to interrupt the story . ''
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 6]: Helen sprang to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 13]: Her cheeks , blanched for a few seconds , became rosy red .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 4]: `` You ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 9]: `` How dare you follow me here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 25]: In the rapidly growing light she caught a transitory gleam in the American 's eyes , though his face was as impassive as usual .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 14]: And the worst of it was that it suggested humor , not resentment .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 36]: Even in the tumult of wounded pride that took her heart by storm , she realized that her fiery vehemence had gone perilously near to a literal translation of the saintly scoff at old Barbariccia .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 11]: And , now if ever , she must be dignified .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 5]: Anger yielded to disdain .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 10]: In an instant she grew cold and self collected .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 15]: `` I regret that in my surprise I spoke unguardedly , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 39]: `` Of course , this hut is open to everyone -- '' `` Judging by the look of things between here and the hotel , we shall not be worried by a crowd , '' broke in Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 25]: `` I meant to arrive half an hour earlier ; but that slope on the Alp Ota offers surprising difficulties in the dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 33]: `` I wished to say , when you interrupted me , that I am leaving at once , so my presence can make little difference to you , '' said Helen grandly .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 17]: `` That sounds more reasonable than it really is , '' was the quietly flippant reply .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 6]: `` It conveys my intent .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 16]: I have no desire to prolong this conversation , '' she cried rather more flurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 9]: `` Now , there I agree with you .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 10]: We have started on the wrong set of rails .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 5]: It is my fault .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 26]: I ought to have coughed , or fallen down the moraine , or done any old thing sooner than butt into the talk so unexpectedly .
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 14]: If you will allow me , I 'll begin again right now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 33]: He turned to the Italians , who were watching and listening in curious silence , trying to pick up an odd word that would help to explain the relations between the two .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 15]: `` Will you gentlemen take an interest in the scenery for five minutes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 7]: he asked , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 21]: Though the valley of the Adda may have lost its wine , it will never lose its love of romance .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 10]: The polite Italians raised their hats and went out .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 13]: Helen , drawing a long breath , withdrew somewhat into the shadow .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 19]: She felt that she would have more command over herself if the American could not see her face .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 9]: The ruse did not avail her at all .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 14]: Spencer crossed the floor of the hut until he looked into her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 17]: `` Helen , '' he said , `` why did you run away from me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 38]: The tender reproach in his voice almost unnerved her ; but she answered simply , `` What else would you have me do , once I found out the circumstances under which I came to Switzerland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 12]: `` It may be that you were not told the truth .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 6]: Who was your informant ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 5]: `` Mr. Bower . ''
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 5]: `` None other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 5]: `` What , then ?
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 11]: Is my pitiful story the property of the hotel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 5]: `` It is now .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 6]: I took care of that .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 20]: Some of the people there had been spreading a misleading version , and it was necessary to correct it .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 12]: The women , of course , I could not deal with .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 24]: As the General was an old man , I picked out George de Courcy Vavasour as best fitted to digest the wrong edition .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 6]: I made him eat it .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 16]: It seemed to disagree with him ; but he got through with an effort . ''
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 10]: Helen felt that she ought to decline further discussion .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 6]: But she was tongue tied .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 26]: Spencer was regarding her so fixedly that she began to fear lest he might notice the embarrassed perplexity that she herself was quite conscious of .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 14]: `` Will you be good enough to explain exactly what you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 11]: she said , forcing the question mechanically from her lips .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 8]: `` That is why I am here .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 19]: I assure you that subterfuge can never again exist between you and me , '' said he earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 8]: `` You can accept my words literally .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 27]: Acting for himself and others , Vavasour wrote on paper the lying insinuations made by Miss Jaques , and ate them -- both words and paper .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 23]: He happened to use the thin , glazed , Continental variety , so what it lost in bulk it gained in toughness .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 18]: He did n't like it , and said so ; but he had to do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 25]: She was nervously aware of a wish to laugh ; but unless she gave way to hysteria that was not to be thought of .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 30]: Trying to retreat still farther into the friendly shade , she backed round the inner end of the table , but found the way blocked by a rough bench .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 10]: Something must be said or done to extricate herself .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 12]: The dread that her voice might break was becoming an obsession .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 22]: `` You speak of a false version , and that implies a true one , '' she managed to say constrainedly .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 13]: `` How far was Mr. Bower 's statement false or true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 7]: `` I settled that point too .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 7]: Mr. Bower told you the facts .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 10]: The deduction he forced on you was a lie .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 24]: To my harmless notion of gratifying a girl 's longing for a holiday abroad he added the motive that inspired his own journey .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 39]: I overheard your conversation with Miss Jaques in the Embankment Hotel ; I saw Bower introduced to you ; I saw him looking for you in Victoria Station , and knew that he represented the meeting as accidental .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 17]: I felt a certain responsibility on your account ; so I followed by the next train .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 15]: Bower played his cards so well that I found myself in a difficult position .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 26]: I was busy guessing ; but was unable to prove anything , while the one story I was sure of was not in the game .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 21]: And then , you see , he wanted to make you his wife , which brought about the real complication .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 32]: I have n't much use for him ; but I must be fair , and Bower 's only break was when he misrepresented my action in subsidizing ` The Firefly . '
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 42]: I do n't deny he was pretty mad at the idea of losing you , and jealousy will often drive a man to do a mean thing which might otherwise be repugnant to his better nature -- '' `` Jealousy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 16]: shrilled Helen , her woman 's wit at last finding a joint in his armor .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 20]: Yet never did woman err more than she in thinking that her American suitor would flinch beneath the shaft .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 12]: `` That is the word , '' was the quiet reply .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 6]: She flared into indignant scorn .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 24]: `` Pray tell me why he or any other man should feel jealous of you where I am concerned , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 12]: `` I am going to tell you right away -- Helen .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 7]: But that is the last chapter .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 28]: There is quite a long record as to the way I hit on your track in St. Moritz , and heard of you by telephone last night .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 26]: Of course , that part of the story will keep -- '' `` Is it necessary that I should hear any portion of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 20]: she interrupted , hoping to irritate him , and thus lessen the strain imposed by his studiously tranquil manner .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 9]: `` Well , it ought to interest you .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 16]: But it has humorous points to which I ca n't do justice under present conditions .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 11]: You are right , Helen -- you most always are .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 34]: The real question at issue is my position in the deal , which becomes quite clear when I say that you are the only woman I have ever loved or ever shall love .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 71]: More than that , you are the only woman to whom I have ever spoken a word of love , and as I have set about loving the dearest and prettiest and healthiest girl I have ever seen , it is safe to figure that you will have sole claim on all the nice things I can try to say to any woman during the remainder of my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 5]: He hesitated a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 22]: He did not appear to notice that Helen , after a rebellious gasp or two , had suddenly become very still .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 23]: `` I suppose I ought to have fixed up a finer bit of word painting than that , '' he continued slowly .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 66]: `` As a matter of fact , I do n't mind admitting that ever since eleven o'clock last night , when the proprietor of the hotel below there telephoned to me that Miss Trenholme had gone to the Mortel hut with two guides , I have been rehearsing X plus Y multiplied by Z ways of telling you just how dear you are to me .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 13]: But they all vanished like smoke when I saw your sweet face .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 29]: You tried to be severe with me , Helen ; but your voice did n't ring true , and you are the poorest sort of prevaricator I know .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 23]: And the reason those set forms would n't work at the right moment is that they were addressed to the silent air .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 9]: You are near me now , my sweet .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 7]: You are almost in my arms .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 30]: You are in my arms , Helen , and it sounds just right to keep on telling you that I love you now and shall love you for ever .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 18]: Oh , my dear , my dear , you must never , never , run away again !
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 42]: Search the dictionary for all the unkindest things you can say about me ; but do n't run away ... for I know now that when you are absent the day is night and the night is akin to death . ''
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 12]: * * * * * Guide Pietro was somewhat a philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 30]: Stamping about on the tiny stone plateau of the hut to keep at bay the cold mists from the glacier , he happened to glance through the open door .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 5]: He drew away instantly .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 26]: `` Bartelommeo , '' he said to his companion , `` we shall not cross the Sella to-day with our charming _ voyageur _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 4]: Bartelommeo was surprised .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 17]: He looked at the clean cut crest of the rock , glowing now in vivid sunlight .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 15]: Argument was not required ; he pointed silently with the stem of his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' murmured Pietro .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 12]: `` We could n't have a better day for the pass .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 7]: It is not the weather . ''
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 7]: `` Then what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 7]: asked Bartelommeo , moved to speech .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 8]: `` She is going the other way .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 11]: Did n't you catch the tears in her voice yesterday ?
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 32]: She smiled at my stories , and carried herself bravely ; but her eyes were heavy , and the corners of her mouth drooped when she was left to her thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 21]: And again , my friend , did you not see her face when the young _ sigñor _ arrived ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 6]: `` She was frightened . ''
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 4]: Pietro laughed softly .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 12]: `` A woman always fears her lover , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 11]: `` That is just the reason why you married Caterina .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 7]: You liked her for her shyness .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 14]: It made you feel yourself a man -- a devil of a fellow .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 30]: Do n't you remember how timid she was , how she tried to avoid you , how she would dodge into anybody 's chalet rather than meet you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 8]: `` But how do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 16]: demanded Bartelommeo , waking into resentful appreciation of Pietro 's close acquaintance with his wooing .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 9]: `` Because I married Lola two years earlier .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 24]: Women are all the same , no matter what country they hail from -- nervous as young chamois before marriage -- but after !
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 4]: Body of Bacchus !
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 17]: Was it on Wednesday that Caterina hauled you out of the albergo to chop firewood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 12]: Bartelommeo grunted , and put his pipe in his mouth again .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 31]: CHAPTER XVII THE SETTLEMENT Though Helen was the better linguist , it was left to Spencer to explain that circumstances would prevent the lady from going to Malenco that day .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 20]: He did not fully understand why the men should exchange glances of darksome intelligence when he made this statement .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 26]: He fancied they were disappointed at losing a good customer ; so he went on brokenly : `` You are in no hurry , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 13]: Well , then , take us across the glacier to the Aguagliouls .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 19]: We should obtain a fine view from the summit , and get back to the hotel for luncheon .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 12]: I will pay the same rates as for the Sella . ''
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 6]: Both guides were manifestly pleased .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 22]: Pietro began a voluble recital of the glories that would meet their enraptured gaze from the top of the mighty rock .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 24]: `` You will see the Bernina splendidly , '' he cried , `` and Roseg too , and the Glüschaint and Il Chapütschin .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 18]: If the lady will trust to us , we can bring her down the Tschierva glacier safely .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 20]: You are a climber , _ sigñor _ , else you could never have crossed the Ota before dawn .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 9]: But let us make another cup of coffee .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 29]: The middle Roseg ice is safe at any hour , and if we are on the rock by nine o'clock that will be perfect for the sun . ''
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 12]: Already a grand panorama of glaciers and peaks was unfolding itself .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 23]: A cloudless sky promised a lovely August day , and what that means in the high Alps the mountaineer alone can tell .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 10]: But Spencer turned his back on the outer glory .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 45]: He had eyes only for Helen , while she , looking mistily at the giant rock across the valley , saw it not at all , for she was peering into her own soul , and found the prospect dazzling in its pure delight .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 28]: So they sat down to a fresh brew of coffee , and Spencer horrified Helen by a confession that he had eaten nothing since the previous evening .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 61]: Her tender solicitude for his needs , her hasty unpacking of rolls and sandwiches , her anxiety that he should endeavor to consume the whole of the provisions intended for the day 's march , were all sufficing guerdon for the sufferings of those miserable days since the hour when Mrs. de la Vere told him that Helen had gone .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 27]: It was a new experience for Spencer to have a gracious and smiling woman so greatly concerned for his welfare ; but it was decidedly agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 15]: These little attentions admitted so much that she dared not tell -- as yet .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 11]: And he had such a budget of news for her !
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 20]: Though he found it difficult to eat and talk at the same time , he boldly made the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 15]: `` Stampa was the genius who really unraveled the mystery , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 24]: `` Certainly , I managed to discover , in the first instance , that you had deposited your baggage in your own name .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 44]: Had all else failed , I should have converted myself into a label and stuck to your boxes till you claimed them at Basle ; but once we ascertained that you had not quitted St. Moritz by train , Stampa did the rest .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 28]: He knows St. Moritz like a book , and it occurred to him that you had changed your name -- '' `` Why , I wonder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 4]: she broke in .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 9]: `` That is rather hard to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 20]: He wrestled valiantly with the leg of a tough chicken , and thus was able to evade the question .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 3]: Poor Stampa !
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 41]: clinging tenaciously to the belief that Helen bore some resemblance to his lost daughter , remembered that when Etta made her sorrowful journey from Zermatt she gave another name at the little hostelry in Maloja where she ended her life .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 25]: `` Anyhow , '' went on Spencer , having dexterously severed the joint , `` he tracked you from St. Moritz to the Roseg .
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 15]: He even hit on the shop in which you bought your rucksack and alpenstock .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 21]: Then he put me on to the telephone , and the remainder of the chase was up to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 20]: `` I am sorry now that the dear old man did not come with you , '' cried Helen .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 26]: `` I look on him as the first of my friends in Switzerland , and shall be more than pleased to see him again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 12]: `` I pressed him to come along ; but he refused .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 22]: I do n't wish to pain you , dearest , but I guess he wants to keep track of Bower . ''
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 28]: Helen , who had no inkling of the tragedy that linked those two , blushed to her ears at the recollection of her parting from the millionaire .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 15]: `` Do you -- do you know that Mr. Bower proposed to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 3]: she stammered .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 12]: `` He told me that , and a lot more . ''
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 6]: `` Did you quarrel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 6]: `` We -- said things .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 11]: But I could n't treat Bower as I handled Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 13]: I was forced to admit his good taste , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 18]: `` Well , dear , promise me -- '' `` That I sha 'n' t slay him !
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 22]: Why , Helen , if he is half the man I take him for , he will come to our wedding .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 25]: I told Mrs. de la Vere I should bring you back , and she agreed that there was nothing else to be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 14]: The color ebbed and flowed on Helen 's face at an alarming rate .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 11]: `` What in the world are you talking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 13]: she asked , with a calm severity that her fluttering heart denied .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 24]: Spencer laughed so happily that Pietro , who understood no word of what his voyageurs were saying , gave Bartelommeo a sapient wink .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 55]: `` Well , now , '' he cried , `` would n't we be the queerest pair of zanies to go all that long way to London to get married when a parson , and a church , and all the needful consular offices are right here under our noses , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 13]: Why , we have a ready-made honeymoon staring us in the face .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 18]: We 'll just skate round Switzerland after your baggage and then drop down the map into Italy .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 19]: I figured it all out last night , together with ` steen methods of making the preliminary declaration .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 36]: I 'll tell you the whole scheme while we -- Oh , well , if you 're in a real hurry to cross the glacier , I must defer details and talk in headlines . ''
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 22]: For Helen , absolutely scarlet now , had risen with a tragic air and bade the guides prepare for instant departure .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 22]: The snow lay deep on the Roseg , and roping was essential , though Pietro undertook to avoid any difficult crevasses .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 14]: He led , Spencer followed , with Helen next , and Bartelommeo last .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 16]: They reached the opposite moraine in half an hour , and began to climb steadily .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 20]: The rock which looked so forbidding from the hut was by no means steep and not at all dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 30]: They had plenty of time , and often stopped to admire the magnificent vistas of the Val Roseg and the Bernina range that were gradually unfolding before their eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 20]: Soon they were on a level with the hut , the Alpine palace that had permitted their first embrace .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 34]: `` When we make our next trip to St. Moritz , Helen , we must seek out the finest and biggest photograph of the Mortel that money can buy , '' said Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 12]: Helen was standing a little above him on a broad ledge .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 8]: Her hand was resting on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 6]: `` Oh , look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 21]: she cried suddenly , pointing with her alpenstock to the massive mountain wall that rose above the _ cabane _ .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 11]: A few stones had fallen above a widespread snow slope .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 21]: The stones started an avalanche , and the roar of the tremendous cascade of snow and rock was distinctly audible .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 11]: Pietro uttered an exclamation , and hastily unslung a telescope .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 18]: He said something in a low tone to Bartelommeo ; but Spencer and Helen grasped its meaning .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 8]: The girl 's eyes dilated with terror .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 8]: `` There has been an accident ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 15]: Bartelommeo took the telescope in his turn and evidently agreed with the leading guide .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 13]: `` A party has fallen on Corvatsch , '' said Pietro gravely .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 9]: `` Two men are clinging to a ledge .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 13]: It is not a bad place ; but they can not move .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 14]: They must be injured , and there may be others -- below . ''
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 14]: `` Let us go to their assistance , '' said Spencer instantly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 6]: _ Per certo , sigñor .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 9]: _ That is the law of the hills .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 6]: But the _ sigñora _ ?
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 5]: What of her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 9]: `` She will remain at the hut . ''
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 54]: `` I will do anything you wish , '' said Helen sorrowfully , for her gladness had been changed to mourning by the fearsome tidings that two , if not more , human beings were in imminent danger on the slopes of the very hill that had witnessed the avowal of her love .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 22]: They raced back over the glacier , doubling on their own track , and were thus enabled to travel without precaution .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 16]: Leaving Helen at the hut , the men lost no time in beginning the ascent .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 40]: They were gone so long that she was almost frantic with dread in their behalf ; but at last they came , slowly , with the tread of care , for they were carrying the body of a man .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 22]: While they were yet a couple of hundred feet above the hut , Spencer intrusted the burden to the Italians alone .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 15]: He advanced with rapid strides , and Helen knew that he brought bad news .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 11]: `` Come , dear one , '' he said gently .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 11]: `` We must go to the inn and send help .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 24]: Our guides are bringing an injured man to the hut , and there is one other whom we left on the mountain . ''
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 4]: `` Dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 9]: `` Yes , killed instantly by a stone .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 4]: That was all .
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 16]: Just a mishap -- one of the things that can never be avoided in climbing .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 5]: But come , dear .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 9]: More men are needed , and a doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 8]: This poor fellow is badly hurt . ''
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 9]: `` Can I do nothing for him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 3]: she pleaded .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 12]: A species of fright twitched his grave face for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 17]: `` No , no , that is not to be thought of , '' he urged .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 12]: `` Pietro says he has some little skill in these matters .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 12]: He can do all that is needed until a doctor arrives .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 18]: Believe me , Helen , it is imperative that we should reach the hotel without delay . ''
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 7]: She went with him at once .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 6]: `` Who is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 10]: He steeled himself to answer according to his intent .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 57]: Though he had vowed that never again would he utter a syllable to his love that was not transparently true , how could he tell her then that Stampa was stretched lifeless on the broad bosom of Corvatsch , and that the Italians were carrying Bower , crushed and raving in delirium , to the hut .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 19]: `` An Englishman and his guide , I am sorry to say , '' was his prepared reply .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 25]: `` The guide is dead ; but his employer can be saved , I am sure , if only we rush things a bit .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 11]: Now , Helen , let us go at top speed .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 5]: No talking , dear .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 10]: We must make the hotel under the hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 10]: They did it , and help was soon forthcoming .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 16]: Then Spencer ordered a carriage , and insisted that Helen should drive to Maloja forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 22]: He would stay at Roseg , he said , to make certain that everything possible was done for the unfortunate climber .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 33]: Indeed , when his beloved was lost to sight down the winding road that leads to the main valley of the Engadine , he accompanied the men who went to the Mortel .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 19]: Halfway they met Pietro and Bartelommeo carrying Bower on an improvised stretcher , ice axes and a blanket .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 18]: By this time , under the stimulus of wine and warmth , Bower had regained his senses .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 23]: He recognized Spencer , and tried to speak ; but the American told him that even the least excitement must be avoided .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 20]: Once the hotel was reached , and they were waiting for the doctor , Bower could not be restrained .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 9]: `` It was you who rescued me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 4]: he said feebly .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 8]: `` I , and two Italian guides .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 14]: We saw the accident from the other side of the Roseg glacier . ''
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 7]: Stampa pointed you out to me .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 7]: I could not believe my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 13]: I watched you till the thought came that Stampa had befooled me .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 12]: Then he pushed me off the rock where we were standing .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 20]: I broke my leg in the fall ; but he held me there on the rope and taunted me .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 3]: Great God !
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 5]: how I suffered ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 15]: `` You really ought not to talk about it , '' said Spencer soothingly .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 4]: `` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 11]: He brought me there to kill me , he said .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 30]: The cunning old fox told me that I would find Helen in the Mortel hut , and offered to take me to her by a short cut over Corvatsch .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 5]: And I believed him !
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 7]: I was mad , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 12]: We did the Marmoré ascent by the light of the stars .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 7]: Do you realize what that means ?
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 11]: It is a hard climb for experts in broad daylight .
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 9]: But I meant to beat you , Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 8]: Stampa vowed you were in St. Moritz .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 6]: And again I believed him !
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 13]: Think of it -- I was hoodwinked by an old peasant . ''
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 3]: `` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 12]: Try and forget things till your broken limb is fixed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 6]: `` What does it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 3]: Confound it !
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 11]: you 've won ; so let me tell my story .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 20]: I must have lost my senses when I saw you and Helen leaving the glacier with two strange guides .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 8]: I forgot all else in my rage .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 8]: I stood there , frozen , bewitched .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 29]: Stampa was watching me all the time , and the instant I turned to revile him he threw me off my balance with a thrust of his ax .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 12]: ` Now you are going to die , Marcus Bauer ! '
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 12]: he said , grinning at me with a lunatic 's joy .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 12]: He even gloated over the unexpected injury I received in falling .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 35]: My groans and cries were so pleasing to him that he did not cut the rope at once as he meant to do , but kept me dangling there , listening to his reproaches .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 43]: Then the stones fell , and pinned him to the ledge ; but not one touched me , and I hauled myself up , broken leg and all , till I crawled on to the big rock that rested on his body .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 8]: You found me there , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 8]: `` Well , I wish you luck .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 19]: I meant to snatch Helen from you , even at the twelfth hour ; but Stampa over-reached me .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 14]: That mock marriage of his contriving had more power than I counted on .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 3]: Curse it !
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 9]: how these crushed bones are beginning to ache !
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 5]: Give me some brandy .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 18]: I want to drink Helen 's health , and my own , and yours , damn you !
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 12]: See that you treat her well and make her life happy !
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 34]: She is worthy of all your love , and I suppose she loves you , whereas I might have striven for years to win her affection and then failed in the end . ''
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 9]: Late that night Spencer arrived at the Maloja .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 17]: Helen was waiting for him , as he had telephoned the hour he might be expected .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 14]: Rumor had brought the news of Stampa 's death and Bower 's accident .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 13]: Then she understood why her lover had sent her away so quickly .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 17]: She was troubled all day , blaming herself as the unconscious cause of so much misery .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 13]: Spencer saw that the full truth alone would dispel her self reproach .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 61]: So he told her everything , even showing her Millicent 's letter and a telegram received from Mackenzie , in which the editor of `` The Firefly '' put it quite plainly that the proprietor of the magazine had forbidden him -LRB- Mackenzie -RRB- from taking any steps whatever with regard to Helen 's return to England without definite instructions .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 46]: The more she learned of the amazing web of intrigue and misunderstanding that surrounded her movements since she left the Embankment Hotel after that memorable luncheon with Millicent , the less inclined she was to deny Spencer 's theory that Fate had brought them together .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 18]: `` I cleared out of Colorado as though a tarantula had bitten me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 46]: `` I traveled five thousand miles to London , saw you , fooled myself into the belief that I was intended by Providence to play the part of a heavy uncle , and kept up that notion during another thousand-mile trip to this delightful country .
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 21]: Then you began to reach out for me , Helen -- '' `` I did nothing of the kind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 3]: she protested .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 36]: `` Oh , yes , you did , -- just grabbed me good and hard , -- and when Bower showed up I stacked my chips on the table and sat down to the game .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 6]: What am I talking about ?
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 19]: Kiss me good night , sweetheart , and do n't you give a red cent who 's looking .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 19]: For once in a way , I do n't mind admitting that I 'm tired -- all in .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 10]: I could sleep on a row of porcupines . ''
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 18]: * * * * * Stampa was buried in the grave that held his daughter 's remains .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 42]: Spencer purchased the space for a suitable monument , and the inscription does not fail to record the fact that one of the men who first conquered the Matterhorn had paid tribute to the mountains by meeting his death on Corvatsch .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 13]: The American went many times to visit Bower at the Roseg inn .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 12]: He found his erstwhile rival resigned to the vagaries of fortune .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 41]: The doctors summoned from St. Moritz deemed his case so serious that they brought a specialist from Paris , and the great surgeon announced that the millionaire 's leg would be saved ; but there must remain a permanent stiffness .
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 16]: `` I know what that means , '' said Bower , with a wry smile .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 8]: `` It is a legacy from Stampa .
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 14]: That is really rather funny , considering that the joke is against myself .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 24]: By the way , did I tell you I gave Millicent Jaques a check for five thousand pounds to stop her tongue ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 14]: `` I guessed the check , but could n't guess the amount . ''
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 17]: `` She wrote last week , threatening all sorts of terrible things because I withheld payment .
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 45]: You will remember that when you and I placed on record our mutual opinion of each other , we agreed at any rate that it was a mean thing on her part to give away our poor Helen to the harpies in the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 23]: So I telegraphed at once to my bankers , and Miss Millicent did n't make good , as you would put it .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 9]: Now she promises to ` expose ' me .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 7]: Humorous , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 20]: `` I think you ought to marry her , '' said Spencer , with that immobile look of his .
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 10]: `` Perhaps I may , one of these days .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 9]: But first she must learn to behave herself .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 6]: A nice girl , Millicent .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 13]: She would look decorative , sitting beside an invalid in a carriage .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 8]: Yes , I 'll think of it .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 18]: Meanwhile , I shall chaff her about the five thousand and see how she takes it . ''
