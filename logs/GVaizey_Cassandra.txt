Parsing [sent. 1 len. 10]: Lady Cassandra , by Mrs George de Horne Vaizey .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 10]: LADY CASSANDRA , BY MRS GEORGE DE HORNE VAIZEY .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 3]: CHAPTER ONE .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 4]: A MATRIMONIAL HURDLE .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 40]: Cassandra Raynor stood on the terrace of her great house , looking over the sweep of country stretching to right and left , and in her heart was the deadliest of all weariness , -- the weariness of repletion .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 36]: It seemed at that moment the bitterest cross that she had nothing left for which to wish , that everything good which the world could give was hers already , and had left her cold .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 35]: The stately old house was hers , with its treasures of old-world furnishings , the same furnishings which had ministered to generations dead and gone , and would minister to others yet to come .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 21]: It would have been considered sacrilege to stamp the individuality of the chatelaine of an hour on those historic halls .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 24]: The distant stretch of country was part of her estate , but the sight of it brought no thrill to Cassandra 's veins .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 32]: Her jaded eyes had wearied of the familiar landscape , as they had wearied of the interior of the house , in which she seemed more a tenant than a mistress .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 64]: Cassandra wandered idly to and fro , obsequiously shadowed by obsequious servants , and wondered what it would feel like to live in a semi-detached villa , and arrange one 's own rooms in one 's own way , and frill pink silk curtains , and festoon lamp shades , and run to the door to meet a husband returning from the City .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 9]: She herself had never run to meet Bernard .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 27]: If she had once begun that sort of thing , she might have been running all day long , for he was always in and out .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 23]: She wondered what it would feel like to have a husband who disappeared regularly at nine a.m. , and returned at seven .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 9]: One might be quite glad to see him !
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 21]: Cassandra had done her duty to the family by producing a healthy male child within eighteen months of her marriage .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 55]: So sorely had she suffered in giving birth to her son that there was no hope of a second child to bear him company , but there had been no regret nor self-pity in her mother 's heart during those first hours in which he lay , red and crumpled , within her arms .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 22]: Never while she lived could Cassandra forget the rest , the thankfulness , the deep , uplifted joy of those hours .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 30]: It had seemed to her then that with the coming of the child all gaps must be filled , and all the poverty of life be turned into gold .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 20]: But ... was it her own fault , or the fault of circumstances which had brought about the disillusionment ?
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 65]: It had been difficult to believe that the stolid , well-behaved young person , who walked abroad between two white-robed nurses , spoke when he was spoken to , and tucked his feeder carefully beneath his chin , was really her own child , bone of her bone , flesh of her flesh ; the wonder child of whom she had dreamt such dreams .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 28]: Cassandra had known nothing of babies ; Mrs Mason , the head nurse , knew everything , and Bernard was tenacious of the safety of his heir .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 22]: He thought it a pity for his wife to `` interfere , '' and said as much with his usual frankness .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 19]: He did not approve of young children being in evidence , and discouraged the boy 's appearance downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 42]: At an unusually early age also he selected a preparatory school at the far end of the county , and henceforth Bernard the younger visited home for the holidays only , and was no longer a member of the household proper .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 17]: Cassandra loved him , but , -- she had wanted to love him so much more !
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 29]: In those first hours she had imagined a bond of union so strong and tender that the commonplaces of the reality could not fail to be a disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 31]: Bernard was a dutiful boy , a sensible boy , a boy who brought home satisfactory reports ; he considered the Mater a good sort , and appreciated her generosity .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 31]: Her affection he endured , her tenderness he would have abhorred , but it was as difficult to be tender to Bernard the son , as to Bernard the father .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 6]: Cassandra had abandoned the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 17]: And , socially speaking , the Court was situated in a hopeless part of the county .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 43]: The other two big places in the neighbourhood were occupied , the one by an objectionable _ nouveau riche _ , and the other by an elderly couple of such strong evangelical tendencies that they disapproved of everything which other people enjoyed .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 41]: There were , it is true , a few pleasant families at the other side of the county , but though they could be counted upon for state occasions , the intervening miles forbade anything like easy , everyday intimacy .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 25]: In autumn the Raynors entertained a succession of guests for the shooting , but for the rest of the year Bernard discouraged house parties .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 35]: He was bored by Cassandra 's friends , she was bored by his , the guests were mutually bored by each other , what then was the use of going to trouble and expense ?
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 60]: As for Chumley , the nearest small township , a mile or less from the nearest gate of the Court , from Cassandra 's point of view `` No-one '' lived there -- literally no one , but a few dull , suburban families who gave afternoon tea parties , gossiped about their neighbours , and wore impossible clothes .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 38]: Cassandra maintained that there was not a creature in Chumley worth knowing , but Bernard said that was nonsense , there must be some decent women among them , if she would only be decent in return !
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 21]: Cassandra maintained that she was decent ; she called on them sometimes , and she asked them to garden parties .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 6]: One could do no more .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 16]: Cassandra had been married ten years , and would be thirty on her next birthday .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 15]: When one was a girl it had seemed so impossibly dull to be thirty .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 25]: And it was ; Cassandra thought it would be vastly more agreeable to be forty , at once , and be done with it .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 34]: At forty , one began to grow stout and grey , to lie down in the afternoon , and feel interested in committee meetings , and societies , and other people 's business .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 12]: At thirty , one was still so painfully interested in oneself !
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 34]: At forty , one _ was _ old , looked it , felt it , acknowledged it with body and mind ... but at thirty , it was difficult to be consistently discreet .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 30]: At thirty , one _ knew _ one was old ; with the brain one knew it , but it was impossible to live consistently up to the knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 41]: There were moments when one felt so extraordinarily , so incredibly young , moments when the mirror , instead of crying shame on such folly , backed one up in delusion , and gave back the reflection of a girl !
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 22]: Cassandra thanked Providence daily for her eyes , her hair , her straight back , and the dimple in her chin .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 20]: Viewed in full , her face was a charming oval ; taken in halves it supplied two admirable profiles .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 33]: The nose leant a trifle to the left , so that was the side on which she chose to be photographed and on which she bestowed the prettiest side of her hats .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 12]: Cassandra and the mirror enjoyed the hats , and Chumley disapproved .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 12]: That was all the satisfaction she got out of their purchase .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 47]: Bernard took no notice of clothes during the enchanting period of their youth , but just when his wife was feeling tired to death of a garment , he would awake to a consciousness of its existence and cry : `` Holloa , what 's this ?
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 5]: You are mighty smart .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 5]: Another new frock ? ''
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 19]: Cassandra wished to goodness as he was not more observant , he would not be observant at all .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 10]: It made it so awkward to order new things .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 36]: Cassandra seated herself in a deep cushioned chair , folded her hands in her lap , and began one of the animated conversations with her inner self which were the resource of her idle hours .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 32]: It was so comfortable talking to oneself , -- one could be honest , could say precisely what one meant , need have no tiresome fears for other people 's susceptibilities .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 15]: `` What 's the matter with me that I feel so restless and dull ?
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 13]: I ought to be contented and happy , but I 'm not .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 20]: I 'm bored to death , and the trouble of it is , -- I ca n't think why !
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 19]: I 've everything I could wish for , and I 'm as unsatisfied as if I 'd nothing .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 16]: In the name of fortune , my dear , _ what do you want _ ?
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 32]: -- It comes to this -- I 'm either a morbid , introspective , weak-minded fool or else I 'm noble and fine , and am stretching out for higher things .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 18]: I 'd like to think it was the last , but I 'm not at all sure !
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 36]: I do n't long to be great or noble , or superior in any way -- only just to be happy , and at rest ... I wonder if by chance I 'm unhappily married ?
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 7]: That would account for so much .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 20]: I wonder if I ruined my life when I gave in , and said ` yes ' to Bernard !
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 11]: If I did , it was with the best intentions .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 8]: I _ was _ fond of him .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 17]: When a dull , quiet man gets really worked up , there 's something extraordinarily compelling .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 11]: And I expected he 'd _ stay _ worked up .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 6]: At eighteen any girl would .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 17]: There ought to be a Bureau of Matrimonial Intelligence to prevent them from making such mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 17]: I 'd be the secretary , and say : ` My dear , he wo n't !
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 7]: This is only a passing conflagration .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 13]: It will die out , and he 'll revert to the normal .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 14]: You 'll have to live with the normal till death do you part .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 11]: It does n't follow that you 'll quarrel ... Ah !
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 11]: my dear girl , there are so many worse things !
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 23]: It 's deplorable , of course , to quarrel with one 's husband , but the reconciliation might be worth the pain .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 26]: You might put your head on his shoulder , and say : `` It was every bit your fault , and the rest was mine .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 3]: Kiss me !
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 9]: and we 'll never do it again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 26]: and he 'd choose the prettiest dimple , and kiss you there , and do it so nicely , you 'd long to quarrel again .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 21]: Oh , yes , there are points about quarrelling , but it 's so hopelessly uningratiating to be -- bored .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 11]: The worse you feel , the less you can say .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 19]: Imagine telling a man that he bored you to extinction , and expecting to be kissed in return !
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 37]: Being bored goes on and on , and never works itself off ' ... Bernard is good and loyal , and honourable , and just , -- and I 'm _ so _ tired of him .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 13]: I _ am _ ; and I ca n't pretend any longer .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 34]: We 've lived together in peace and boredom for ten long years , and something within me seems wearing out -- `` I wonder how many married people come up against this hurdle ?
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 12]: Its name is satiety , and it is bristling with difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 20]: I 've a suspicion that if one could get cleanly over , it would be a safe trot home .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 6]: But it blocks the way .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 28]: I 'm up against it now -- '' Cassandra rested an elbow on the arm of her chair , and leant her head on the uplifted hand .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 11]: A thrill of something like fear ran through her veins .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 25]: The simile of the hurdle had leapt into her mind subconsciously , as such things will , but the conscious mind recognised its face .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 42]: Along the quiet path lay no chance for the reforming of life ; it must necessarily be some shock , some upheaval , which would either open out new fields , or gild the old with some of the vanished splendour .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 21]: Even if one failed to reach the goal without a toss , a toss was preferable to an eternal jog-trot .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 49]: Cassandra narrowed her eyes , and stared into space , but no man 's face pictured itself in her mind ; for ten long years Bernard had , for good or ill , filled the foreground of her life , not the mildest of flirtations had been hers .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 23]: She was a pure-minded woman , bred on conventional lines , and the idea of a lover would have outraged her delicacy .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 19]: In considering the events which might possibly vitalise the future , her mind dwelt on strictly legitimate happenings .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 34]: A serious illness , -- her own , -- Bernard 's , -- the boy 's ; the loss of money ; a lengthened separation , which would revive joys staled by custom .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 17]: Regarded dispassionately the prospects were not cheerful , nevertheless she found herself cheered by the contemplation .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 18]: She saw herself occupied , engrossed , with something to do , a real object in life .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 35]: It might be a reviving experience to have one of the Bernards -- not dangerously so , of course , but just enough ill to feel dependent on the one woman in the family .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 9]: Even to be ill oneself would have points .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 39]: She would sit propped up against her best pillow covers , wearing a distracting bed jacket and cap , and Bernard would come in , and look at her , and say , -- What would he say ?
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 10]: Cassandra 's smile was twisted with a pathetic humour .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 6]: `` Holloa , old girl .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 7]: Got 'em _ all _ on !
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 9]: Bucking up a bit , ai n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 25]: I 'm off for a ride ... '' Rather a tame denouement to which to look forward as the reward for weeks of suffering !
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 12]: Cassandra determined on the whole that she would rather keep well .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 14]: And the two Bernards , -- what sort of convalescents would they make ?
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 51]: Cassandra drew a mental picture of the sick room , with the older patient stretched on a couch , and herself seated by his side , a devoted and assiduous nurse , but there was an obstinate commonplaceness about father and son which refused to adapt itself to the scene .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 35]: Bernard would have no reflections to make on the wonder of life restored ; he would want to hear the _ Sporting Times _ read aloud , and the latest news of the crops .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 19]: His tenderest acknowledgment of her care would be a , `` Looking a bit peaked , old girl !
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 15]: What 's the sense of paying a nurse and doing the work yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 20]: As for the boy , he would talk cricket , be politely bored , and surreptitiously wipe off kisses .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 15]: Cassandra determined that on the whole the two Bernards had better keep well also !
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 53]: As for poverty -- one would certainly have enough to do to run a house on a few hundreds a year , but though viewed generally the prospect sounded picturesque , a definite narrowing down to a comparison with one of the many Chumley homesteads , brought a quick shudder of distaste .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 32]: The narrow rooms , the inferior servants , the infinitesimal gardens , -- Cassandra thrust out her hands in horror of the thought , and laughed a soft , full-throated laugh .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 20]: `` If I am bound to be dissatisfied , let me at least have room to be dissatisfied in !
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 14]: I could bear being stinted in almost anything rather than _ space _ .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 25]: If Bernard loses his money , we 'll go abroad and live on a prairie , -- anything rather than a stifling villa . ''
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 26]: She turned her head as the door opened , and her husband entered , and crossed the room to a bureau in the far corner .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 24]: He wore the usual tweed suit , the Norfolk jacket accentuating his increasing width , the loose knickerbockers revealing large , well-shaped legs .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 37]: His skin was tanned to a rich brown , his eyes were a clear hard blue , his teeth strong and white , his moustache was cut in a straight harsh line along the upper lip .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 32]: His cool gaze included his wife with the rest of the furnishings , but he gave no acknowledgment of her presence ; not a flicker of expression passed over his face .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 16]: There came to Cassandra suddenly , irrepressibly , the necessity of shocking him into life .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 28]: She was not a woman who indulged in scenes ; it came naturally to her to hide her feelings , and act a part before the world .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 60]: If Bernard had not entered at just that psychological moment , if he had looked one bit less sleek , and satisfied , and dense , she could have gone on acting , as she had done for years past ; as it was , a desire for expression rose with giant force , and would not be gainsaid .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 3]: Very well !
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 4]: So be it .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 12]: For once she would speak out , and Bernard should hear .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 15]: She had an acute , a devastating curiosity to hear what he would say .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 7]: `` Bernard , are you busy ?
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 8]: I want to speak to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 5]: He turned his head .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 20]: The clear tints of his skin looked startlingly healthy as seen in the light of the great open window .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 4]: `` All right !
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 4]: Fire ahead . ''
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 9]: `` Bernard , do you love me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 5]: `` Good Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 23]: The utter stupefaction on Raynor 's face proved that this was the last of all questions which he had expected to hear .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 16]: He came across the room , and stood staring down into his wife 's face .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 8]: `` What the dickens is up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 5]: `` Nothing is up .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 7]: I asked you a simple question .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 6]: What should be up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 14]: `` I thought you 'd taken offence at something I 'd done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 14]: `` You have done nothing in the least unusual that I know of .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 6]: I rather wish you had .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 8]: _ Do _ you , Bernard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 6]: `` Do I what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 18]: `` You know quite well , but I 'll ask you again , if you prefer it .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 8]: Do you love me , Bernard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 10]: The man 's ruddy face took a deeper tinge .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 11]: `` I say , Cass , what rot is this ?
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 9]: That was settled and done with years ago .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 4]: I married you .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 5]: You 're my wife .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 17]: If you are not sure of me by this time , you never will be . ''
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 9]: `` You are quite sure of yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 6]: `` Of course I am .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 4]: What d'you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 32]: I 'm not the sort to er -- er -- '' Cassandra turned her head over her shoulder and flung him a challenging glance , her blue eyes bright with defiance .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 22]: `` Then you had better understand , Bernard , once for all , that -- I am not sure of myself !
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 14]: I 'm not at all sure that I love _ you _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 5]: She had said it .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 12]: The words rang like a clarion call through the silent room .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 20]: After years of self-deception , and careful covering up , a moment 's impulse had laid bare the skeleton .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 14]: It stood between them , a naked horror , grinning with fleshless lips .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 18]: Cassandra saw it and shuddered at the sight , but it was too late to draw back .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 14]: She caught her breath , and sat tremblingly waiting for what should come .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 11]: What came was a burst of hearty , good-natured laughter .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 10]: Bernard 's eyes twinkled , his white teeth gleamed .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 15]: He stretched out a freckled hand and laid it on his wife 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 9]: `` That 's all right , old girl !
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 7]: Do n't you worry about that .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 14]: You 're fond of me all right , and a rattling good wife .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 14]: We 've been married a dozen years , and never had a row .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 18]: If all couples got along as well as we do , things would be a sight better .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 14]: What 's the use of bothering about love at this time of day .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 7]: I 'm not a sentimental fellow .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 9]: I 'm satisfied with things as they are .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 9]: So are you too , as a rule .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 11]: Got a fit of the blues , that 's all !
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 29]: -- I say , Cass , Peignton 's coming to tea , and I met that girl of the Mallison 's , -- Teresa , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 16]: -- and asked her to come along too , and make up a game afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 20]: She plays a good hand , and Peignton 's engaged to her they say , or going to be .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 15]: So we will do them a good turn , as well as ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 14]: Cassandra rose slowly , straightening her shoulders as if throwing off a weight .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 31]: Standing there her head was on a level with her husband 's , and for a moment their eyes met , his calm and unperturbed , hers sparkling and defiant .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 4]: She had spoken .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 15]: He had heard the truth , and had laughed at her for her pains .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 9]: Now let the Fates bring what they might .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 11]: He had been warned ... `` Very well , Bernard .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 6]: I 'll have tea early .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 11]: Shall I order the car to take her home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 5]: `` Er -- no .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 4]: They 'll send .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 9]: Pony cart or some contraption of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 9]: Peignton 'll look after her all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 17]: He chuckled , aroused to interest in a prospective romance , though his own had faded .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 22]: He turned , softly whistling , and fumbled in the bureau , while Cassandra beat a retreat to her own room .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 16]: Now she was angry with herself , sore with the humiliation of an unnecessary rebuff .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 6]: `` How futile of me !
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 10]: How superfluous to bring it on my own head !
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 6]: What did I expect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 5]: she asked herself bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 28]: She stood staring out of the window at the landscape , already darkening in the short February light , while the thoughts chased themselves in her brain .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 26]: Her youth , -- Bernard , -- her marriage , -- the birth of her child , -- ennui , -- disappointment , -- emptiness .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 20]: The different stages seemed to follow one after another in relentless sequence ; they merged together in nebulous confusion .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 9]: Then suddenly her thoughts switched to another topic .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 4]: `` Teresa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 10]: she found herself repeating , `` Teresa Mallison ! ''
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 31]: With critical accuracy she was conjuring up the picture of a tall , thickly built girl , with fair hair , fresh complexion , and a narrow , long-chinned face .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 34]: In Chumley circles Teresa Mallison was considered a pretty girl , and pretty she was , and would be , so long as the glow of youth disguised the harshness of her features .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 29]: Cassandra acknowledged as much with the generosity which most women show towards the attractions of their sisters , difficult as masculine incredulity finds it to credit the fact .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 27]: Teresa Mallison was quite a pleasant sort of girl , amiable and unaffected , and quite angelic about accepting eleventh-hour invitations to fill a vacant place .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 36]: One way and another she had been a fairly frequent visitor at the Court , during the last year , but imagine _ choosing _ to live all one 's life with such a companion !
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 82]: Imagine breakfasting throughout the years with Teresa Mallison as a _ vis-a-vis _ ; being sad with Teresa , glad with Teresa , living day after day with Teresa ; growing old , dying , always , always with Teresa ; watching her heavy form grow heavier , her long face longer , seeing the wrinkles gather round the light blue eyes , listening always , for ever , to the thin , toneless voice , the recurrent spasms of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 9]: Dane Peignton too ; Peignton of all men !
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 19]: Not one of the ordinary , uninteresting Chumley natives , but the most attractive bachelor in the neighbourhood !
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 6]: That made the mystery deeper .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 42]: Dane Peignton was a comparatively new-comer to the neighbourhood ; was in fact only a bird of passage , being a temporary tenant of a small place a few miles distant from the Court , during its owner 's sojourn abroad .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 63]: Peignton had retired from the Army after a serious breakdown in health , and being not overburdened with this world 's goods , had been delighted to accept from old friends the loan of a house for a couple of years , the responsibility of superintending the up-keep of the estate being taken as a _ quid pro quo _ against rent .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 51]: Being country-bred , he had little difficulty in fitting into his new duties , and in envisaging the future , felt that after Vernon 's return , he would like nothing better than to secure a land agency , live quietly in the country , and take up country sports .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 20]: Given a few congenial neighbours , and a library of books , he would feel no hankerings for town .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 21]: An hour later Cassandra descended the great staircase , and made her way to the drawing-room to await her guests .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 33]: She had discarded her morning dress , and moved by some subtle impulse of coquetry had decked herself in a new creation , which was pleased to call itself a bridge gown .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 28]: Even she herself would have been puzzled to give an accurate explanation of her own motives in so doing ; so many elements entered , and intermingled .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 17]: Bernard had repulsed her , -- let him see what manner of woman he had repulsed !
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 28]: The remembrance of the girl , rich in youth and love , came also as a spur to the woman to whom the years had brought disillusion .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 43]: Teresa Mallison had placed her on a pinnacle , and worshipped her as a marvel of grace and beauty , -- she wished to retain the girl 's admiration , wished for her own sake to feel conscious of looking her best .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 29]: She dressed for Bernard 's benefit , for Teresa 's , for her own ; the only person of whom she took no account was Dane Peignton himself .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 6]: He stood outside her life .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 39]: The great drawing-room with its white panelled walls looked somewhat cold and austere , but round the log fire was a little haven of comfort , where four Spanish leather screens formed a background for deeply cushioned sofas .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 49]: The firelight played on the rich colouring of the old leather work , on the dainty equipments of the tea table ; on Cassandra herself in her rose-red draperies , on the face , that was so young and vivid , on the eyes which were so tired .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 38]: Dane Peignton approaching from the further end of the room had a moment to take in the details of the scene , before she saw him in her turn , and the picture stayed in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 35]: Cassandra on her part regarded Peignton with the added curiosity which every woman feels towards an embryo lover , seeing him in a new light , as a central figure in the eternal drama .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 41]: She saw a tall man with a military bearing , somewhat at variance with bowed shoulders , a clean-shaven face , not handsome , not plain , the features large and roughly hewn , the eyes a dark steel grey .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 5]: Yet he was attractive .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 6]: Why was he so attractive ?
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 19]: Cassandra pondered the question while keeping up a light flow of conversation , and arrived at varying conclusions .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 5]: It was his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 5]: It was his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 7]: It was his mobility of expression .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 15]: It was an air of weakness underlying strength , which evoked sympathy and interest .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 21]: He _ was _ attractive , that was the end of the matter ; and he cared for Teresa Mallison !
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 9]: The door opened , and Teresa was announced .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 33]: She had discarded her coat and appeared in a short dark skirt , and a white blouse , transparent at the neck , and displaying a goodly length of bare brown arms .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 21]: Her feet looked disproportionately large in walking shoes , and there was a hint of the provincial in her gait .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 22]: One descried at a glance that it was not often her lot to make an entrance into so stately a room .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 12]: Cassandra rose to greet her with an involuntary feeling of commiseration .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 28]: A few minutes before she had come near grudging the girl her good fortune , now at the sight of her , her heart melted with pity .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 8]: So _ gauche _ , so raw !
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 8]: The heavy looks , the reddened arms .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 24]: Cassandra 's fastidious eye took in the blemishes at a glance , and the feminine in her rose on the girl 's behalf .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 40]: She placed her on the corner of the sofa , nearest the softly tinted light , moved a table to her side , with a deft hand twitched away a dark cushion and substituted one of a vivid blue .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 49]: The effect was transforming , for once the dark skirt was hidden from sight the filmy blouse became at once dainty and appropriate , while the softened light showed to advantage the gleam in the fair , coiled hair , the youthful pink and white of the complexion .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 29]: Cassandra glanced at Peignton to see if he appreciated the picture ; and discovered him leaning forward , looking into the girl 's face with pleasure and admiration .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 12]: Teresa was smiling back , and showing her large white teeth .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 18]: Cassandra squeezed her lips into a tight little knot , and told herself she was very pleased .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 8]: But _ how foolish _ they looked !
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 11]: Bernard came in , and sat himself down with deliberation .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 21]: He enjoyed afternoon tea , insisted on having a table to himself , and a supply of hot buttered toast .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 24]: Hardly a day passed that he did not ask for a second supply , and give instructions as to liberality with the butter .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 14]: He drank three cups of tea , and helped himself largely to cream .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 9]: And then he wondered that he grew stout !
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 22]: Cassandra nibbled daintily at minute wafers of bread , and the girl on the sofa ate sweet cakes with youthful relish .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 10]: `` What 's the news , Miss Mallison ? ''
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 8]: Bernard asked between his mouthfuls of toast .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 24]: It was a question which he never failed to ask , and Teresa Mallison 's replies never failed to evoke the expected amusement .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 30]: She believed so implicitly that he was interested in the doings of that dead-alive little hole , and brought out her little items with such an air of importance .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 14]: `` The Vicar has asked me to decorate the chancel for Easter . ''
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 7]: `` Do n't you do it !
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 8]: Lots of trouble , and nobody pleased .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 8]: Let someone else take that job . ''
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 15]: `` Oh , but '' -- Teresa looked shocked -- `` I want to !
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 5]: It 's an honour .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 8]: I 've only done the finials before .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 7]: But it needs lots of flowers .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 12]: I wondered if ... '' `` I 'll bet you did !
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 5]: They always do . ''
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 4]: Bernard laughed good-naturedly .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 12]: `` All right , Miss Teresa ; you shall have them .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 17]: Someone has them every year , and I 'd sooner give them to you than most .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 14]: Tell Dawes what you want , and I 'll see that he remembers .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 15]: And if you want him to help -- '' `` Oh , thanks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 8]: Teresa 's cheeks showed a deeper colour .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 6]: `` I have some helpers .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 6]: Mr Peignton has promised . ''
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 7]: `` That 's right , Peignton !
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 5]: Make yourself useful . ''
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 18]: Bernard 's smile was so significant , that Teresa made haste to give the conversation a turn .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 9]: `` The Martin Beverleys have come home . ''
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 7]: `` They have , have they ?
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 26]: That 's the author fellow who married the heiress , who was not an heiress , because she gave it all up to marry him .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 9]: Chucked away , -- how much was it ?
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 6]: Fifty thousand a year ? ''
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 4]: `` Thirty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 9]: `` Ah well , thirty 's good enough !
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 21]: He did n't seem to me , the few times I 've met him , exactly cheap at the price .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 21]: Good-looking enough in a fashion , and plays a fair game , but a stiff , reserved kind of beggar .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 8]: Takes himself too seriously for my taste .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 9]: They tell me he writes good books . ''
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 10]: Teresa waxed eloquent in favour of the local celebrity .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 5]: `` Oh , beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 8]: He is one of the best authors .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 9]: The last one was the best of all .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 7]: It 's run through several editions .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 10]: You ought to read it , Mr Raynor . ''
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 7]: `` Ca n't stick novels ! ''
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 16]: declared Bernard , who was never known to read a line beyond the morning papers .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 15]: `` Ca n't understand how anyone can when they 've passed the cub stage .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 9]: And as to writing them -- Good Lord !
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 12]: Fancy that old solemn sides Beverley writing an impassioned love scene !
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 10]: Beats me how he manages to do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 12]: `` It would n't , if you knew Mrs Beverley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 4]: Teresa said sagely .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 13]: Her blue eyes brightened , she drew a long , eloquent breath .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 7]: `` She is -- adorable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 4]: The men laughed .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 9]: Cassandra looked up with a dawning of interest .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 13]: `` She was Grizel Dundas , niece of that terrible old woman .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 12]: I 've heard of her often , but we never met .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 26]: I 've met Mr Beverley and his sister , that handsome girl who went to India : they have been here to several garden parties .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 19]: He is certainly rather stiff , but one feels from his books that he must be worth knowing .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 26]: It 's interesting to know a man for whom a woman has given up so much , but still more interesting to meet the woman .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 11]: Tell us , Teresa , what she is like ! ''
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 12]: But Teresa wrinkled her brows , and looked vague and perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 13]: She could enthuse , but it appeared that she could not describe .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 8]: `` Er -- it 's so difficult !
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 7]: She 's like no one else .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 14]: I 've never met anyone in the _ least _ like her . ''
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 12]: Cassandra put the invariable question : `` Is she pretty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 6]: `` Oh , lovely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 3]: Teresa cried .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 6]: `` At least -- sometimes !
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 3]: She changes .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 8]: I 've heard people call her plain .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 8]: But you hardly think of her looks .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 15]: She 's so -- '' Again she hesitated , and became lost in confusion .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 5]: Cassandra probed once more .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 7]: `` So -- _ what _ ?
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 7]: Teresa , do please be definite !
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 8]: I 'm interested in this Mrs Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 16]: If she 's really plain , it 's so clever of her to look lovely .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 15]: If she is lovely , it 's so stupid of her to look plain .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 9]: _ What _ is she so -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 4]: `` Funny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 7]: gasped Teresa , and giggled triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 9]: `` Yes , she _ is _ funny !
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 5]: She says funny things .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 5]: In a funny way .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 16]: She is not a bit like -- '' `` Teresa -- _ what _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 16]: `` Chumley , '' said Teresa , and involuntarily Cassandra heaved a sigh of relief .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 3]: `` Lovely .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 2]: Plain .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 2]: Funny .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 7]: Not a bit like Chumley . ''
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 19]: Cassandra noted each point with an infinitesimal nod ; into her eyes there danced a spark of light .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 5]: `` This sounds exciting !
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 8]: I shall call upon Mrs Beverley . ''
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 7]: `` Thankful to hear it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 3]: Raynor grumbled .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 9]: `` You ought to call a lot more .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 4]: People expect it .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 11]: It would please 'em , and be good for you .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 9]: You shut yourself up , and get hipped .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 11]: A woman needs gossip , to let off steam . ''
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 36]: Cassandra 's light laugh carried off the personality of the remark , but after the laugh came a sigh , a ghost of a sigh of whose passing her husband and Teresa remained serenely unconscious .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 15]: Only Peignton heard it , and his eyes turned to rest upon her face .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 19]: There was in his glance an intentness , an understanding which gave the impression of barriers thrust aside .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 9]: Cassandra was startled by it , and discomposed .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 14]: She had reached the stage when she did not expect to be understood .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 20]: That such a stranger as this man should have read her thoughts seemed at the moment a deliberate offence .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 10]: She lowered her lids with an impulse of self-defence .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 11]: `` It is five o'clock , '' she said shortly .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 18]: `` Bernard , if you can tear yourself from buttered toast , shall we begin bridge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWO .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 5]: WANTED -- A WIFE .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 12]: It was a pretty sight to see Cassandra Raynor play bridge .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 61]: When dummy fell to her turn , she had a trick of stretching out her right hand , and softly tapping the table , during a moment 's deliberation , which gave the onlookers an opportunity of admiring what is certainly one of the most beautiful of created objects , an exquisitely made , exquisitely tended , woman 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 44]: There was but one ring on the hand , a square-cut emerald , surrounded by diamonds , and the milky whiteness of the skin , the flash of the emerald against the dull green of the baize , were charming things to behold .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 20]: Peignton sent a keen glance of enquiry into Cassandra 's face , and felt relieved to behold its absorption .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 30]: She was thinking entirely of the game ; the beauty of her hand was to her an accepted fact ; the gesture was actuated by no promptings of vanity .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 55]: A few minutes later when Teresa imitated the gesture , as she had fallen into the habit of imitating Cassandra in a dozen small ways , Peignton stared assiduously at his cards , but there was an extra empressment in the voice in which he congratulated the girl at the end of the game .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 20]: He felt the same tender commiseration which a parent knows at the sight of a blemish on a child .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 11]: Rough luck on a girl to have such ugly hands !
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 12]: Subconsciously his mind registered a vow never to give her emeralds .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 47]: During a term of service abroad Peignton had met few women , and those of an uncongenial type , but now he wished to marry , and for some time past had been consciously regarding every girl he met in the light of a future wife .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 21]: He was not romantic in his requirements -- few men are , when they deliberately set about such a search .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 41]: He wanted a wife because he was thirty-five , and not too strong , and if he ever settled down it was time he did it , and a fellow felt lonely having no one to think of but himself .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 45]: He wanted a girl about twenty-five -- not younger than that , -- healthy and cheerful , and fond of a country life , and , after eight months ' residence in Chumley , it appeared to him that Teresa Mallison filled the bill .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 35]: She was the prettiest and most sporting girl in the neighbourhood ; he met her on one excuse or another several times a week , and considered complacently that he was falling in love .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 55]: Teresa did not consider at all , -- she would have been hanged and quartered for him at any moment of any day ; she was prepared to do , what is far more difficult -- marry him on a minute income , keep house with insufficient help , and rear a large family .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 12]: Teresa 's tastes were modern , but her heart was Victorian .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 24]: She looked up to Peignton as a god and hero , and prayed daily to be permitted to serve him on her knees .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 37]: Also , being Victorian in modesty , she prayed with scarcely less fervour that `` unless he asked her '' he might never suspect her love , and comported herself in the spirit of that prayer .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 24]: Therefore Peignton considered that she was ignorant of his designs , and told himself that there was no hurry , -- no hurry .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 7]: It was better to go slow .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 46]: This was the first informal occasion on which Peignton had visited the Court and seen Cassandra in the intimacy of a _ partie carree _ , and before the first hour was over he had found it necessary to readjust many impressions concerning his hostess .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 9]: First , she was younger than he imagined .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 51]: When she smiled , or made little grimaces of disgust at incidents in the play , or lifted her eyebrows at him appealingly on the commission of a fault , she was not a great lady any more , she was a girl , like the girl by her side .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 7]: Secondly , she was less beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 71]: He had seen her at stately dinner parties , gorgeously gowned , a tiara flashing on her dark head , and had believed her to be faultless of feature ; but she was not faultless , her nose deviated noticeably from the straight , her mouth was too large ; on a nearer view the classical beauty disappeared , but her place was taken by a woman infinitely more alluring .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 21]: He admired in especial the poise of the little head , and the way in which she dressed her hair .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 38]: It was parted in the middle , dipped low on the forehead , and then swept upwards , and in some mysterious fashion became a thick plait which encircled her head , like a victor 's crown .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 51]: There seemed no beginning or end to that plait , so deftly was it woven , and to the onlooker it appeared as if a Midas finger had laid a gentle touch on each entwining braid , so brightly shone out the golden tints in the brown , burnished hair .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 27]: Peignton had never seen dark hair show such brilliant lights ; he thought that wreath-like plait with the golden lights more beautiful than a hundred tiaras .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 11]: Why did not all women wear their hair like that ?
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 13]: And her figure too -- there was something beguiling about her figure .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 19]: The softly swathed folds of silk suggested neither dressmaker nor corsetiere , but a warm , living woman .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 15]: Her neck was as white as her hand ... `` Steam ahead , Peignton .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 7]: We 're waiting for your declaration .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 9]: What are you dreaming about , man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 6]: `` Do n't ask me .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 13]: I could n't tell you , '' Peignton replied , truthfully enough .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 18]: He had been wondering how the deuce a woman like that had come to marry Bernard Raynor !
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 20]: Teresa played a good steady game , and forbore to chatter , a fact duly appreciated by her host .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 7]: Cassandra was alternately brilliant and careless .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 25]: At times looking across the table Peignton could see her eyes grow absent and misty , and suspected thoughts far removed from the play .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 17]: Then he would wait with anticipated pleasure the deprecatory grimace , the penitent , appealing glance .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 26]: At seven o'clock Miss Mallison 's carriage was announced , and Teresa exhibited a dutiful daughter 's unwillingness `` to keep the horse waiting . ''
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 38]: In the great hall she slid her arms into a Burberry coat , pulled a knitted cap over her head , and passing out of the porch sprang lightly to the front seat of a shabby dog-cart .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 40]: The coachman , shabby to match , stood at the horse 's head , and as Peignton took his place , looked on with an impenetrability which denoted that this was not the first time he had been superseded .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 21]: Then he in his turn climbed to a back seat , and the horse trotted off down the dark avenue .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 23]: Teresa had looked forward with keenest anticipation to this moment when she and Dane would sit quietly together in the friendly dark .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 46]: There was no expectation of love-making in her mind , far less of a formal declaration ; she was content just to sit by his side , and leaning back in her seat be able to gaze her fill at the strong , dark form .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 41]: On a previous occasion he had given her the reins to hold while he lit a cigarette , and the picture of his face illumined by the tiny flame of the match would remain for life in her mental gallery .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 9]: She hoped he would light a cigarette to-night .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 35]: If the inchoate thoughts of the girl 's mind could have been translated into words at that moment , they would have made a poem , but Teresa had not the gift of expression .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 21]: She asked herself several times what she should `` talk about , '' before at last she broke the silence .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 14]: `` You see it _ did _ pay to discard from strength ! ''
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 3]: Peignton laughed .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 30]: The point had been disputed between the two times and again , but he felt an amused admiration of the manner in which the girl held to her point .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 19]: To-night his remembrance of the game was hazy , but Teresa as the victor was entitled to complaisance .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 6]: `` You played rattling well .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 4]: You always do .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 10]: I never knew a woman less miserly of trumps .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 8]: Do you know Lady Cassandra well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 7]: `` I -- think so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 7]: Doubt lingered in Teresa 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 7]: `` They ask me fairly often .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 5]: She 's very kind .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 9]: Of course , we 're not -- intimate .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 7]: She 's so much older . ''
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 5]: `` Is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 15]: Peignton asked , and was happily unaware of his companion 's flush of displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 6]: `` She looks very young .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 11]: It must be lonely for her in that big place .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 11]: I 'm glad she has you for a friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 11]: His voice softened as he spoke the last , words .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 44]: He turned his head to cast a smiling glance at the girl 's figure , and the thought came to his mind that just in this simple , unpretentious fashion would they drive back to their joint home during the years to come .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 29]: It would not run to more than a cart , but she had not been used to luxury , and was quite content in her Burberry and cap .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 9]: It was not like marrying a society woman .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 13]: Heaven knows what fallals Lady Cassandra would don for a like occasion .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 27]: Peignton admired `` fallals , '' meaning by the term dainty , feminine accessories , as all men do , apart from the question of price .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 34]: He could not for his life have described Cassandra 's costume that evening , but it had left its impression as a mysterious floating thing , infinitely removed from the garments of men .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 5]: Teresa was essentially tailor-made .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 13]: A good thing too , for the wife of a poor man !
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 12]: `` I wonder what on earth made her many him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 13]: `` Made her -- '' Teresa 's blue eyes widened in astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 4]: `` Lady Cassandra ?
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 9]: Because she loved him , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 6]: `` Is it of course ?
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 12]: Are there no other reasons for marriage , Miss Teresa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 7]: `` There ought not to be .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 7]: There are not ... in Chumley .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 9]: But of course we are not smart . ''
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 8]: Peignton was once more unconscious of offence .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 15]: `` Still , it 's sometimes difficult to fit the theory to individual cases !
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 22]: Do you never look at the couples around you , and wonder how on earth they came to fancy each other ?
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 13]: I believe many of them wonder themselves before a year is past .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 10]: I ca n't imagine Lady Cassandra choosing Raynor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 7]: `` Mr Raynor is very nice .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 6]: He is a good landlord .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 7]: People like him very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 6]: `` I like him myself .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 10]: He 's a very excellent specimen of his type .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 18]: I 'm not depreciating Raynor as a man -- only as a husband for one particular wife .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 17]: She 's everything that is vivid and alive , he 's everything that 's -- slow !
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 10]: It 's a mystery how she took him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 18]: `` Perhaps , '' Teresa said shrewdly , `` he was n't so slow _ then _ !
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 11]: He was in love with her , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 36]: She used the past tense in placid acceptance of an obvious fact ; Peignton accepted it also , his curiosity concerning the Raynors eclipsed by a tinge of jealousy aroused by the girl 's words .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 16]: She seemed to understand a good deal of the behaviour of a man in love !
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 8]: How did she come by her knowledge ?
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 19]: He had thought the coast clear , but was it possible that one of those local fellows -- ?
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 24]: Man-like , his interest was quickened by the suspicion , and Teresa gained in value at the thought of another man 's admiration .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 32]: There was unmistakable inflection in the tone of his next words : `` When _ I _ am married , I shall hope to remain in love with my wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 9]: Teresa straightened herself , and forced a cough .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 26]: She was in terror lest the shabby groom might overhear the words , and repeat them for the benefit of the maids in the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes , of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 4]: she said lightly .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 19]: `` That is so nice ... Then you _ will _ come , and help with the decorations ?
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 10]: One needs a man to reach the high places .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 10]: The Vicar wo n't allow a single nail . ''
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 7]: `` Yes , I 'll come .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 6]: I 'd like to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 3]: Peignton said .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 34]: He smiled to himself in the dusk at the thought of standing before the altar in the old church , side by side with Teresa Mallison , her hands heaped with white flowers .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 29]: He wondered if to her , as to him , would come the thought that there might come another occasion when they would stand there for another purpose .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 34]: As the horse trotted up to the door of Major Mallison 's house , he was mentally seeing a picture of Teresa in her wedding robes , a gauzy veil covering her head .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 45]: A moment later as they bade each other goodnight , the light through the opened door fell full upon the face of the real Teresa in her Burberry and knitted cap , and looking at her , Peignton felt a sudden stab of disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 14]: The familiar features seemed in mysterious fashion other than those he had expected .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 15]: Faults of which he had been happily unconscious , obtruded themselves upon his notice .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 14]: It was almost as if he looked upon the face of a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 22]: He walked down the deserted street pondering the mystery , and like other unimaginative men , failed to find an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 14]: How could it have been possible that he had dreamed of another face ?
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 3]: CHAPTER THREE .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 3]: HOUSEHOLD WORDS .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 14]: Marten Beverley and his wife Grizel confronted each other across the breakfast table .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 22]: Only the night before they had returned from a protracted , wedding tour , to take possession of their new home .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 16]: Each was superbly , gloriously happy , but there was a difference in their happiness .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 40]: Martin was not tired of play , but the zest for work was making itself felt , and he looked forward with joy to the hours at his desk which would give extra delight to the play to follow .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 12]: Grizel faced work also , but faced it with a grimace .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 17]: How in the world to settle down , and to be practical , and keep house ?
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 8]: `` Here beginneth the second volume ! ''
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 8]: she chanted dolefully across the breakfast table .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 13]: `` The happy couple return from their honeymoon , and settle down !
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 3]: ... Martin !
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 10]: I do n't _ want _ to settle down .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 4]: Why should one ?
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 14]: It 's out of date , anyhow , to have a second volume .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 14]: Nowadays people live at full pressure , and get it over in one .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 18]: Let 's go on being foolish , and irresponsible , and taking no thought for our dinner .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 7]: It 's the only sensible plan .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 8]: And it would prevent so much disappointment !
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 21]: I 'm a daisy as a honeymoon wife , but I 'm _ not _ a typical British Matron . ''
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 8]: `` You do n't look it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 29]: said Martin , and thrusting his hands in his pockets , tilted back in his chair and sat staring across the table , his eyes alight with admiration .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 18]: A fire blazed in the grate , but Grizel 's morning robe suggested the height of summer .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 20]: It was composed of some sort of white woollen material , which showed glimpses of a delicate pink lining .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 20]: She wore a boudoir cap too , a concoction of lace and pink ribbon at once rakish and demure .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 30]: Martin was certain that she looked a duck , what he was uncertain about was the suitability of such plumage for the mistress of a small _ menage _ .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 44]: Had he not kept house for eight years with a sister who had visited the larder every morning , and kept a stern eye on stock-pot and bread-pan , clad in the triggest of blouses , and the shortest of plain serge skirts !
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 6]: His eyes twinkled with amusement .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 18]: `` Is it your intention to visit the scullery in those garments , may I ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 15]: Grizel tilted in her turn , and returned his stare with an enchanting smile .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 17]: She looked young and fresh , and adorably dainty ; an ideal bride _ deluxe _ .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 24]: `` In the first place , '' she said , dimpling , `` what precisely is , and does -- a scullery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 21]: `` A scullery , my child , is an apartment approximate to , and an accessory of , a kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 22]: It is equipped with a sink , and is designed for the accommodation of pots and pans , brushes and brooms .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 9]: Likewise boots , and er -- uncooked vegetables .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 20]: Every mistress of a small establishment visits the kitchen and scullery at least once in the twenty-four hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 10]: Grizel considered the subject , thoughtfully rubbing her nose .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 5]: `` Why vegetables ? ''
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 6]: `` Why not ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 8]: _ With _ brushes and boots ? ''
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 8]: `` It seems unsuitable , I grant .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 4]: But they do .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 11]: I 've seen them when I 've been locking up .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 4]: On the floor .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 5]: In a wooden box .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 11]: Carrots and turnips , and potatoes in their skins . ''
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 10]: Grizel straightened herself determinedly , and attacked her breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 11]: `` I shall _ never _ visit the scullery ! ''
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 4]: she said firmly .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 7]: `` It would spoil my appetite .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 12]: Thank you so much for warning me , ducky doo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 5]: `` Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 5]: It was an exhortation .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 8]: The cook will expect it of you .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 4]: So shall I .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 8]: You must kindly remember the sink . ''
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 8]: `` I take your word for it .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 4]: Suppose there is ?
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 14]: What in the name of fortune has it to do with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 8]: `` It 's your sink , Madam .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 6]: Part of your new-found responsibilities .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 17]: I do n't wish to harrow your susceptibilities , but it might not be kept clean .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 11]: It is for you to see that it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 12]: `` You should have told me that afore , Laddie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 4]: warbled Grizel reproachfully .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 13]: `` Nobody never warned me I should have to poke about sinks !
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 6]: And I wo n't neither .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 8]: It 's a waste of skilled labour .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 19]: Are n't there lots of sanitary kind of people who make their living by that sort of work ?
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 10]: Let 's have one to look after ours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 5]: `` Every morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 4]: `` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 9]: Every evening too , if you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 16]: Martin burst into a roar of laughter , and stretched a hand across the table .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 13]: `` You 're a goose , Grizel ; an impracticable little goose .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 13]: I 'm afraid we shall never make a Martha of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 15]: Then suddenly his face fell , and the caressing touch strengthened into a grasp .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 14]: `` You should n't have to do it , '' he cried sharply .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 6]: `` It is n't fair .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 37]: You 've been a miracle of generosity to me , darling , but when it comes to facing the stern realities of life , I wonder if I ought to have let you do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 12]: `` You could n't help yourself , '' Grizel said calmly .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 14]: `` I asked you , and you could n't for shame say no .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 8]: Give me back my hand , dear .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 9]: I want it , to go on eating .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 36]: I do love having breakfast with you in our very own house , and I must make it last as long as possible , as I sha n't see you again for four whole hours .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 9]: ... What shall we do after lunch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 21]: `` Er -- generally -- if I 'm in the mood -- I go on writing till five o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 33]: Martin spoke with hesitation , as though fearing a reproach , and Grizel narrowed her eyes , and smiled ; a slow , enigmatical smile , but spoke not one rude word .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 13]: She had quite decided that Martin should not be in the mood !
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 13]: `` On Wednesday and Thursday I 'm to be At Home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 6]: was her next irrelevant remark .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 35]: `` We put fifteenth and sixteenth on our cards , and now that we 've stayed away a week longer than we intended , the fell date is upon us before we can breathe .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 9]: Do you suppose many people will come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 6]: Martin 's shrug was eloquent .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 25]: `` Every adult feminine creature who can crawl on two legs from a radius of five miles around , will crawl to the door .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 4]: Hundreds of 'em !
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 9]: And with luck three or four males . ''
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 18]: `` I could find it in my heart to wish it were t ` other way round !
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 2]: However !
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 14]: never say die ... There 'll be no time to finish the drawing-room !
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 13]: I 'll have to receive the surging mobs in the sitting-room upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 10]: Let 's pray the chairs will go round ! ''
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 13]: `` Could n't the drawing-room be got ready with a rush ? ''
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 12]: `` Why in the world should we bother to rush ? ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 10]: `` They 'll be disappointed if you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 8]: The drawing-room is part of the show .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 18]: The whole neighbourhood is speculating about it now , and wondering if it 's blue or pink .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 14]: A house with a closed drawing-room is like a play without the star .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 19]: Do you realise , darling , that they 'll expect to be shown all over the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 20]: `` Let them expect , if it pleases them to do it , but they _ wo n't _ !
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 9]: Let me catch anyone trying it on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 15]: cried Grizel sharply , and the gay eyes sent out a flash of fire .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 6]: `` My own little home !
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 22]: -- it shall _ not _ be turned into a peep-show for a flock of curious women to criticise and quiz .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 43]: I 'll give them tea , and I 'll give them cake , I 'll talk pretty , and put on a tea-gown which will scare 'em into fits , but show them over the house -- _ I will not _ !
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 20]: Let 's pretend the sitting-room _ is _ the drawing-room , and all will be peace and joy . ''
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 13]: `` It would leak out afterwards , and they 'd feel defrauded .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 57]: Half of them will never enter the house again , darling ; you wo n't care to pursue the acquaintance , and it will end with an exchange of calls ; but you 're rather an exceptional kind of bride , remember , and these good ladies do n't get too much amusement out of life .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 13]: It would be kind of you to give them an afternoon out !
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 38]: Not , of course , if it bothers _ you _ , but surely the maids -- '' Grizel crossed the room to the fire , and stretched a small pink , silk-quilted shoe towards the blaze .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 25]: `` If you 're going to be moral , and appeal to my better feelings , you 'd better be off to your work !
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 36]: I detest people who air their principles at breakfast ... For two straws I 'll stay in bed , and say I 'm over-tired with my journey , and ca n't see anyone at all .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 95]: I will , too , if you hector me any more , or I 'll show 'em into the dining-room , and have a sit-down tea , round the big table , with shrimps , and cold ham , and potted beef ... '' `` They 'd put it down as the latest society craze , and adopt it when they wished to be smart ... You will be one of the fashion leaders of the neighbourhood , whether you like it or not , so you 'd better take heed to your ways .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 6]: You and Lady Cassandra . ''
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 9]: Grizel 's eyes showed their most impish gleam .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 8]: I 'm building great hopes on Cassandra .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 10]: It 's dull keeping all the fun to oneself .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 18]: With her help , if she 's the right sort , I 'll make things hum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 17]: Martin told himself that it was waste of time to say any more for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 62]: Whatever he said , Grizel would contradict ; whatever he proposed , she would reject ; and as what she said would have no bearing whatever on her future conduct , the wisest plan seemed to be to kiss her several times over , talk delicious nonsense for a couple of minutes , and then to retire precipitately to his study .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 7]: The which he proceeded to do .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 22]: Left to herself , Grizel strolled into the half-furnished drawing-room and seated herself on a packing box to survey the scene .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 30]: Two rooms had been thrown into one , and the windows lowered , to allow a wide view of the garden , and so increase the feeling of space .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 18]: The furniture was a selection from the collection of antiques which she had inherited from her aunt .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 22]: Several old cabinets stood ranged along the wall ready to be put into position , and filled with treasures still unpacked .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 18]: In a corner were rolled the old Persian rugs which would be spread over the parquet floor .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 35]: At the end of five minutes ' scrutiny Grizel 's quick brain had put every article into its place , and her quick eye had seen the completed whole , and found it good .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 27]: She decided to get it finished before lunch , and give Martin a surprise , and rang the bell to summon the staff to her aid .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 6]: The parlourmaid appeared with alacrity .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 38]: It was like living in a novelette , to attend a bride who wore pink and white fineries in the morning , and looked as if she had never done a hand 's turn in her life .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 14]: She entered on the day 's duties with a refreshing feeling of excitement .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 11]: `` Please ` Um , the fish-man 's called . ''
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 3]: has he ?
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 8]: I ca n't attend to him now .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 2]: Parsons !
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 10]: -- your name is Parsons , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 15]: -- would you kindly remember that my name is not ` ` Um . '
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 14]: It is just as easy to say Madam , and sounds far better .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 29]: I want you and Marie , and cook , to come here at once , and I 'll tell you what I want done to this room . ''
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 9]: `` At -- at once , Madam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 7]: `` Certainly , at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 7]: `` Before I clear away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 10]: `` What do you want to clear away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 7]: `` The breakfast things , Madam .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 11]: And , -- and the fish-man ca n't wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 12]: `` Tell him to call again then , later on . ''
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 9]: `` He 's on his rounds , Madam .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 7]: He only calls the once . ''
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 17]: `` The fishmonger be -- '' Grizel coughed audibly , remindful of responsibilities towards the young .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 24]: It was borne in upon her that the moment which she had dreaded was upon her , and could no longer be escaped .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 31]: The fish-man was waiting , could not wait , could not return ; it therefore behoved the mistress of the household to repair to the kitchen and interview the cook .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 19]: She rose from the packing case , gathered her skirts around her , and turned to the door .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 13]: `` Kindly go and tell Mrs Mason that I am coming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 10]: Mrs Mason was on duty beside the kitchen table .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 31]: Having heard from Parsons ' lips a bated account of her lady 's splendour , she also was setting forth on the day 's duties with a flavour of excitement .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 14]: Spread out neatly in rows were the remains of last evening 's repast .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 12]: Cold fish , cold cutlets , dishevelled chicken , half-eaten sweets .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 25]: Grizel , who had never before been called upon to interview food in _ deshabille _ , turned from the sight with a shudder .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 11]: `` You can use those up in the kitchen . ''
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 9]: The cook acquiesced , and concealed her complaisance .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 11]: `` And what would you like for the room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 31]: `` In future , '' said Grizel firmly , `` I should like the menu for the day drawn out , ready to be submitted to me every morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 47]: `` I have never been uzed -- '' began the cook , then her eyes met those of her mistress , and to her own amazement she found herself concluding lamely , `` Of course if you wish it , ` Um , I must try !
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 10]: ... The fish-man is waiting for horders . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 9]: _ Au diable avec le poissonnier _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 7]: ejaculated Grizel _ sotto voce _ .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 32]: She leant back against the corner of the dresser , the tail of her white robe folded round in front , displaying the small pink shoes to cook 's appraising eyes .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 19]: Her eyes roamed here and there over the kitchen , but studiously avoided the provisions on the table .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 15]: From the region of the back door sounded a whistle , impatient and peremptory .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 42]: The cook glanced around , glanced back at the pink and white figure standing with head on one side , leisurely regarding the arrangement of brass on the mantelpiece , and was goaded into the extreme course of making a suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 6]: `` P'raps ... soles ! ''
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 6]: `` Oh , certainly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 4]: cried Grizel swiftly .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 4]: `` Soles . ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 9]: The cook ambled slowly towards the back door .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 21]: Returning a moment later , she folded her arms , and continued tentatively : `` The grocer 'll be next .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 15]: I ordered in the usuals yesterday -- but there 'll be a few extras .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 15]: -- I wanted to ask , ` Um , if you allowed lard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 18]: `` Madam , '' corrected Grizel sweetly , and pursed her lips , as though in deliberation .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 24]: To herself she was declaiming desperately : `` Now may the powers preserve me , ... one slip , and I am undid !
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 12]: What on earth does she mean by cornering me like this ?
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 10]: I must temporise , and lure her on . ''
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 18]: ... She stroked her nose , and said judicially : `` Of course -- it depends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 10]: `` Most ladies do , '' affirmed the cook .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 6]: `` If they 're particular .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 12]: It 's difficult to get it the same with dripping . ''
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 7]: Grizel had a flash of inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 30]: Lard was the superlative , dripping the positive ; naturally , then , all plain cooks angled for the former , and all British Matrons insisted on the latter .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 20]: She put on a severe air and said firmly : `` Not if your pans are perfectly clean ! ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 20]: and was so overjoyed at her own aptness , that she was ready to allow anything under the sun .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 29]: Nevertheless , the detective instinct having been born in her heart , she was resolved , as she mentally phrased it , to track lard to the death .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 14]: Cook was staring open-eyed , a faint misgiving mingled with the former complaisance .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 20]: When a mistress began talking of keeping pans clean , she was not so green as had been expected !
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 7]: Her lips set in obstinate fashion .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 16]: `` Some ladies , '' she said , `` are so fussy about the colour .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 11]: You ca n't help getting it darker with dripping . ''
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 10]: Grizel felt hopelessly that she had lost the scent .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 28]: It was a desperate position , face to face with her enemy , defenceless , yet aware that an instant 's failure must lead to wholesale debacle .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 14]: `` I ca n't tackle her alone , '' she told herself desperately .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 11]: `` I must -- I must have a confederate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 27]: and throwing principle to the winds , in a flash of thought she created a fictitious Emily , and wove around her a suitable family history .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 24]: Faithful servant , perfect cook , expert dripping-er , rent by marriage from a sorrowing mistress , now slumbering in a village grave !
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 19]: With a voice imbued with the sacredness of the remembrance , she pronounced firmly : `` Emily did !
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 9]: She _ always _ got it white . ''
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 8]: `` Oh , _ rolled _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 4]: cried the cook .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 17]: The corners of her lips gave a slight expressive twitch before she added in automatic fashion .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 14]: `` Yes , ` Um -- Madam , -- I quite understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 20]: She crossed the floor and took down a slate from its nail , while Grizel made a mental note .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 3]: `` Lard .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 6]: -- Its Use and Abuse .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 5]: -- Differentiate from dripping .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 4]: -- Why darker ?
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 11]: Under what circumstances should it be forbidden or allowed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 9]: `` Soles , '' said the cook firmly .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 5]: `` And soup ? ''
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 5]: `` Oh , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 3]: Certainly soup .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 27]: Mr Beverley likes quite a simple dinner -- soup , fish , an entree , one solid course , sweets -- lots of cream , please !
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 3]: and dessert .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 9]: See that there is always plenty of fruit .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 6]: And of course , salad .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 5]: Did I say savories ?
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 8]: Of course you 'll arrange all that .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 6]: That is all for to-day ?
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 3]: I think .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 9]: To-morrow you will have the menu ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 29]: The cook , who was a superior plain cook , reflected that she would require a `` rise , '' if they expected a party dinner every night .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 29]: If Grizel had been attired in an ordinary coat and skirt she would have rebelled forthwith , but the sheer glamour of pink and white kept her dumb .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 8]: `` Soles , '' she repeated stolidly .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 4]: `` And soup .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 7]: What kind of soup ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 5]: _ Clear _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 10]: said Grizel , and felt a glow of triumph .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 12]: Really and truly she had done better than she had expected .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 16]: So well that it seemed diplomatic to beat a retreat before she fell from grace .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 21]: She hitched her skirts still further , and stepped daintily towards the door , but cook cut short her retreat .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 8]: `` Entree , you said , Ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 5]: What kind of entree ?
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 5]: And there 's lunch .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 3]: And breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 4]: To-morrow 's breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 6]: Would it be bacon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 6]: Grizel waved an impatient hand .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 4]: `` Bacon certainly .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 5]: And er -- omelette !
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 2]: Kidneys .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 3]: Cold dishes .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 11]: The usual things one _ does _ have for breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 5]: And lunch at one .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 14]: A hot dish , please , and several cold , and some sweets .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 4]: And always fruit .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 4]: Plenty of fruit .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 10]: That will do nicely for to-day , Mrs Mason .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 9]: We 've discussed everything , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 10]: She turned a beneficent smile upon the bewildered face .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 20]: `` And I 'm sure , '' she added daringly , `` you 'll manage splendidly with dripping ! ''
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 10]: In the dining-room Parsons was still busy clearing away .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 28]: Upstairs Marie the maid was unpacking endless boxes of clothes , and hanging them up in a spare room fitted to do duty as an immense wardrobe .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 18]: At the end of a passage stood the baize door which gave entrance to Martin 's sanctum .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 13]: Grizel approached it stealthily , and pressed her lips to the keyhole .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 4]: `` Martin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 14]: A voice from within answered with would-be sternness : `` Go away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 7]: `` Martin ... I 'm sorry !
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 14]: Just _ one _ moment ... Something I _ must _ ask you .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 17]: -- Most important ... '' `` Go on , then ... What is it ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 9]: _ What -- Is -- Lard _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 13]: The door flew open , and Martin stood laughing on the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 4]: `` You goose !
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 9]: What on earth are you talking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 6]: `` That 's just it .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 10]: And how on earth am I to find out !
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 14]: I 've been interviewing cook , and she asked if I allowed it .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 28]: Do I , or do n't I , and why should I not , and for goodness ' sake _ how _ does it differ from dripping ?
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 10]: I prevaricated , and looked economical , and middle-aged .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 15]: I saw my face in the dish covers , and it aged me horribly .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 11]: I thought I 'd better find out at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 15]: `` Yes , but you must n't come running to me for such information .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 25]: I 've got to buy the lard , remember , and I sha n't be able to afford it , if I 'm interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 30]: For all you know I might have been killing my heroine ... '' `` Then she 'd have a reprieve , and I 'd have done a good deed .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 15]: You ca n't seriously have begun yet , and this is so deadly important .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 12]: You might spare five minutes to instruct your poor wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 20]: Grizel perched herself on the corner of the table , and tilted the boudoir cap at a beguiling angle .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 14]: Martin stood with his back to the fire and adopted a professorial air .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 42]: `` Lard , '' he said sententiously , `` is a substance compounded of a whitey grease , contained for the purposes of trade in balloons or bladders of skins -- '' Grizel 's face showed a network of horrified lines .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 5]: `` How exceedingly disagreeable !
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 15]: I shall certainly _ not _ allow it ... And what is dripping ? ''
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 8]: `` Dripping is , er -- brown !
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 14]: So called because it drips from the meat in the process of cooking .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 23]: It is inferior to lard , and aspires to no bladder , but lives in odd receptacles , such as jam jars .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 37]: It is supposed to supply an unconquerable temptation to a plain cook , and there are fiends in the shape of men , who are said to spend their life tempting cooks to sell the dripping .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 17]: Katrine used to see dripping in the eye of every unknown man who opened the gate .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 10]: I never heard her make any allegations about lard .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 9]: Does that distinction afford you any illumination ? ''
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 14]: Grizel sighed , and turned to the door with an air of resignation .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 9]: `` Well , good-bye , my loved one !
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 14]: Be very good to me , for you wo n't have me long .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 17]: If I 've got to order meals , I shall never be able to eat them .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 4]: I foresee that .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 11]: I never heard so much about grease in my life .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 10]: Is there nothing decent one could use instead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 3]: Martin hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 9]: `` I believe -- sometimes -- butter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 6]: Grizel waved a triumphant hand .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 4]: `` Of course !
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 2]: Butter !
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 9]: Why could n't you have said that before ?
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 7]: Nice , clean , fresh butter .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 11]: I 'll tell her I allow _ nothing _ else .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 6]: What a fuss over nothing !
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 10]: ... Martin , you 're wearing a green tie .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 11]: I 've never seen you in green before ... Darling !
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 10]: you 're adorable in green ... '' CHAPTER FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 4]: GRIZEL AT HOME .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 15]: It was the afternoon of Grizel Beverley 's first `` At Home '' celebration .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 43]: The drawing-room had been made ready for the occasion with the aid of what seemed to Martin a very army of workmen , and , as Grizel pointed out triumphantly , it looked as if it had been lived in for generations .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 13]: Not a single new object marred the mellowed perfection of the whole .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 40]: Old cabinets stood outlined against white walls , the floor was bare of the superfluity of little tables and flower-stands which characterise so many bride 's apartments ; with one striking exception the general effect was austere in tone .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 62]: The exception was found in a deep recess , on one side of the fire-place , the walls of which were hung with a gorgeous Chinese embroidery which made a feast of colour against the surrounding white and brown , and proclaimed to an understanding eye that the mistress of the house had appropriated the favoured niche for her own use .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 33]: Against the wall stood a huge old sofa , showing delicate touches of brass on the carved woodwork , and piled with a profusion of cushions to match the tapestries in tone .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 64]: There was a table also of carved Chinese wood , littered with books , and a surprising number of odds and ends considering the very short period in which it had been in use ; a bureau of dull red lacquer , littered to match , and a great blue enamel bowl containing a few , but only a few , spring flowers .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 56]: When Grizel did a thing at all she did it thoroughly , and when the drawing-room was finished to a thread , she herself dressed to match it in a cream lace robe of fallacious simplicity , caught together with a clasp of turquoise and diamonds , and a blue snood tied about her head .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 25]: When the crucial moment arrived , she intended to seat herself sultana-like on her couch and burst in full splendour upon the admiring throngs .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 44]: Martin was convinced that no living thing could fail to be subjugated by that gown , but he was equally convinced that Chumley would disapprove of the snood , which it would call a bandage , and consider theatrical and out of place .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 59]: He knew his business better than to say so , however , and was at the moment abundantly occupied in trying to lure his wife from the window , where she had taken up her position , field-glasses in hand , to watch the approach of the first group of visitors up the lane leading to the gate .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 6]: `` The Campbells are coming .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 2]: Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 2]: Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 4]: Three of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 18]: One stout person in green , one thin person in black , one girl with large feet .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 7]: Girl with feet has fair hair .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 15]: Who do you know , Martin , with fair hair and large feet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 6]: `` Dozens of 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 18]: Martin threw a quick look over his wife 's shoulder and recognised the group at a glance .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 16]: `` Mrs Mallison , wife of Major Mallison , retired Army man -- the Seaforths .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 8]: Eldest daughter Mary , dull and domestic .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 6]: Second daughter Teresa , sporting .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 10]: They are quite near the gate now , dearest .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 34]: Do n't , please , let them see ... '' Grizel put down the field-glasses , crossed to the couch , and seated herself thereon in an attitude of prunes and prisms propriety .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 14]: The bell rang , and the three ladies were shown into the room .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 28]: There was an air of diffidence , almost of shyness in their demeanour , for this was not an ordinary afternoon call , upon an ordinary bride .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 57]: This bride had been a well-known personage in society , her marriage had been a subject of almost international interest , and the fleeting glimpses which Chumley had had of her , on previous visits to Martin 's sister Katrine , had confirmed all that rumour had to say touching the puzzling variability of her nature .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 23]: It was impossible for these first callers to restrain a thrill of nervousness as to the nature of the reception before them .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 28]: When the door opened to give a momentary glimpse of a white figure sitting outlined against a background of Oriental splendour , the nervousness deepened still more .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 39]: They advanced tentatively , cautious of the polished floor , so tentatively that Grizel met them more than half-way , sailing gracefully forward with an infinity of assurance which had the unexpected result of daunting them still further .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 25]: They were requested to sit down ; they sat down , and stared ... `` So good of you to come to see me !
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 8]: You are my very first callers . ''
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 11]: `` I trust -- not _ too _ early . ''
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 8]: Mrs Mallison felt a pang of disquietude .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 9]: `` We were so anxious to meet you .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 10]: You are feeling quite settled down , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 7]: How do you like Chumley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 11]: `` Oh , thank you , _ so _ much !
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 4]: I adore everything .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 14]: You do , do n't you , when you are newly married ? ''
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 12]: Mrs Mallison and her eldest daughter looked indulgent , but shocked .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 32]: It was quite natural , quite desirable indeed that a bride should entertain such sentiments , but to express them so openly and to absolute strangers , savoured almost of indelicacy .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 35]: Teresa was occupied in taking in the details of Grizel 's costume , in condemning the blue snood , and determining to try the effect on her own hair immediately on her return home .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 31]: She found time , however , to give a quick glance at Martin as Grizel made her pronouncement , and noted the quiver of feeling which passed over his face .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 13]: The understanding which comes of fellow-feeling revealed the meaning of that quiver .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 15]: She understood why the man lowered his eyes and gave no glance of response .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 10]: He was afraid that he might reveal too much !
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 10]: After that , other visitors arrived quick and fast .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 25]: Bells rang , doors were opened , and in twos and threes the representatives of Chumley society were announced , and made their bow .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 24]: They had come together for the sake of companionships or the sake also of being able to compare notes on the way home .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 39]: They all wore their new spring costumes , and looked -- the majority at least -- personable enough , yet Martin realised with mingled pain and pride the gulf of difference which yawned between them and his wife .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 24]: They were practical , commonplace women , leading practical , commonplace lives ; to call them ill-bred or uncultivated would have been untrue .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 47]: They came of good stock , had cultivated their brains and turned them to account , but there was one side of their nature which had not been developed , and that was the side which , in Grizel 's set , had been considered all-important .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 21]: They had been brought up to discount appearances , and to view with suspicion any person of marked personal charm .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 13]: They worshipped the god of convention , and its priestess Mrs Grundy .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 38]: Grizel considered that a woman 's first duty was to charm , and her second , -- if a second remained , worth speaking about , -- to defy convention , and be a law unto oneself .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 50]: Seated in her niche of glowing colour , she looked as much out of place as an orchid in a field of wild flowers , and Martin watching the face of each new-comer , saw reflected upon it the same surprise , the same disapproval , the same unease .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 26]: He realised that Chumley was a little shocked by the unconventionality of the drawing-room , and still more by the unconventionality of the bride herself .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 70]: In the last ten years of his life he had remained supremely indifferent of what his neighbours might say or think , but -- these good women would be Grizel 's neighbours , out of love for himself she had cast her lot among them ; he was almost painfully anxious that she should have such small compensations as would result from liking , and being liked in return .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 11]: Surely among them all must be found some congenial spirit !
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 14]: `` And are you happily settled with your maids , Mrs Beverley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 31]: enquired Mrs Ritchards , wife of a City lawyer , who might almost be called retired , since he went up to town only two or three times a week .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 27]: Mrs Ritchards had two subjects of conversation -- her garden , and her servants , and had already unsuccessfully tackled the bride on the former topic .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 37]: To her relief the second venture proved a decided draw , for Grizel leant her elbows on the table , cupped her chin in her hands , and puckered her face into a network of lines .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 12]: `` Oh , yes , do let 's talk about servants !
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 5]: I 'm so interested .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 9]: I 'm making all sorts of horrible discoveries .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 7]: My cook wants to go out !
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 6]: A night out every week .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 6]: She told me so to-day .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 10]: She said she 'd always been used to it .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 18]: I said if it came to that , I 'd always been used to having my dinner .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 12]: I never knew that cooks _ expected _ to go out !
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 13]: Who is to cook one 's dinner if the cook goes out ?
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 14]: She said she was accustomed to prepare a stew , and cold shapes .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 6]: ` Cold Shapes ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 25]: Grizel 's voice dropped to a thrilling note , she lifted her chin , her outstretched fingers curved and wriggled in expressive distaste . ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 5]: _ Cold Shapes _ !
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 3]: Gruesome sound !
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 9]: It makes one think of the Morgue ! ''
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 13]: A shudder passed through the room , followed by a diffident laugh .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 34]: Teresa Mallison and a few of the younger women giggled , the elders forbore on principle to smile at such an allusion , and the Vicar 's wife entered on a forbearing explanation .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 18]: `` They are human creatures like ourselves , Mrs Beverley , and the fire is so trying !
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 14]: I encourage my cook to go out , as a matter of health .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 10]: You are not limited to shapes , of course .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 9]: There are so many nice cold sweets . ''
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 5]: Grizel shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 13]: `` Grace has not been given to me to eat cold sweets .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 7]: Not on _ those _ nights !
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 9]: I should have a carnal craving for omelettes .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 7]: We must keep two cooks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 24]: Her little nod waved aside the subject as settled and done with , and the matrons of Chumley exchanged stealthy glances of condemnation .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 10]: Mrs Ritchards , however , warmed to the attack .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 16]: `` Why not a kitchen-maid , who could make herself useful upstairs in the morning ?
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 17]: There is a young girl in my daughter 's Sunday School Class who might suit you .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 6]: Very respectable , but short .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 22]: Of course , if she were expected to wait when the housemaid is out , that might be an objection . ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 10]: She paused enquiringly , and Grizel 's face fell .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 5]: `` The parlourmaid too !
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 8]: Do they _ all _ go out ?
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 8]: Then how can one possibly be fed ?
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 21]: There will be nothing for it , Martin , but to go up to town two nights a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 32]: The suggestion would appear to have had a cheering effect , for she flashed once more into smiles , looking round the circle of watching faces with eyes a-sparkle with mischief .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 17]: `` It 's such fun trying to keep house when one knows nothing whatever about it !
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 9]: Like starting out on a voyage of adventure !
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 15]: I have the most thrilling experiences ... '' Mrs Ritchards smiled with friendly encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 15]: `` You will find it much more interesting when you _ do _ understand !
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 23]: I always say that to run a household , economically and well , is as satisfactory work as a woman need ask .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 21]: It 's like everything else , Mrs Beverley , the more you study it , the more interesting it becomes .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 24]: I have been at it for years , and I pride myself that there is very little that I do not know . ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 4]: cried Grizel deeply .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 18]: She leant her elbow on her knee and bent forward , her expression one of breathless eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 13]: `` Then you are the very person I 've been looking for !
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 20]: You can tell me something I 've been dying to know ... What is your opinion about Lard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 10]: Mrs Ritchards gasped , the other listeners gasped also .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 21]: Martin choked , turned the choke into a cough , and became suddenly engrossed in the china on the mantelpiece .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 3]: `` Lard !
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 3]: Lard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 13]: Mrs Ritchards struggled with the inevitable disability to define a well-known article .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 16]: `` But surely ... surely ... In what respect did you want my opinion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 13]: `` About allowing it , of course , and if one should .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 33]: Cook asked if I did , and it seemed such a complex question , and there was an implication about dripping -- and the colour of something , -- dark versus light .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 6]: I got hopelessly confused ! ''
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 7]: Mrs Ritchards did not allow lard .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 13]: `` It 's a question of sufficient heat , '' she maintained .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 14]: `` If they get the dripping hot enough , it does perfectly well .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 23]: It must boil till you see a blue smoke ... '' Grizel seized an ivory tablet , and made a hurried note .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 9]: `` Till you see a blue smoke ... !
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 14]: I 'll bring that in to-morrow , and confound her with my knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 5]: Thank you so much .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 7]: That 's quite a relief . ''
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 19]: She pushed aside the tablet , straightened her back and looked around with a bright , challenging glance .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 18]: The subject of lard was exhausted , and she was ready to pass on to pastures new .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 11]: `` Are you fond of games , Mrs Beverley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 27]: Teresa asked , eager to secure another member for her various clubs , and feeling that the moment was a convenient one for introducing the subject .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 22]: `` We have a good tennis club , and ladies can play golf every day but Saturday , on the Links .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 10]: It would be so nice if you would join .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 6]: We have tea every afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 12]: The members take it in turns to provide the cakes . ''
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 5]: `` How nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 6]: cried Grizel with a gush .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 5]: `` I adore cakes .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 14]: I 'll join certainly , if you 'll promise I need never play .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 10]: It bores me so to run about after balls .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 19]: I never can catch them , and I do n't want to , so why should I try ?
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 18]: Really '' -- she dropped her chin sententiously -- `` it 's a waste of time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 14]: The Vicar 's wife saw _ her _ opportunity , and grasped it .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 9]: `` I agree with you , Mrs Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 15]: The tendency of the age is to spend far too much time over games .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 10]: My husband considers that it is a national danger .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 11]: There are so many other things better worth doing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 10]: `` Oh , yes , '' cried Grizel promptly .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 6]: `` There 's bridge . ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 26]: The strain of the conversation was beginning to tell , and she told herself impatiently that she would _ not _ be `` preached . ''
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 28]: `` Bridge is so comfy ; you can sit still , and have a cushion to your back , and smoke , and talk between the deals .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 12]: It 's quite a good way of getting through the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 9]: What stakes do you play for here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 19]: The women in the company who played for money looked at the Vicar 's wife and were silent .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 12]: Those who did not , felt virtuous , and looked it .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 18]: `` At our house we make a point of playing for love , '' Mrs Ritchards announced .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 12]: `` My husband disapproves of anything in the nature of gambling .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 20]: Of course , when one has young people coming in and out , there _ is _ a responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 13]: Personally I should object very strongly to taking another person 's money .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 16]: Do n't you feel an awkwardness , Mrs Beverley -- from your own guests ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 5]: `` Not a bit .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 5]: I love it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 4]: declared Grizel naughtily .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 7]: `` But I hate to lose .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 14]: I hope someone will be wicked enough to play for money with me .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 14]: I suppose there _ are _ some wicked people in the neighbourhood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 7]: `` They do at the Court .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 6]: I go up there sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 15]: Lady Cassandra loves bridge , '' Teresa said with a pride which overcame shyness .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 20]: Was she not the only girl in Chumley who could boast of anything like intimacy with the big house ?
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 21]: She watched her hostess ' face for a brightening of interest , and felt aggrieved when it failed to appear .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 5]: `` That 's good .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 7]: I 'm glad there 's someone .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 30]: I must ask her about it , '' said Grizel nonchalantly , taking a future acquaintance for granted with a calmness which at once irritated and impressed her hearer .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 45]: At the bottom of her heart Teresa felt the birth of a jealous dread ; and found herself hoping that Cassandra would not call , would at any rate delay doing so for months to come , as was her custom with Chumley acquaintances .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 24]: And then once again the door was thrown open , and with an accent of satisfaction the parlourmaid announced -- Lady Cassandra Raynor .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 5]: She had come already !
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 26]: On the very first day on which Mrs Beverley was at home , -- as quickly , as eagerly , as the humblest among them !
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 28]: Every woman in the room felt the same sense of amaze , the same rankling remembrance of the different manner in which she herself had been treated .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 11]: Their eyes turned as on one pivot towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 30]: Cassandra entered , a vision of delight in grey velvet and chinchilla furs , her face with its delicately vivid bloom half hidden by the latest eccentricity in hats .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 56]: Her dress was very tight , her hat was very large ; from an artistic point of view the lines of both were abominable , but Cassandra considered them ravishing , and , being one of the happy people who look well despite their clothes , succeeded in mesmerising her audience into a like belief .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 17]: She advanced , walking with short , mincing footsteps , while her eyes swept the room .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 23]: Grizel rose from the sofa to greet her , and a glance was exchanged between them , a swift , appraising glance .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 71]: The lookers-on heard the exchange of a few society phrases , pronounced , it appeared to them , with an unnecessary amount of `` gush , '' but in the moment in which the two hands clasped , and the hazel eyes looked into the blue , the two women realised that for them there need be no intermediate stage ; they were not strangers , they were already friends .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 30]: Martin came forward and shook hands in his turn , and Cassandra seated herself , bending her head in a smiling greeting , intended to embrace the whole room .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 57]: She had timed her visit in the hope that most of the guests would be ready to depart , and noticed with satisfaction the empty teacups , but every woman in the room with one exception , was at that moment forming a mental resolution to stay and listen to what passed between this interesting pair .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 11]: `` Your house looks so beautifully settled , Mrs Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 11]: I hope you have n't been bored over the upset .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 13]: It 's so impossible to get things done in the country ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 5]: `` Oh , thanks .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 25]: I 'm not on speaking terms with a workman in the neighbourhood , but I _ did _ get things done as I wished !
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 4]: I always do .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 35]: We parted on the worst of terms , and I gave them a heart-to-heart talk , and told them I hoped the Germans would come soon , and drill them into something like intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 12]: It would really be an admirable thing for the country ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 9]: The Vicar 's wife arose with heavy dignity .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 19]: With a whole parish waiting on her ministrations she had no time to waste listening to such nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 5]: Unpatriotic into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 20]: Yet despite her disapproval , there was an indefinable something in the bride 's personality which touched her heart .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 39]: Perhaps it was the radiant happiness of her mien , perhaps it was that deep musical note which at times softened her voice , suggesting depths below the surface ; perhaps it was simply her fragility and charm .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 27]: Hannah Evans did not trouble to analyse her feelings , she merely held out a plump gloved hand , and smiled kindly into Grizel 's face .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 10]: `` I must be running away , Mrs Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 11]: My husband is hoping to call upon you very soon .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 9]: This afternoon he has a class for confirmation .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 9]: I must hurry home to give him tea .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 6]: He comes in so tired .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 3]: Good afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 8]: So pleased to welcome you among us !
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 8]: I hope we may often meet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 25]: Her voice rang true , there was a kindliness written on the large , plain face to which Grizel 's heart made instant response .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 30]: She brought her own left hand to join the right , clasping the grey glove with an affectionate pressure , and smiled back the while with a winsome friendliness .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 25]: There was silence in the room while the onlookers looked with critical eyes at the two figures , so typical of youth and age .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 21]: The bulky woman , with her jet bonnet and capacious black silk coat , the nymph-like form of the bride .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 7]: Every ear listened for the response .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 10]: `` Oh , you will ; indeed you will !
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 14]: I shall often be running over to the Vicarage to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 8]: `` That will be very nice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 5]: Mrs Evans smiled complacently .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 6]: `` I hope you will .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 17]: And I must not forget -- I made a note to ask you before I left .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 20]: -- It would give us great pleasure if you could see your way to take up a little work .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 8]: We are sadly in need of helpers .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 15]: I was going to ask if you would join our Mothers ' Meeting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 8]: `` Oh , give me time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 4]: cried Grizel reproachfully .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 6]: `` Give me time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 28]: In answer to after reprisals she justified herself by the assertion that she had spoken on the impulse of the moment , and in absolute good faith .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 11]: Besides , what else could the old thing have meant ?
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 15]: And even if she did n't , why need the silly creatures be shocked ?
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 34]: She did not attempt to deny that they were shocked , the flutter of dismay had indeed been so real a thing as to obtrude itself on ears , as well as eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 25]: Gasps of astonishment , of horror , of dismay , sounded to right and left ; rustling of silk ; hasty , inoperative coughs .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 27]: Grizel still saw in remembrance the petrifaction on the large kind face looking down into her own , the scarlet mounting swiftly into Teresa 's cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 18]: Only one person laughed , and that laugh had had the effect of heightening the general condemnation .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 7]: It was Cassandra Raynor who laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 7]: `` TWO OF A KIND . ''
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 15]: Mrs Evans 's departure gave the start to what was virtually a general stampede .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 28]: As one woman rose to make her adieux , another hastily joined her , offering a seat in a carriage , or companionship on the walk home .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 13]: Mrs Mallison collected her daughters with the flutter of an agitated hen .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 10]: Mrs Ritchards forgot even to refer to the kitchen-maid .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 33]: Grizel beamed upon them with her most childlike smiles , but there was no staying the flight : feebly , obstinately , as a flock of sheep each one followed her leader .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 38]: In three minutes Cassandra alone was left , and Martin having escorted the last sheep to the door , took the opportunity to escape to his study , and shut himself in with a sigh of relief .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 14]: Alone in the drawing-room the two women confronted each other in eloquent silence .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 24]: Cassandra 's eyes were dancing , her cheeks were flushed to their brightest carmine ; Grizel was pale , and a trifle perturbed .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 12]: `` Now I 've been and gone and done it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 6]: `` You have indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 3]: Cassandra laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 22]: It was delightful to be able to laugh , to feel absolutely at home , and in sympathy with another woman .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 13]: There was reproach in her words , but none in her tone .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 10]: `` How _ could you _ say it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 27]: `` Because I thought she meant it , -- honestly I did , for the first second , and I always act on the first second .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 9]: And why need the silly things be shocked ?
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 6]: They 've all got dozens .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 11]: What _ is _ the old Meeting , anyway ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 9]: `` I think it 's ... Mothers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 4]: volunteered Cassandra illuminatingly .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 4]: `` Poor ones .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 8]: They have plain sewing and coal clubs .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 3]: I subscribe .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 8]: You were invited to join the Committee .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 5]: In the parish room .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 12]: They -- I believe they cut out the plain clothes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 9]: `` Fancy me cutting out plain clothes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 13]: cried Grizel , and gave a complacent pat to her lace gown .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 21]: `` I 'll subscribe too , and stay at home , but I 'll apologise to the dear old thing .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 14]: She meant to be kind , and I 'm sorry I shocked her .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 23]: I 'm going to ring for fresh tea , and we can have a nice talk , and shock each other comfortably .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 8]: Have _ you _ any children ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 10]: `` I have a son , '' said Cassandra .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 10]: The brilliance of her smile faded as she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 15]: She was conscious of it herself and laboriously endeavoured to keep her voice unchanged .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 7]: `` He is nine years old .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 5]: At a preparatory school .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 6]: Quite a big person . ''
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 6]: Grizel also ceased to smile .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 20]: There was an expression akin to reverence in the hazel eyes as they dwelt on the other 's face .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 8]: The deep note was in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 18]: `` You look so young , just a girl , and you have a son nearly ten !
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 17]: Old enough to be a companion , -- to talk with you , and to understand .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 7]: How wonderful it must be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 53]: There was a moment of silence during which Cassandra 's thoughts flew back to those never-to-be-forgotten days when a tiny form lay elapsed to a heart overflowing with the glory of motherhood , and then reproduced before her a stocky figure in an Eton suit , with a stolid , freckled face .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 6]: She smiled with stiff lips .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 15]: `` He is a dear thing , quite clever too , which is satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 22]: You must see him in the holidays , but unless you can talk cricket I 'm afraid he may bore you .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 12]: It is not , of course , a responsive age . ''
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 5]: `` It will come !
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 4]: It will come !
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 5]: It 's storing up .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 14]: These undemonstrative natures are the richest deep down , '' Grizel said softly .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 22]: The maid came in with the tea at that moment , and she said no more , but it was enough .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 23]: Cassandra felt an amazed conviction that if she had spoken for hours , the situation could not have been more accurately understood .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 10]: Grizel poured out tea , talking easily the while .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 12]: `` Having a son must mean educating oneself all over again .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 3]: Cricket now !
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 6]: It 's the deadliest game .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 33]: One goes to Lord 's for the frocks , and to meet friends and have tea , and see all the dear little top hats waved in the air at the end .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 13]: I dote on enthusiasm ; it goes to my head like wine .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 21]: Every Eton and Harrow I wave and enthuse as wildly as if I 'd ten sons on the winning side .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 34]: But how on earth they _ can _ enjoy that everlasting running about over the same few yards , between the same old posts , hour after hour , day after day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 4]: She shrugged expressively .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 7]: I never _ look _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 11]: `` It 's worse when they talk about it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 3]: Cassandra said .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 19]: `` When my boy is at home , he and his father talk cricket steadily through every meal .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 8]: I am hopelessly out in the cold .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 18]: I suppose it will grow worse as time goes on , and more masculine tastes develop . ''
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 14]: Grizel paused , cup in hand , to stare reflectively at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 15]: `` Do you know that 's a subject which is exercising me very much !
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 25]: All my life until now I 've lived with women , and been conversationally on my own ground , and now there 's Martin !
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 28]: We 've got to have meals together , and depend on each other for conversation until death doth us part , and it 's a big proposition .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 5]: Suppose he gets bored ?
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 7]: Suppose _ I _ get bored ?
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 20]: At present it 's such delight just to be together , that it does n't matter what we say .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 72]: I could talk hats by the hour , and he would be patient , and he could prose about golf , and I 'd murmur sympathetically in the pauses , and be quite happy just watching him , and thinking what a dear he was , but '' -- she put down her cup -- `` I 'm not a child ; I _ know _ that that stage must pass !
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 25]: It may be just as sweet to be together -- it may be sweeter , but the novelty will pass ... Tell me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 10]: she bent forward , gazing in Cassandra 's face .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 8]: `` How soon does it pass ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 17]: Again Cassandra was conscious of stiffened lips , of making a pretence at the answering smile .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 15]: `` The time varies , but even in exceptional cases it is horribly soon .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 8]: I was very young when I married .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 13]: We were a big family at home , and very hard up .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 30]: It was a revolutionary change to come almost straight from the schoolroom , and an allowance of a few shillings a week , to be mistress of the Court .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 19]: I was wild with excitement , it seemed impossible that I could ever get _ blase _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 6]: `` But you did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 6]: `` Oh , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 5]: `` How soon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 8]: `` Very soon , I 'm afraid .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 4]: Incredibly soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 5]: Grizel tossed her head .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 8]: `` I am never _ blase _ .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 9]: It 's impossible that I ever could be .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 6]: Life interests me too much .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 12]: The more difficult it is , the more absorbing it becomes .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 32]: But I 'm sorry for the poor little ignorant brides who believe so implicitly in the ` happy-ever-after ' theory , that they take no trouble to make it come true .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 16]: I 'm twenty-eight , nearly twenty-nine , and I 've no illusions on the point .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 31]: My husband and I are gloriously happy , but I know we sha n't go on at the same level , unless I work hard to keep it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 3]: `` I !
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 6]: Why not _ we _ ?
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 8]: Surely it 's a mutual affair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 7]: `` Yes , but bless 'em !
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 34]: men are _ not _ adaptive , and most of them are so busy making the bread and butter , and too tired when that 's over , to bother about anything more !
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 12]: It 's the women who have to do the fitting in .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 9]: That brings us back to where we started .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 22]: I 'm trying to think ahead , and prepare myself for the horrible moment when Martin wants to talk sense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 14]: They both laughed , but Cassandra was conscious of a pricking of conscience .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 18]: It had never occurred to her to `` work hard '' to preserve her husband 's love .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 36]: Like many another woman she had taken for granted that once secured , it would automatically remain her own ; she had grieved over a divergence of interest , as a calamity beyond her control .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 11]: How could one `` prepare '' against such a contingency ?
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 18]: `` I 'm not at all sure that I agree with you , '' she said restlessly .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 28]: `` The ` happy-ever-after ' theory has its drawbacks , but it 's very sweet while it lasts , and your other seems prosaic from the start .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 18]: To have to work hard , to ` struggle ' for one 's husband 's love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 6]: `` Well , why not ?
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 19]: Is there _ any _ big thing in life which one gains , or keeps without a fight ?
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 16]: And this is the biggest of all , and the most fragile and easily lost .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 2]: Think !
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 30]: among all your friends how many could come to stay in your house for one month , that you would n't be thankful to part from at the end ?
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 16]: I do n't say you stop caring for them , but you 've had enough !
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 20]: You say to yourself : ` Emmeline is an angel , but that giggle of hers drives me daft .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 9]: Thank the gods she 's leaving to-day ! '
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 27]: or ` Emmeline 's a perfect dear , I 'm devoted to her , but _ have _ you noticed the way she wriggles her nose ?
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 21]: It 's got on my nerves to such an extent that I ca n't bear it an hour longer . '
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 45]: And you stand on the platform and wave your hand , and draw a great big sigh of relief as the train puffs away , and within the railway carriage Emmeline is sighing too , and feeling unutterably relieved to be rid of you !
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 8]: ... You know it 's true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 11]: laughed Cassandra , `` do n't talk of a month .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 7]: A week is enough for me .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 6]: Less than a week ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 10]: `` Then why wonder at the difficulties of marriage ?
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 24]: There 's no magic in a few words spoken at the altar , to make two people impervious to each other 's faults .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 34]: It 's the most wonderful and beautiful of miracles when they manage to live tied together for twenty , thirty , even fifty years , and to be decently civil until the end .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 10]: It 's worth any amount of effort to accomplish .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 28]: I adore my husband , I adore myself , but we are mortal ... we have failings ; and as we grow older they 'll grow worse .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 19]: At present we are both blind , but there will come a time when our eyes are opened .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 3]: I know .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 4]: I 've seen .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 4]: I 've watched .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 5]: I 've taken warning .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 10]: I 'm going to prepare myself in advance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 15]: `` What , _ par exemple _ , are you going to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 5]: `` Study the brute !
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 6]: Study his _ fads _ .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 24]: Join the golf club , for one thing , and learn to listen intelligently , at the cost of a few miserable afternoons .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 27]: I detest sports , and sporting clothes , and strong boots , and a red face , and tramping about mile after mile over rough ground .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 27]: If we 'd been intended to walk we should have had four legs ; but I shall very soon pick up all that is necessary ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 20]: `` Why not go a little further , while you are about it , and play with your husband ?
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 8]: You might take lessons from the pro .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 19]: to get up your game , and then you could go to the links together in the afternoons .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 16]: If you are determined to sacrifice yourself , you may as well do it thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 7]: He 'd be so pleased ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 12]: `` I 'm not so sure , '' Grizel said shrewdly .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 68]: `` I 'm his wife and he adores me , but he 'd rather play golf with a boring man with a good handicap , and come home to find me sitting on a sofa looking pretty and fluffy , ready to acclaim his exploits , and listen to volumes about every hole , and the marvellous way in which he cleeked his tee off the bogie .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 4]: what is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 9]: Do n't you call it a bogie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 22]: She laughed herself , in sympathy with the other 's merriment , and ended with an involuntary : `` Lady Cassandra !
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 9]: I 'm so _ glad _ you came .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 7]: Do let us often laugh together !
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 18]: I have such a comfortable feeling that you wo n't be shocked at anything I say . ''
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 10]: `` No one ever shocks me , except myself .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 10]: You do n't know how glad I shall be .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 16]: I 'm really rather a lonely person , though I 've lived here so long .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 17]: It seems extraordinary to have had this intimate conversation with you on our very first meeting .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 17]: I would n't dream of discussing such matters with any other woman in the neighbourhood . ''
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 5]: `` Of course not .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 9]: You do n't know anyone else so well .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 15]: We _ are _ intimates , so what 's the use of hedging ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 8]: `` I do n't want to hedge .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 9]: I 'm only too thankful to know it .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 10]: It 's not healthy to live so much alone .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 4]: One grows introspective .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 16]: These last years I 've been growing more and more absorbed in Cassandra Raynor . ''
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 10]: she _ is _ attractive , is n't she ?
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 9]: I 'm going to do exactly the same .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 13]: I felt it in my bones the moment you entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 5]: You felt it too !
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 11]: I saw the little spark leap to your eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 4]: `` It did .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 27]: It 's quite true , but I ought to warn you that being associated with me , wo n't make you any more popular in Chumley .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 8]: Chumley does n't -- approve of me !
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 17]: I expect you are sensitive enough to atmospheres to have grasped that fact for yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 4]: `` I did .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 4]: But why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 6]: `` Oh , many reasons .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 4]: I dress fashionably .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 5]: I hate parish work .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 15]: I do n't go to ` teas , ' or give them in return .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 6]: I 'm lazy about calls .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 15]: I 'm not interested in the people , and I ca n't pretend . ''
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 9]: `` Oh , but I shall be interested .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 4]: I always am .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 14]: I love all those dear old things in their dolmans and black silks .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 18]: They are types of the old-fashioned women , whom I 've read about , but never known .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 21]: I shall love studying them , and hearing their views , and shocking them by telling them mine in return .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 13]: They 'll love being shocked -- all prim old ladies love it .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 29]: They 're all walking home now , buzzing over my _ faux pas _ , and feeling as perked up as if they 'd been to the theatre .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 14]: They think they are grieved , but they have really enjoyed themselves immensely .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 21]: I lived with a very old great-aunt before my marriage , so I 'm an expert in old ladies . ''
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 4]: Cassandra assented absently .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 19]: She was not interested in old ladies , but she was interested in watching Grizel as she talked .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 17]: Her practised eye took in every detail of her appearance , and every detail was right .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 52]: She studied her features , her expression , the waves of her soft fair hair , the swiftly moving hands , and sat smiling , appearing to listen , while her thoughts raced ahead , planning future meetings , seeing herself blessed with a friend who would fill the empty gap .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 20]: `` I shall be jealous of the old ladies if you give them too much of your company ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 15]: she said , with a charming smile which accentuated the flattery of the remark .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 38]: Grizel smiled back with a little nod of acknowledgment , and Cassandra lifted her muff as if preparing to depart , asking casually the while : `` Have you good news of your sister-in-law , Miss Beverley ?
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 12]: I knew her slightly , and admired her a great deal .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 9]: She went to India , I think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 7]: Grizel 's eyes danced with animation .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 4]: `` She did .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 5]: To visit a friend .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 43]: We saw her off at Marseilles , my husband and I , and a fortnight later we were sitting in a cafe , drinking coffee , and flirting outrageously , when we suddenly saw the name of the ship on a poster !
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 21]: It had been in a collision in the Indian Ocean ; and the passengers had to take to the boats .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 18]: If another ship had not come to the rescue , they might all have been drowned . ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 6]: `` What a terrible experience !
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 19]: How sad for the poor girl , just when she was starting for such a delightful visit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 6]: `` Not at all sad .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 4]: Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 10]: A very good thing , '' said Grizel unexpectedly .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 20]: `` Katrine had been wading through trivialities all her life ; a big experience was just what she needed .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 16]: Besides -- as a matter of fact ... there was a _ Man _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 4]: `` Aha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 9]: cried Cassandra , immediately fired with feminine interest .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 6]: `` On the ship ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 3]: `` Pre-cisely !
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 21]: Fastening her into life-belts , bidding her a tragic adieu , waving a gallant hand from the sinking prow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 4]: `` Just so .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 3]: I understand !
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 9]: And when is the wedding to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 7]: Grizel 's face lengthened in dismay .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 15]: `` Goodness me -- I have n't _ told _ you , have I ?
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 11]: No one is to know for a couple of months .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 7]: How on earth did you guess ?
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 12]: _ Please _ do n't speak of it to a soul .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 51]: You see , it 's a trifle awkward , because as a matter of fact the real man , -- it was n't the real man , -- I mean it _ was _ the real man really , only he pretended -- '' Cassandra held up a protesting hand .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 10]: `` I think you 'd better leave it alone !
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 32]: You did n't tell me anything ; I guessed , but I 'll promise to forget forthwith , and be agreeably surprised when I hear the news a few months hence .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 10]: _ Do n't _ tell me any names ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 39]: Before Grizel could reply the whizz of an electric bell sounded through the house , and both women involuntarily groaned , foreseeing an end to their _ tete-a-tete _ , but the next moment Grizel 's eyes brightened .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 9]: `` It 's a _ man _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 4]: she whispered ecstatically .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 6]: `` It 's a man .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 7]: I can hear his dear boots !
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 5]: My first man caller !
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 3]: Oh joy !
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 4]: Oh rapture ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 5]: `` Captain Peignton . ''
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 13]: Dane entered , his eyes narrowed in his usual , short-sighted fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 38]: Cassandra noticed that he threw a quick glance round the room and guessed , what was indeed the truth , that he had hoped to meet Teresa Mallison , and have an opportunity of escorting her home .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 25]: When he caught sight of herself , his face showed a ripple of feeling that came and went before she could decipher its meaning .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 33]: Then he sat down , and made conversation to Grizel , and was smiled at in return with a display of dimples which seemed to have sprung into existence for his benefit .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 43]: Certainly the old ladies had not been treated to them ; even Cassandra herself had come off second best , for Grizel was essentially a man 's woman , who awoke to her highest self in the presence of the opposite sex .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 33]: It was easy to see that the present visitor was making a favourable impression , and that Grizel was alive to the charm which Cassandra had found it so difficult to define .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 24]: Looking on in silence during the first moments of conversation , Cassandra was not so sure that Peignton reciprocated his hostess 's approval .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 31]: Her light flow of conversation seemed to disconcert rather than put him at his ease , his answers came with difficulty , his eyes had none of their usual brightness .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 19]: the man who could fall in love with Teresa Mallison would hardly be likely to appreciate Grizel Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 37]: Cassandra made up her mind to take her departure , but some minutes elapsed before she really rose , and then to her surprise Peignton also made his farewells , and accompanied her to the door .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 49]: Outside , the car stood waiting , and as he helped her into it and held out his hand in farewell , his face in the fading light looked pale and tired , and Cassandra spoke on a quick impulse : `` Can I give you a lift ?
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 14]: It will be just as quick to go round by the cross roads .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 16]: Unless you prefer to walk ... '' `` Thank you , I 'd be grateful .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 8]: I 've had a heavy day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 16]: He seated himself beside her , and the car sped smoothly down the narrow road .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 17]: For some moments neither spoke , but Cassandra was conscious of a pleasurable tingling of excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 33]: She had had so many lonely drives seated in solitary state among the luxurious fitments of her Rolls Royce , that the presence of a companion was in itself an agreeable novelty .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 37]: Besides , as she reminded herself , she had a double reason in being interested in Dane Peignton , since both for Bernard 's sake and Teresa 's it was her duty to cultivate the friendship .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 14]: She turned towards him , met the brown eyes , and smiled involuntarily .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 7]: They were _ nice _ eyes !
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 9]: what do you think of the bride ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 11]: `` Just what I was going to ask you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 6]: `` I agree with Teresa .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 5]: She is adorable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 11]: The mention of Teresa aroused no flicker in his face .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 6]: His brows contracted in consideration .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 4]: `` Is she ?
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 6]: I 'm not so sure .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 14]: She does not strike me as a woman of very deep feeling . ''
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 19]: `` You would not say that , if you had heard her talking before you came in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 5]: `` Would n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 4]: That 's interesting .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 7]: What was she talking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 15]: The blood mounted into Cassandra 's cheeks , she felt a sudden unaccountable shyness .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 3]: `` Marriage !
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 13]: The relationship of husband and wives -- that sort of thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 12]: Peignton laughed : a breezy laugh without a touch of self-consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 3]: `` Naturally !
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 6]: I might have known it .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 6]: What else could you expect ?
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 34]: She is a bride , and head over heels in love , -- must have been , to give up all she did -- naturally she 'd want to prattle to another woman .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 17]: Boring for you , though , as you know so much more of the game . ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 6]: Cassandra looked at him thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 28]: The electric light overhead showed the small oval face , with the rose flush on the cheek , the soft greys of the furs round her throat .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 5]: The words came slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 21]: `` Do you know -- it 's a strange thing to confess , -- but I _ do n't _ !
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 28]: She is a bride of two months , and I 've been married ten years -- but she realises things now , that I 've passed by .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 7]: She sees deeper into the difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 10]: She feels _ more _ , not less . ''
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 24]: `` You are too modest , '' Dane said quickly , his brown eyes softening in involuntary admiration of the beautiful sad face .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 13]: `` Nothing is easier than to talk big , before the event .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 20]: We can all theorise , and lay down the law ; the tug comes when we begin to act .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 15]: Mrs Beverley is living in Utopia at present , and talks the language thereof .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 15]: Very exalted and charming , no doubt , but -- it is n't real !
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 9]: You should not take her too seriously . ''
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 5]: Cassandra did not reply .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 34]: It was not for her to betray another woman 's confidence , and for the moment she was occupied with the side-light which Peignton 's words had given her concerning his own sentiments .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 36]: -- Grizel Beverley believed in the reality of her Utopia , and intended to preserve it at the point of the sword ; Peignton proclaimed it a delusion before he had even come into possession .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 11]: Such an attitude was not natural , was not right .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 34]: He was not temperamentally a cold-blooded man , the latent strength of his nature made itself felt , despite the indifference of his pose , and Teresa was young and pretty and fresh .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 14]: Once more the older woman felt a stirring of pity for the younger .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 15]: It was as the champion of Teresa 's youth that she spoke at last .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 8]: `` You seem to have no illusions !
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 18]: Is n't it rather a pity , at your ... '' `` Stage of the game ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 10]: He finished the sentence for her with unruffled composure .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 8]: `` I think not , Lady Cassandra .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 10]: To expect too much , is to invite disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 29]: I 'm not very young , and my experience has shown me that for most people , life resolves itself into making the most of a second best .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 11]: Things _ do n't _ turn out as they expect .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 31]: They set out to gain a certain prize , and they do n't gain it , or if they do , something unexpected creeps in to rub off the bloom .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 7]: Do n't think I 'm morbid .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 11]: I 'm not ; I 've no reason to be .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 35]: There 's a lot of good , steady-going happiness open to all of us , if we are sensible enough to take it , and not lose our chance by expecting too much . ''
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 6]: `` You are very philosophical .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 28]: Generally speaking , I suppose you are right , but we were talking of marriage , when even the most matter-of-fact people are supposed to have illusions .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 39]: There are not many girls who would accept a lover who did not believe , for the time , at least , that he would be happy ever after if he could secure her as a companion . ''
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 6]: `` Oh , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 5]: he said , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 6]: `` Oh , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 35]: Cassandra was left to infer that there were occasions when exaggeration was legitimate ; occasions even when a man might succeed in blindfolding himself , but the concession did not alter the inward conviction .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 11]: Once more she relapsed into silence , considering his words .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 22]: Peignton was one of the rare people with whom it was not necessary to carry on a continuous flow of conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 35]: One could be silent , pursuing one 's own thoughts with a comfortable assurance that he was mentally keeping touch , and that when speech came it would be to pronounce a mutual decision .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 6]: `` A second best ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 13]: Those were the words which had burned themselves on Cassandra 's brain .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 17]: Life for the majority of people resolved itself into making the most of a second best .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 30]: There was plenty of good , steady-going happiness in store for those who were sensible enough to take it , and not waste their time straining after the unattainable .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 16]: The doctrine was distinctly bracing for those who had fallen into the trough of disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 14]: Cassandra made a mental note to think over its axioms at her leisure .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 61]: She had come to the stage when philosophy might have its turn , but , oh , it was good to remember that there _ had _ been a day when she had not philosophised , had not reasoned , had not made the best of anything , because youth and hope had already placed that best in her hands !
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 27]: What if it had been a delusion , -- she had had her hour , and nothing that life could bring could take away its memory !
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 22]: There stabbed through her heart a passion of pity for the man who was so calmly ignoring the glory of life .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 11]: She turned towards him , her eyes dark with earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 10]: `` Ah , no , it 's a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 15]: Why be satisfied with makeshifts , when there 's a chance of the best ?
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 23]: To be too easily satisfied is as foolish as to expect too much ; more foolish , for you miss the dream !
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 16]: If the reality fails , one can always look backward and remember the dream . ''
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 10]: Peignton 's air of absorption had no personal reference .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 16]: The words had passed over his head in so far as they applied to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 16]: He was looking at Cassandra and saying deep in his heart : `` That woman !
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 6]: To grow tired of her !
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 3]: And Raynor !
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 12]: he can never have been worthy to black her boots . ''
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 31]: Peignton had a hatred of waste , and it was waste of the worst sort to find this adorable woman thrown away on a man who was quite obtrusively unappreciative .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 15]: There was such unconscious commiseration in his glance , that Cassandra drew back sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 9]: `` Goodness , how serious we are growing !
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 13]: It 's the rarest thing in the world for me to theorise .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 10]: It must be the pernicious effect of paying calls .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 24]: I 'm not responsible for anything I say after being cooped up with rows of women discussing cooks , and Mothers ' Meetings .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 9]: Forgive me if I 've bored you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 6]: `` I 'm not bored .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 8]: I 'll think over what you say .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 11]: I expect you are right , and I 'm wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 25]: When one is obliged to slack physically , as I 've done these last years , the mind is apt to slack in sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 14]: It _ is _ a sort of slacking to be content with makeshifts .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 36]: I must brace up , and aim at the sky , or if a makeshift is inevitable , at least one can use a little deception and pretend that it is the best . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 8]: _ Could _ you do that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 13]: Cassandra 's eyes were incredulous , but Peignton smiled with easy assurance .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 7]: `` Oh , yes , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 4]: If I chose .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 7]: It 's a question of temperament .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 15]: It is always easier to me to be happy , than the other thing .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 21]: One adapts oneself -- '' The car stopped at the cross roads and Cassandra held out her hand in farewell .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 15]: The melancholy air had disappeared , an elf of mischief danced in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 9]: `` Captain Peignton , you are hopelessly prosaic .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 18]: It must be a second best after all , for the dream would be wasted upon you .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 14]: The second best , and -- shall I help you to it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 4]: `` Do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 11]: he cried , and they parted with a mutual laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 31]: It was only after the car had whizzed ahead and he was left alone upon the road , that it occurred to him to connect Teresa Mallison with the offer .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 5]: `` Poor little girl .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 4]: Too bad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 19]: he said to himself then , and there was tenderness in his eyes , tenderness in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 33]: With every conscious thought he was loyal to Teresa , yet one thing puzzled him , -- when apart from her , he found it impossible to visualise the girl 's face .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 44]: As often as he tried to summon it , it eluded him ; he could see nothing but the sweep of dark hair across a white brow , the oval of delicately flushed cheeks , a little chin nestled deep into grey furs .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 13]: And Raynor was indifferent to her , -- indifferent to that woman !
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIX .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 4]: THE EAST END .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 19]: Mrs Mallison was one of the kindest of women ; she was also one of the most exasperating .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 36]: She herself was complacently aware of the first fact , and referred to it frequently in conversation , enumerating her benefactions with obvious satisfaction : of the latter attribute she remained blandly , blindly unaware .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 17]: The combination is frequent , the havoc wrought thereby in domestic circles widespread throughout the land .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 7]: Mrs Mallison rose early from preference .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 48]: Having reached a time of life when she required little sleep , she found it a relief to rise at seven , and by an exercise of logic , unanswerable to her own judgment , considered it incumbent upon the whole household to experience a similar briskness .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 35]: She read a chapter of the Bible and the day 's portion of Daily Light before leaving her bedroom , and prayed sadly to be preserved throughout the trials and temptations of the day .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 27]: To expect happiness she would have considered a flippant attitude , unworthy a professing Christian , the glad morning face had no justification in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 5]: `` Well , Bailey !
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 14]: I wonder what trials the Lord has in store for me to-day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 45]: she would sigh meekly to the old servant who brought her early tea , and sallying forth from her bedroom , thus expectant , seldom failed to encounter several minor trials on the way downstairs : Dust ; grease ; marks on white paint .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 15]: It was usually a chastened Mrs Mallison who took her seat behind the urn .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 11]: Mrs Mallison had an active mind and a cumbersome body .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 13]: This combination is also widely known , and deplored by grown-up daughters .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 22]: No sooner had an idea entered her mind , than she wished it put into instant execution -- by a daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 38]: Whatever the daughter might be doing , however responsible might be her work , she must leave it , dismiss it from her mind , be ready with heart and will to execute her mother 's behests .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 46]: Such was a daughter 's duty ; to fail in it was to risk references to serpents ' teeth , and to that subsequent burden of remorse , to be borne by the delinquent , when death should have removed her mother to another sphere .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 46]: Mary Mallison found it simpler to give in at once , leave a letter half-written , or a photographic plate half-toned , and adjourn upstairs to move the position of jars on the storeroom shelves , or make sure that a drawer was safely locked .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 55]: She would even rise in the middle of her breakfast , and walk meekly into the drawing-room to feel if the palms needed water ; but Mary was thirty-two , and anaemic into the bargain , and her axiom in life was , `` For goodness ' sake , let us have peace ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 24]: It was easier to walk a dozen yards into the drawing-room , than to be talked at for the rest of the meal .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 20]: Mary obeyed , swallowing a constant mental revolt , the strain of which showed in her wan bloodless face .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 24]: Long ago , when she was twenty-four , she had loved a curate , and the curate had not loved her in return .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 19]: No man had ever loved her ; it was to the last degree unlikely that anyone ever would .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 24]: Mary offered automatic thanks weekly for the gift of creation , and smothered as wicked the wonder what she had been created for ?
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 14]: She also , like her mother , wondered drearily what troubles lay ahead .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 16]: Teresa was young , and pretty , and had been educated at a public school .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 31]: She had inherited from her mother a fair skin , flaxen locks , a strong will , and a pertinacity of purpose which might in time develop to disagreeable proportions .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 24]: In the meantime she was the admired youngest member of a plain and heavy family , and was by nature affectionate and appreciative .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 49]: It was only on occasions that Mrs Mallison was conscious of running up against a dead rock when she opposed her will to that of her youngest daughter ; only in glimmering rays of light that she realised that what Teresa desired , almost inevitably came to pass .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 9]: Over and over again the same thing happened .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 17]: Teresa had come forward with a proposition : consent had been withheld , Teresa had withdrawn .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 27]: Weeks , even months had passed by ; to all appearance Teresa had abandoned the proposition , and then suddenly it crystallised , it became fact .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 36]: Quietly , placidly , Teresa had bided her time , clinging with limpet-like determination to her point , moving the pawns on the board , waiting for the right moment to make the final dash .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 55]: Teresa had left the proud position of head girl in a great school to vegetate in a dull country town , dust the drawing-room , arrange flowers , make her own blouses , and `` keep up her music , '' and had found the routine as unsatisfactory as does every other modern girl .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 42]: The Mallisons were comfortably off -- that is to say , they had a small detached house , in a good-sized garden , kept two indoor maids , and a man who looked after the garden and drove the shabby dog-cart .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 23]: They were also able to pay their bills with praiseworthy regularity , and to take a yearly holiday _ en famille _ .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 32]: They likewise allowed each daughter thirty pounds a year for dress and pocket money , and would have strongly resented an insinuation that they were not acting generously in so doing .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 12]: Mary had `` managed '' on thirty for a dozen years .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 11]: Teresa managed for two , and then relinquished the struggle .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 24]: She made no moan , for moans would have had no avail , except to bring about her ears a harvest of precepts .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 19]: Teresa informed her sister that `` they must be shown , '' and she proceeded to show them .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 62]: She bought no new dress , she went about with her parents in aggressively shabby clothes , she walked incredible distances to save twopences , and thereby made herself late for meals ; in short she demonstrated to her old-fashioned parents , that if they wished to possess a pretty , creditable daughter they must be prepared to pay for her .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 16]: The allowance was increased to fifty , and Mary languished beneath a sense of injury .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 10]: Thirty had been considered enough for _ her _ !
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 23]: On the morning after Grizel Beverley 's reception the Mallison quartette was assembled at breakfast in the stiff , sunless morning room .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 29]: Mrs Mallison poured out coffee ; Major Mallison sat facing her before the silver bacon dish , the morning light streaming in on his tired , discouraged face .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 13]: Mary sat on the right , opposite the toast-rack and the egg-stand .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 12]: Teresa on the left , by the marmalade and honey jar .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 12]: The _ Morning Post _ lay neatly folded on the sideboard .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 12]: Mrs Mallison approved of sociability at meals ; conversation helped digestion .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 59]: When the Major declared that he loathed general conversation at breakfast , and would rather be left in peace than listen to the finest conversationalist alive , he was told that he was unamiable and selfish , and a burden of regret prophesied for him also `` when he had _ no _ one to talk to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 35]: Mrs Mallison poured out four cups of coffee , made her usual lament _ re _ the price of bacon , and cast a disapproving eye on Teresa 's blue _ crepe _ blouse .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 21]: `` I thought , my dear , that you were going to church this morning to decorate the chancel . ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 7]: `` I am , Mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 6]: `` In that blouse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 4]: Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 4]: `` Most unsuitable .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 3]: Too light .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 11]: A dark flannel is the right thing for the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 11]: You will have time to change it before you start .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 5]: Do n't forget ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 12]: Teresa cast down her eyes and applied herself steadily to bacon .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 13]: She had not the slightest intention of wearing a dark flannel blouse .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 27]: The blue _ crepe _ had been chosen , not for its durability , but that it might look pleasant in the eyes of Dane Peignton .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 24]: All the mothers in the world could not have made Teresa change it ; so what was the use of discussing the point !
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 9]: She gave the conversation an adroit little switch .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 10]: `` Do n't wait lunch for me , Mother .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 8]: I shall probably go to the Vicarage .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 8]: We shall need all our time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 7]: `` We are having fried steak .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 11]: If you come at all , you must be punctual .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 13]: If it 's done too long , all the strength has gone .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 11]: I could give you sandwiches to eat in the vestry .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 6]: Or it might be stewed .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 15]: If papa did not object , it could _ quite _ well be stewed .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 5]: He dislikes the onions .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 12]: If we had carrots instead , would you object , papa ?
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 10]: But , of course , there 's the flavour .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 15]: Carrots are _ not _ so seasoning ... Perhaps it had better be sandwiches .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 13]: Mary , is there a glass of that chicken and ham paste ?
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 9]: See if there 's a glass , dear .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 9]: Cook could make some nice fresh sandwiches . ''
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 13]: Mary moved automatically , but Teresa stopped her with a waving hand .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 5]: `` I loathe sandwiches .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 10]: I shall go somewhere and have a proper lunch .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 7]: Do n't bother , Mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 16]: `` My dear , '' said Mrs Mallison reproachfully , `` I am your mother .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 18]: When you have a tiring day before you I am naturally anxious that you should be fed .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 8]: They will be busy at the Vicarage .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 5]: Cold meat and salad .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 15]: One could hardly expect more , but you are accustomed to a hot dish .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 17]: It is the day for steak , but if papa did n't object we might change .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 20]: I do n't care for changes as a rule , it upsets the servants , but just for once .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 5]: -- A chicken now !
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 4]: You like chicken .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 16]: Just run to the telephone , dear , and tell Bates to send one up .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 4]: Good , roasting .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 4]: Three and six .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 7]: If papa does n't mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 12]: Not a flicker of expression passed over the Major 's face .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 31]: He was the Jorkins of the establishment , and knew well that , useful as he might be for purposes of quotation , he was negligible as a working factor .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 8]: He continued resignedly to partake of bacon .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 6]: Teresa vouchsafed an appreciative smile .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 8]: `` We 'll have fowl for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 8]: Plenty of time when the boy calls .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 9]: I 'm going out to lunch , Mother .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 4]: I 'd rather .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 8]: It 's part of the fun . ''
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 4]: Mrs Mallison sighed .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 8]: Here was one of the expected trials .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 41]: A daughter , unappreciative , preferring to roam abroad , oblivious of the fact that after a morning 's church decorating she would be in possession of a harvest of small talk which a mother would naturally desire to hear .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 16]: Who decorated the lectern ; who the finials ; who did the windows this year ?
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 8]: The windows were the least coveted post .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 27]: A mother whose daughter had been honoured with the east end would naturally feel agreeable sympathy for the mother of those who wrestled modestly with window-sills .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 7]: Then also there were subsidiary interests .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 7]: Who brought the Squire 's flowers ?
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 6]: Did Lady Cassandra drive down ?
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 7]: Was the Vicar tiresome about nails ?
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 13]: Exactly what did everyone present say about Teresa 's scheme of colour ?
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 23]: The good lady felt it hard that she should have to wait until evening to satisfy her interest on these thrilling points .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 13]: She set her lips and said to herself , `` Certainly not !
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 17]: If young people have no consideration for others , they can not expect to be indulged .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 5]: _ Not _ fowl .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 7]: Roast end of the neck . ''
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 15]: At the side of the table Mary sighed , and stared dejectedly into space .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 45]: Eight years ago _ she _ had been asked to `` do '' the east end , and the curate had been by her side all day helping her , reaching to high places , bending down , taking the vases from her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 18]: After all these years she could still see before her every line of the smooth boyish face .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 54]: He had never loved her , he had gone away and married another girl , but he had been admiring and attentive ; several times in the course of that day he had made her sit down to rest ; at tea at the Vicarage he had placed a cushion behind her back .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 14]: In Mary 's starved life such small incidents took the place of romance .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 19]: She looked across the table at her sister , not so much with envy , as with pity .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 3]: Poor Trissie !
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 10]: she also was dreaming ; she also must awake .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 11]: And Teresa understood the glance and set her red lips .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 16]: She had not the least intention in the world of following in Mary 's footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 12]: Thirty-two should never find _ her _ dragging along at home !
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 18]: She thought of Dane Peignton with the warm glow at the heart which always accompanied the thought .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 52]: If Dane did not `` care , '' her dearest hope would be blasted , but it was characteristic of Teresa that she could put aside the possibility , and be assured that even Dane himself could not spoil her life , or reduce her to Mary 's apathy of indifference .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 54]: After breakfast came `` Worship , '' when the maids came in and sat on two chairs placed as near as possible to the door , and the mistress of the house read aloud a chapter in the Bible , followed by a long prayer from a book entitled _ Family Devotions _ .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 21]: The chapter this morning was taken from Judges , and had little obvious bearing on the lives of the hearers .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 12]: It is doubtful if anyone attended after the first few verses .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 10]: The cook was listening for the tradesmen 's bell .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 21]: If it rang in the middle of Worship it was understood that she was to rise softly and creep out .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 18]: Under such circumstances it was , as she expressed it , difficult to `` settle down . ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 9]: The housemaid was thinking of her young man .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 8]: Teresa was considering her scheme of decoration .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 10]: Major Mallison and Mary were resignedly sitting it out .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 16]: For the prayer everyone rose and knelt down , but the mental attitude remained unchanged .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 9]: They rose once more with sighs of relief .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 50]: After breakfast Teresa dusted the drawing-room , made her own bed , and hung over the banisters listening for the moment when her mother should begin telephoning orders to the tradespeople , when she herself might leave the house without fear of further questioning as to the blue blouse .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 52]: She expanded her shoulders with a sigh of relief on reaching the open air , and sped along the quiet road with the feeling of escape which every member of the Mallison household experienced when the gate was safely closed , before a shrill recall had sounded from door or window .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 28]: Teresa 's thoughts that morning were occupied as many another daughter 's have been before her , in pondering the astonishing problem of her parents ' youth .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 6]: Father and Mother in love !
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 6]: Father ardent , Mother shy !
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 14]: Father and Mother exchanging love glances ; engrossed in one another 's society .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 5]: Could such things be ?
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 7]: And if so -- lacerating thought !
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 8]: -- _ could they be again _ ?
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 14]: In thirty years ' time could Teresa and Dane ... Teresa flushed violently .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 8]: She had not prayed at Family Worship .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 53]: She had been frankly and emphatically bored , but she prayed now , walking along the public road , in her blue coat and fashionable jam-pot hat , she lifted her eyes to the grey skies , and the voice in her heart cried earnestly : `` I 'll make him happy !
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 7]: Help me to keep him happy !
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 13]: Give him to me , and make me a good wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 10]: A glow of tenderness softened the hard young eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 18]: `` Make me good , '' cried Teresa , '' _ For Dane 's sake _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 17]: She was the first to arrive at the church , before even the Vicar 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 20]: Was she not the honoured young worker , to whom had been entrusted the decoration of the east end ?
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 17]: A mass of daffodils , wallflowers , and primroses lay banked in baskets along the aisles .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 20]: These were the contributions of the poorer members of the community , the villagers and owners of small gardens .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 35]: Outside the chancel rails were ranged rows of growing bulbs in pots , hyacinths , narcissus , the finer variety of daffodils , great trumpet-like heads of white and cream , orange and gold .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 26]: These were the first contribution from the Court ; later on the carriage would bring down a hamper of flowers , freshly cut and fragrant .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 26]: The sexton came forward with a box containing the tin vases and fitments provided for such occasions , and delivered the usual warning about nails .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 7]: The Vicar would allow no nails .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 31]: Teresa took off her long coat and placed it in a pew ; the blue of her blouse seemed to take an added richness from the austerity of the surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 15]: How glad she was that she had disobeyed her mother and kept it on !
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 15]: Presently the Vicarage party arrived , and quickly following one after another the helpers .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 41]: Teresa lifted the flower-pots one by one and placed them behind the delicate tracery of the oak screen , so that the pots themselves were hidden and the carved openings appeared to give a vista into a sweet spring garden .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 16]: All the while she worked , she kept a strained outlook for Dane 's appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 50]: When another helper approached , and would have loitered in conversation , she made a speedy excuse for hurrying away , lest he should come now , and their meeting be marred ; when her back was turned to the aisle she listened for the sound of his footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 27]: At any moment he might enter , stand by her side , call to her in his full , rich tones : `` Miss Teresa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 13]: Eleven o'clock came , and he had not appeared ; half-past eleven .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 6]: All the pots were arranged .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 20]: Intentionally Teresa had lingered over the work , dreading to begin the more elaborate decorations which would require aid .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 37]: If she were seen mounting a stool , some of the men helpers would at once come forward to assist ; and Dane entering and seeing her thus provided , might attach himself to someone else .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 10]: A dull ache of disappointment filled Teresa 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 25]: If he really cared ; if the opportunity meant to him what it did to herself , he would not have wasted the hours .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 26]: She put her last pot in its place , stood back to view the effect , and heard at last the longed-for words of welcome .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 15]: `` Miss Teresa -- here I am ; bright and early , you see !
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 10]: What have you got for me to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 10]: He was smiling , composed , unconscious of offence .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 28]: The ache sharpened into pain at the realisation , but Teresa had a wisdom beyond her years , and allowed no sign of disappointment to become visible .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 16]: To sulk and looked aggrieved was not the way to increase a man 's admiration .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 15]: She smiled into his eyes , and cried readily : `` Heaps of things !
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 9]: I need you for all the stretchy places .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 5]: You are so big .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 13]: And those great palms ... They have to go into the corners .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 9]: Will you help me to move them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 4]: `` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 6]: I 'll do it myself .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 9]: Just point out where they are to go .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 15]: What 's the good of me if I ca n't save you fatigue ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 40]: The tenderness of his smile was as ointment of healing , but true to her principles Teresa averted her eyes , and put on her most business-like manner , so that no answering sign of tenderness might be visible .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 22]: Not to the verger himself had her manner been more cool and detached , but Dane showed no sign of dissatisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 46]: They had met to work , not to make love ; he admired the girl for her brisk , capable ways , and found pleasure in the sight of her alert young figure clad in the short skirt , stout boots , and untrimmed hat .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 25]: They worked industriously for the next half-hour , banking up comers of palms , covering the foremost pots with a velvety cushion of moss .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 21]: Side by side they knelt on the marble floor , pulling apart the fragrant sods , patting them into shape .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 35]: Once when a rebellious morsel refused to remain in place Teresa fumbled among her yellow locks for a hairpin to act as skewer , whereupon Dane made a quick movement to withdraw her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 11]: `` No , no , it 's covered with soil !
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 5]: ... Let me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 22]: He covered his finger and thumb with a handkerchief , carefully extracted the nearest pin , and held it towards her .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 5]: `` That 's better !
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 10]: It 's too bad to soil your pretty hair .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 11]: You 've got loads of hair , have n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 10]: I love to see a girl with good hair .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 8]: How far does it come down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 6]: `` Past my waist . ''
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 31]: Teresa 's conscience pricked her on account of one braid which could come down as far as required , but there seemed no immediate need for confession on that score .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 20]: Her cheeks were flushed , she took a long time over the last arrangement of moss , pondering uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 6]: Had anyone _ seen _ ?
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 5]: What would they think ?
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 13]: She hoped to goodness that Miss Mason 's eyes had been averted !
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 34]: What Miss Mason saw at noon , was parish news by sunfall ... `` By the by , you 'll be interested to hear that Teresa Mallison is engaged to that young Peignton .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 11]: I saw him _ distinctly _ stroking her hair . ''
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 15]: In imagination she could hear the thin , clipped voice scattering the news broadcast .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 23]: And in time it would come to Dane 's own ears ... Teresa rose and cast a searching glance round the church .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 12]: No one was looking , the workers were engrossed and preoccupied .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 32]: The Vicar 's wife was affixing a cross of daffodils to the front of the pulpit , the doctor 's daughters were trimming the lectern with stiff little bunches of daffodils .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 27]: All down the aisle workers were twisting sprays of ivy round the tall gas standards , in the discreet background dowdy nobodies were wrestling with window-sills .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 44]: The Vicar 's wife held firmly to the theory of universal brotherhood , but it would never have occurred to her to ask a wealthy parishioner to `` do '' the windows , or a tradesman 's wife to undertake the east end .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 16]: Teresa and Dane left the chancel and stood hesitating at the head of the aisle .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 17]: Now they were ready for the cut flowers , and the cut flowers had not arrived .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 8]: `` The Squire promised to send down .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 9]: I wrote again last night to remind him .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 9]: He _ ca n't _ have forgotten . ''
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 5]: `` Oh , no .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 6]: They 'll be here soon .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 10]: There 's a car at the door now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 42]: Peignton peered forward , looking down the length of the aisle into the sunlit churchyard beyond , and the girl watching him , as she loved to do at unobserved moments , saw a sudden light come into the lazy eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 62]: She peered in her turn , and beheld a small grey foot emerge from the door of the car , then a second foot , and finally a tall figure , grey-robed , grey-furred , which stood aside , sharply outlined against the darkness of the background , and waited for the descent of still another figure , coated in white .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 3]: Lady Cassandra !
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 13]: ... she had come herself , and with her Mrs Martin Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 21]: They were driving about together in the morning , a sign of intimacy more eloquent than a dozen afternoon meetings .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 24]: They were smiling into each other 's faces as they walked up the church path , talking with the ease of lifelong friends .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 38]: Teresa felt a pang of jealousy , not of Dane Peignton , -- these women were married and could have no interest for him , -- but for herself , and her position in the Raynor household .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 35]: Proud as she had been of the degree of intimacy to which she had been admitted , in her heart she had acknowledged the presence of a barrier shutting her out from personal friendship .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 25]: She had been a favoured acquaintance , nothing more , and now a friend had appeared , and the acquaintance must needs stand aside .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 47]: Up the church aisle came the two women , side by side , graver now as befitted their surroundings , yet bringing with them a whiff of the world of gaiety and fashion , the influence of which spread subtly over the feminine body of workers .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 48]: The Vicar 's wife pulled down her cuffs , and brushed the leaves from her gown ; the doctor 's daughters arranged stray locks , and placed themselves in artistic attitudes around the desk , and from the background poor Miss Bruce looked on with widened eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 17]: Cassandra came forward to shake hands with Mrs Evans , the natural hostess of the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 7]: `` Good morning , Mrs Evans .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 6]: How busy you all are !
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 14]: I drove down with the flowers , and brought Mrs Beverley with me .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 7]: The groom is bringing them in .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 27]: We promised Miss Mallison -- '' She looked around , caught sight of Teresa and Peignton standing side by side , and nodded , faintly smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 6]: The affair was progressing then !
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 6]: No need for outside help .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 27]: Teresa , flushed and happy , the blue of her blouse setting off the pink and white of her complexion , looked her most attractive self .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 48]: Cassandra envied her , pitied her , felt an inexplicable irritation with her , all at the same moment , but being bred in the school which considers the suppression of feeling to be the first axiom of good manners , her smile of greeting remained unchanged .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 23]: The vases for the altar had been carried into a vestry , where they stood on a table ready to be filled .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 27]: The groom was directed where to carry his hamper , and the two visitors followed , talking in undertones to Teresa and Dane as they went .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 20]: Inside the room itself there was a greater sense of freedom , and their voices instantly heightened in tone .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 34]: They had an air of having nothing to do , and of being indifferent as to how long they stayed , which was far from welcome to one at least of the workers .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 31]: Teresa had planned exactly how the vases were to be arranged , and had anticipated a happy half-hour , alone with Dane , free from the observation of curious eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 16]: She was capable of carrying out her own ideas , and wished for no assistance .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 15]: It was Peignton who made the unwelcome suggestion that Cassandra should remain to help .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 8]: `` I 'm out of this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 5]: he said , shrugging .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 16]: `` Never arranged flowers in my life , and do n't know how to begin .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 22]: Dragging about palms is more in my line , but that 's done now , and I 'm no more use .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 11]: Sorry to be such a broken reed , Miss Teresa !
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 28]: Perhaps Lady Cassandra -- '' He looked at Cassandra , and once again his eyes lightened , as if what they beheld was good in his sight .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 12]: `` I am sure you know how to arrange flowers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 19]: `` Oh , yes , '' Cassandra said calmly , `` I 'm supposed to be quite good .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 10]: Well , Teresa , I am at your service .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 5]: You are in command .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 4]: Issue your instructions !
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 13]: Mrs Beverley , you wo n't mind waiting a short time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 10]: `` Oh , no , '' Grizel said sweetly .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 7]: `` I 'll help too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 30]: She made no motion to take off her gloves , however , but stood watching with a lazy smile while her companion threw off her furs in business-like fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 24]: The square emerald sparkled against the whiteness of her hand , as she turned over flowers , searching for the most perfect specimens .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 31]: Once more Dane watched it with fascinated attention , once more looked from it to Teresa 's hands , reddened and stained with soil , and hastily averted his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 6]: Henceforth he kept them averted .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 10]: There was no disloyalty in admiring a beautiful thing .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 10]: The wrong began when one stooped to invidious comparisons .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 20]: By degrees it came about that Cassandra arranged , while the others stood by , and supplied her wants .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 27]: She was accustomed to the handling of delicate blooms , and possessed little coaxing tricks of propping and supporting , which added greatly to their effect .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 26]: Of the first two vases completed , hers was so palpably superior , that the obvious course was to invite her to undertake all five .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 24]: Teresa gave the invitation with a good grace , and stood aside handing sprays of lilies , and disentangling delicate fronds of green .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 23]: As she stood she faced a small mirror on the wall , before which the Rev. Vicar presumably concluded his clerical toilet .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 23]: At the moment it gave back the reflection of herself and Cassandra , standing side by side , and the contrast stung .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 39]: At home , by the same law of contrast , Teresa complacently considered herself next door to a beauty , but seen side by side with Cassandra Raynor , her image appeared of a sudden coarsened and blunted .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 40]: Moreover , the inferiority was not confined to the body ; mentally as well as physically she was at a disadvantage ; -- her words seemed halting and difficult , compared with the other 's delicate ripple of conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 12]: Teresa 's honesty accepted the fact , disagreeable though it was .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 34]: The little ache at her heart was not caused so much by jealousy , as by regret for the hour which she had longed for , the hour which was not to be .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 12]: Surreptitiously she watched Peignton to see if he shared her disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 12]: His manner was quieter than when they had been alone together .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 22]: He looked less at his ease , but he was interested , his eyes followed the delicate work with absorbed attention .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 9]: He was more interested , rather than less .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 6]: Teresa felt suddenly very tired .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 8]: She had hoped he would look disappointed !
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 19]: Meanwhile Grizel had strolled out of the vestry and stood viewing the scene with lazy , smiling eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 22]: The workers were so busy that they had not noticed her approach , and she had time to study them unawares .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 31]: For the most part they worked in pairs , consulting together , the more deft-handed arranging the flowers , the less skilful acting as assistant , and executing her commands .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 37]: Quietly though they worked , there was in the air a sense of _ camaraderie _ ; and one divined that these workers were friends who had chosen to work together , and enjoyed the companionship .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 43]: In the background a solitary black-robed figure stood straining upward from the seat of a pew , engaged in covering the sill of a window with fragments of foliage , and those inferior flowers which had been rejected for more prominent places .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 16]: Grizel took a short cut through a pew , and approached this worker 's side .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 7]: `` May I help you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 14]: she asked , and Miss Bruce turned her head and stared in bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 29]: She was a middle-aged spinster , who lived in a small villa , with a small servant-girl , a fox-terrier , and a canary in a brass cage .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 14]: She possessed exactly two hundred pounds a year , and felt herself rich .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 52]: It was only in the matter of friends that she was poor , for the taint of trade set her apart from the people whom she wished to know , while as a lady of independent means she , in her turn , despised the class from which she had sprung .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 29]: Mrs Evans considered Miss Bruce a `` useful '' worker , and asked her to tea regularly once a year , in addition to a summer garden party .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 13]: The churchwarden 's wife was asked to meet her on these occasions .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 19]: `` You wo n't mind , dear , I know , '' the Vicar 's wife would premise .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 19]: `` You _ are _ so kind , and it gives her such pleasure , poor soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 17]: But as a matter of fact the tea party gave Miss Bruce no pleasure at all .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 44]: She was keen enough to realise the exact conditions of her invitation , and instead of feeling flattered was wounded and aggrieved ... `` Last week she had nine people there one afternoon , the Mallisons and the Escourts , all that set .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 8]: Ellen heard about it from the cook .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 9]: Why could n't she ask me then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 6]: she would ask herself bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 8]: `` Never anyone but Mrs Rose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 21]: Every year she decided to refuse the next invitation , but when it came to the time her courage failed .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 17]: In the deadly dullness of her life a change was too rare to be lightly foregone .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 23]: She stepped down from her high perch now , and turned her dull eyes to stare into Grizel Beverley 's happy face .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 9]: `` May I help you a little ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 9]: It 's very kind , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 8]: I shall be much obliged . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 8]: _ That 's _ all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 34]: said Grizel cordially , and promptly seated herself at the end of a pew , and extended an arm along the top of the oaken back , in an attitude of luxurious ease .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 75]: Exactly what form the `` help '' was to take it was difficult to guess , but Miss Bruce was not thinking of such mundane considerations ; her mind was occupied in grasping the astounding fact that the latest celebrity of the countryside , Mrs Martin Beverley , late Miss Grizel Dundas , had chosen to single out her insignificant self , when some of the most important ladies in the parish were present .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 15]: `` It 's -- not very interesting over here , '' she stammered apologetically .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 6]: `` Window-sills are so dull .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 9]: It 's impossible to get an effect . ''
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 13]: `` They _ are _ rather muddly , are n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 24]: Grizel agreed cheerfully , casting a roving eye over the branches of greenery , scattered intermittently with daffodils which had had their day .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 21]: `` But I daresay no one will look ... I do n't think I know your name , do I ?
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 9]: You have n't called on me yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 7]: Miss Bruce flushed a deep brick-red .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 10]: Her lips tightened in remembrance of the old grudge .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 8]: `` I -- do n't call ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 4]: she said bluntly .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 8]: `` It would not be -- acceptable .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 5]: I am poor . ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 7]: `` Oh , so am I !
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 5]: There we can sympathise .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 8]: Is n't it _ dull _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 4]: cried Grizel gaily .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 9]: Miss Bruce looked at her in silent disclaimer .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 29]: No one could look into Grizel 's face and doubt the honesty of her words , but Miss Bruce reflected tartly that there were different degrees of poverty !
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 24]: Why , the clothes on the bride 's back this morning must have cost a considerable portion of her own year 's income !
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 65]: The white coat hung in strange and wonderful folds , the outside was severely plain , just a simple , unadorned cloth garment which an ordinary woman might have worn ; but as she sat , the fronts had fallen apart , and the spinster gazed with awe upon a gorgeousness of lining such as it had not entered into her brain to conceive .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 24]: Ivory brocade , shot through with gold ; a band of exquisite embroidery where the two fabrics met , cascades of delicate lace .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 12]: Miss Bruce was fond of coining phrases to express her meaning .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 10]: She coined one now , `` Muffled magnificence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 30]: It seemed an inconceivable thing that any woman could allow such richness to be hidden away beneath a cloth exterior , yet something latent within her applauded the feat .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 20]: `` Muffled magnificence , '' she repeated to herself , her gloating eyes taking in each perfection of detail .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 31]: Her lips twisted in grim realisation of the difference in degrees of poverty , but a quality of sincerity and kindliness in Grizel 's hazel eyes prompted an unwonted confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 19]: She heard herself saying quite simply and naturally : `` There is something besides poverty , Mrs Beverley !
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 6]: My father was a plumber .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 18]: Quite in a big way , of course , but still , -- he was in trade .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 19]: He was a very good father ; he educated me well and left me enough to live on .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 25]: I 'm grateful to him , but , -- you can understand -- '' Grizel gave a soft little _ move _ of appreciation .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 7]: `` A _ good _ plumber .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 15]: -- A plumber with principles ... Oh , you _ must _ be proud !
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 18]: I 've travelled all over the world , but I never heard of such a thing before .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 52]: All the other plumbers I 've heard of have brought misery on everyone who knew them ... You must certainly come to see me , and tell me all about him , and I 'll call on you too , and see his photograph ... Had he a chin beard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 10]: Miss Bruce 's gratification was merged in stunned surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 6]: `` Chin -- beard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 5]: `` They always have .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 5]: Have n't you noticed ?
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 13]: If your father had n't , that makes him more wonderful still .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 12]: And where is your house , Miss -- '' `` Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 4]: In Rose Lane .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 6]: Near the Men 's Institute .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 8]: A little house with a green porch .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 32]: You would n't have noticed -- '' `` I 've just come , you see , '' Grizel apologised , `` and I 've been busy about my own little house .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 14]: I 'll show it to you , and you must show me yours .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 8]: When will you come to tea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 46]: Miss Bruce stood silent , struggling between a longing to name a date , clinch the invitation , and wave a flag of triumph in the eyes of her enemies , and some softer feeling which forebade taking advantage of the ignorance of a new-comer .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 31]: She looked down at the young happy face , at the slim young body in its dainty trappings , and a rare impulse of tenderness stirred in her dried heart .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 37]: People said that Mrs Beverley had been born to a great fortune , had lived in luxury among the highest in the land , but she gave herself fewer airs than many upstarts in semi-detached villas .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 6]: One good turn deserved another .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 9]: Miss Bruce rose to unexampled heights of sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 18]: `` It is very kind of you -- I appreciate it , but I 'd better not !
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 12]: The gentlefolk do n't know me , do n't want to .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 17]: If they met me sitting in your drawing-room it would be awkward for everybody concerned . ''
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 5]: Grizel elevated expressive eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 7]: `` I choose my own friends .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 8]: No one has a right to dictate .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 20]: I 'll drive over for you some day , and carry you off whether you want to or not .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 7]: You could help me so much !
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 53]: There are thousands of things I want to know about the place , and the workpeople , and where to send , and what to do when things happen -- they always _ are _ happening in a house , and I 've a sort of conviction that you could tell me !
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 13]: I 'm rather a lazy person , but I get things done .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 14]: Providence is kind in sending along people to do them for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 34]: Such was the magnetism of the dimpling smile that Miss Bruce entirely forgot that this was the person who in the present instance had volunteered to help herself , and stammered ardent promises .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 5]: Anything she could do !
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 5]: Everything she could do .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 16]: Only too pleased and proud -- '' _ That 's _ all right , then .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 5]: And about those daffodils !
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 16]: _ Do n't _ you think they 'd look better massed together into little groups ?
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 14]: They do look so plaintive fading away all on their own little lones .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 10]: You 'd get more effect from good-sized bunches ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 8]: `` Well , I can try ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 35]: Miss Bruce conceded amiably , and for the next ten minutes she worked diligently , carrying out the instructions given by a soft voice , and a waving hand in an exquisitely fitting glove .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 21]: The result was distinctly to the good , and Grizel had no hesitation in taking her due share of praise .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 10]: `` We _ have _ done them well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 12]: she said graciously at parting , and Miss Bruce magnanimously agreed .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 10]: `` Thank you so much for your help ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 30]: Grizel made another short cut through a pew , and was intercepted by the Vicar 's wife , who had been watching the _ tete-a-tete _ with wondering eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 9]: Mrs Martin Beverley , and poor Miss Bruce !
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 13]: What on earth had they found to talk about all that time ?
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 36]: Her keen eyes were alight with curiosity , but Grizel vouchsafed no information ; she knew without hearing what the good lady would have to say , and was in no mind to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 22]: Perhaps of all sins , pride is the most universal , and the most varied in the manner of its presentment .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 16]: It hides itself under many disguises , obtrudes its head in the most unexpected situations .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 94]: The socialist railing at society , and calling upon mankind to follow his example , is often more inflated with pride than the aristocrats against whom he inveighs : an ardent philanthropist living happily among East End roughs , will display unexpected bristles to a fellow-worker who has not known the advantages of a public school ; so Grizel Beverley , looking down on the small folk of Chumley from the altitude of her past experiences , failed to grasp Infinitesimal distinctions , and saw no reason why she should be hindered thereby .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 13]: She had no mind to obey instructions from the Vicar 's wife !
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 33]: She floated past with a nod and a smile , and joined the little group of three who were standing outside the Cancel rails , surveying the effect of the completed vases .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 24]: The girl Teresa looked paler and more set in expression ; tired , no doubt , with her morning 's _ work _ .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 30]: Cassandra , on the contrary , looked refreshed , the interest of having work to do , and doing it well , lighting her eyes into a girlish brightness .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 18]: Her face was almost as happy as Grizel 's own , as she turned to greet her .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 5]: `` Here you are !
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 10]: I hope I 've not kept you too long .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 9]: It must be nearly time for lunch . ''
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 43]: She cast a quick glance at the two by her side , and added tentatively ; `` I 'm going straight back in the car ; wo n't you both come , too , and let me feed you after your labours ?
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 2]: Do !
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 7]: I 'd be so pleased . ''
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 10]: Without a flicker of hesitation came Teresa 's refusal .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 9]: `` Thank you ; I could n't possibly .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 5]: I 've not finished .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 10]: There is always a cold lunch at the Vicarage .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 9]: Mrs Evans asks anyone who likes to go .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 6]: It 's so near . ''
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 7]: `` Yes , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 47]: Cassandra held out her hand in placid acceptance of the fact , spoke a few words of farewell , and turned to Peignton , taking for granted a like excuse on his part , but he was hesitating , and displaying an obvious wish to accept .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 16]: `` Is there anything more that I can do to help you , Miss Teresa ?
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 16]: -- If my work is finished , there 's no need for me to stay .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 18]: Of course , if there 's anything I can do -- '' `` No , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 7]: Only a few odds and ends .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 3]: Nothing serious .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 11]: I can manage quite well , '' said Teresa staunchly .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 13]: Her heart was cramped with pain , but she made no sign .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 34]: As calmly as a martyr of old , she smiled through the fire , shook hands with each of the three in turn , and accompanied them a few steps down the aisle .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 10]: Cassandra walked ahead , her head in the air .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 9]: `` Now why did he do that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 5]: she asked herself uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 6]: `` I asked them together .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 8]: I never dreamed he would come alone .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 15]: Perhaps Bernard was mistaken , and there 's nothing between them , after all .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 6]: She seemed absolutely detached ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 19]: The possibility brought with it a sense of relief , and her thoughts flew ahead to the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 16]: `` I 'll take him to my summer-house to tea , and we can talk .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 38]: There are quite a number of things I want to say ... '' It was five o'clock before Teresa Mallison returned home that afternoon , for the `` few odd things '' stretched out to unexpected length .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 29]: The day had turned out very differently from what she expected , but there was no anger in her heart against the two who had disturbed her peace .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 15]: With unusual fairness of mind she realised their unconsciousness , their unwillingness to offend .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 5]: Things had just happened .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 6]: No one was to blame .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 40]: This philosophic attitude did not prevent her from being exceedingly short and snappy with her family for the rest of the evening , or from refusing coldly to partake of the fowl which had been provided for her delectation .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 24]: To some natures a scapegoat is necessary , and in nine cases out of ten they are conveniently discovered in the home circle .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 3]: STOLEN HOURS .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 29]: Driving home in the car Cassandra was conscious of contending emotions which carried her back to nursery days ; pleasure , excitement , an underlying gnawing of guilt .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 35]: So had she felt , stealthily playing in a corner with a toy purloined from a sister 's store , and yet , as she assured herself , there was no need for compunction .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 32]: She had invited both Teresa and Dane ; it was not her fault if the girl chose to refuse ; not her fault if the man was ungallant enough to accept .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 7]: Yet the feeling of guilt persisted .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 24]: She looked curiously at Peignton to see if he shared her discomfort , but never did a man look more serene and unperturbed .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 3]: Happy too !
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 29]: The thrill of pleasurable excitement which in her case was a real , though secondary sensation , was , to judge by appearance , all-pervading in his case .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 14]: His eyes shone , the tired-out look had disappeared ; his lips smiled .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 10]: `` What a good thing a good car is !
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 33]: I used to swear by walking , but the time has come when I find it very agreeable to slip into a cushioned seat , and be whirled where I would go .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 16]: There 's something mysteriously fatiguing about decorating churches ; have n't you found it so ?
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 26]: Perhaps it is the necessity of keeping quiet and forbearing from expressing oneself as one otherwise would , when one is unexpectedly scratched or bruised .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 10]: In any case , I _ am _ tired .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 3]: And hungry !
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 12]: It is good of you to offer to feed me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 18]: Cassandra smiled with the comfortable assurance of one who takes perfect meals as a matter of course .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 40]: There was no consciousness of cold mutton , no fear of a heavy pudding , to mar her enjoyment of an unexpected guest , but having never experienced a housekeeper 's anxiety , she failed to appreciate the relief .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 13]: `` I hope they will give you something fit to eat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 12]: `` And afterwards ... Will you show me your garden ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 7]: `` I have no special garden .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 5]: I do nothing myself .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 26]: I 'm always making up my mind to take over a little corner , but it takes a long time to make up my mind .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 9]: I do n't want to dig and delve .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 13]: I enjoy the flowers better when I get them without any trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 13]: It would be simply an effort to try to find an interest .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 19]: -- Do you believe in troubling to find an interest , when it does n't come naturally ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 19]: `` Yes , '' Dane said simply , and Cassandra stared at him with a feeling of check .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 23]: She had not expected that quiet `` yes '' ; it carried with it a finality which put an end to argument .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 12]: `` I have had to do it , you see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 3]: he added .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 26]: `` The thing which _ did _ interest me became impossible , so I was obliged to find something else to fill the gap . ''
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 13]: Cassandra lay back against the cushions with an exaggerated sigh of resignation .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 5]: `` Oh , dear !
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 9]: here we are back at our Second Bests !
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 22]: I hate Second Bests , and makeshifts of every description , and I do n't recognise any obligation to adopt them .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 29]: If I can gain an interest only at the cost of something it does n't interest me to do , how can it be an interest at all ?
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 38]: I 'm talking nonsense , but it 's your fault ... You are so painfully philosophic ... Does a land agency _ really _ fill the gap left by the old regiment , and its associations ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 5]: `` Nothing near it .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 4]: But it helps .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 9]: It is several degrees better than nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 16]: Peignton spoke resolutely , but his face twitched , and Cassandra was smitten with compunction .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 7]: I should n't have said it .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 6]: It was mean of me .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 31]: When you are so brave ... '' Her voice sank to a tenderness of which she was unaware , as she asked the next question : `` What was it ?
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 13]: I never heard more than just that you had a breakdown ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 8]: `` Lungs , '' he said simply .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 25]: `` I had a cough , and it stuck to me , and I lost weight , but I never dreamt of anything serious .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 9]: It was a bit of a -- jar !
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 25]: I was packed off home to a sanatorium , and came out at the end of six months with a clean bill of health .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 12]: I 've been up to be vetted every few months since .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 42]: The last time it was a new fellow , and he could not spot the weak place , so I 'm all right , you see ; it has just made me physically a few years older than I really am .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 19]: Given care , and an outdoor life , I have as good a chance as another man . ''
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 6]: `` Oh , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 24]: So many people ... It 's _ nothing _ now , compared with what it used to be , '' Cassandra assented hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 23]: _ That _ was the reason of the subtly appealing look which had puzzled her from her first meeting with this man !
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 31]: He had looked death in the face ; had left the mimic playing at arms , to fight a hand-to-hand battle with that grim spectre through weary weeks and months .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 18]: Such an experience could not fail to leave its mark , however resolutely it might be ignored .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 36]: She was silent for some minutes , staring dreamily out of the window , while Dane in his turn studied her face , and wondered in masculine innocence why every woman did not wear chinchilla .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 12]: `` How do you take it when such blows come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 6]: she asked slowly at last .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 7]: `` Do you rage or sulk ?
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 15]: I suppose with ordinary human creatures it comes down to one of the two .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 19]: Only the saints are resigned , and I do n't fancy you -- '' `` No , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 6]: Very far from it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 7]: He laughed , then sobered quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 8]: `` I suppose I , -- sulked !
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 21]: I got the credit for taking it uncommonly well , but that was because I was too proud to fuss .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 3]: Pity hurt .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 19]: For my own selfish sake it was easier to bluff it out , and pretend to be hopeful .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 19]: But inside -- I went through a pretty fair imitation of hell in those first few weeks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 23]: In Cassandra 's low croon of sympathy sounded all the warmth of her Irish heart ; her eyes were liquid with sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 4]: `` And then ?
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 13]: Afterwards ... How soon did you -- '' `` Pull myself together ?
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 5]: Oh , I dunno !
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 14]: As soon as I -- began to pull round , I suppose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 5]: He shrugged his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 10]: `` Not much credit in that , was there ?
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 41]: I _ sulked _ , as you put it , so long as everything seemed over , but when I saw I was going to live on , I was obliged to rouse myself to see what could be done .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 4]: That 's natural !
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 19]: The more one has lost , the more important it is to make the most of what remains .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 24]: I could n't enjoy my life in the way I intended , but I was determined to enjoy it all the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 6]: `` And have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 3]: `` Rather !
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 5]: Look at me now .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 5]: Having a rattling time .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 17]: I 've never enjoyed things more in my life than during the last few weeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 6]: `` Church decorations included ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 6]: Cassandra enquired with malice prepense .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 45]: She wanted to see if he would look self-conscious at what was meant to be a veiled reference to his connection with Teresa , but he looked at her with the frankest of smiles and said : `` Yes ; did n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 13]: and it was she , not he , who suffered from embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 30]: At lunch Bernard was unaffectedly pleased to see the unexpected guest , and throughout its course talked to him persistently on topics which left Cassandra out in the cold .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 46]: She was evidently accustomed to be thus ignored , for her dreamy eyes showed that her thoughts were far away , and she replied so absently to Dane 's tentative attempts to draw her into the conversation , that he was not encouraged to persevere .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 36]: She awoke to sudden sharp consciousness , however , when Bernard began making suggestions for the afternoon , taking for granted that his guest was ready to accompany him wherever he should suggest to go .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 13]: `` I 've been wanting to drive round Boxley for some time .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 46]: You come along and give me your advice , '' he said finally , and again Cassandra knew a revival of youthful days in the tingle of anger , the incredulous load of disappointment , which like a real physical weight pressed upon her heart .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 33]: It was ridiculous , it was absurd , it was quite ludicrously out of proportion , to feel so torn about so small a thing , but she _ was _ torn .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 29]: It was in her at that moment to blaze into anger , to speak loud protesting words , to push aside her plate and dash from the room .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 47]: All the different impulses which had torn the girl Cassandra when defrauded of a promised treat of the nursery surged up suddenly in the breast of the woman who sat in silent dignity at the head of her table , smiling her unruffled , society smile .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 22]: Bernard , of course -- Bernard never took her into consideration ; but , -- _ What would Peignton say _ ?
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 12]: What he said was the easiest , most natural of explanations .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 5]: `` Thanks very much .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 20]: Another time I 'd be delighted , but this afternoon Lady Cassandra has promised to show me the gardens .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 11]: Perhaps we could fix a day for next week ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 24]: The Squire knitted his eyebrows , and looked from his guest to his wife , back again from his wife to his guest .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 22]: Plainly he was concerned , plainly also he was concerned for his guest 's sake , not that of his wife .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 21]: `` That 's very good of you , '' he said slowly , `` but er -- the whole afternoon ?
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 8]: Rather a fag , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 17]: You could have a walk round after lunch , and we 'd start at three . ''
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 14]: `` Thanks , but it 's against my principles to divide good things .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 16]: We 'll do Boxley next week , if you 'll give me the chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 14]: The Squire looked at his wife again and smiled , a good-natured smile .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 21]: He was obviously content that she should be amused , provided that he himself had no trouble in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 12]: `` That 's all right , then , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 8]: `` We 'll leave it at that .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 12]: Cass will be quite pleased to have someone to talk to .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 7]: Wo n't you , Cass ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 5]: `` Very pleased ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 4]: said Cassandra gravely .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 29]: It was beyond her at that moment to make pretence , but the earnestness of her face had the effect of launching her husband on an old grievance .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 14]: `` It 's your own fault , you know ; your own fault !
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 9]: I 'm always talking to you about it .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 8]: She wo n't make friends , Peignton !
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 19]: Lived within a couple of miles of Chumley all these years , and has n't a single friend .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 8]: Says there 's no one to know .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 2]: Rubbish !
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 18]: Do n't tell me ... Lots of 'em , if she took the trouble to find out .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 23]: Too proud , that 's the size of it , and they know it , and it gets 'em on the raw .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 14]: She 's made herself jolly unpopular , that 's what she 's done .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 12]: You ca n't deny that you have made yourself unpopular ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 30]: `` I am quite the most unpopular woman in the neighbourhood , '' Cassandra said , with the sideways tilt of the chin which Dane was beginning to recognise .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 16]: `` It 's humiliating , but I ca n't see that I am to blame .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 32]: I bore the Chumley people , and they bore me , and if I 'm to be bored at all , I so very much prefer to do it for myself .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 9]: I do n't complain of being alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , you do .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 6]: Not in words , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 31]: There are a jolly lot of ways in which a woman can rub it in , '' cried the Squire with a shrewdness at which Cassandra laughed with unruffled good-nature .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 4]: `` Poor Bernard !
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 6]: Have I rubbed it in ?
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 3]: Never mind !
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 43]: Grizel Beverley is going to prove a host in herself , and Captain Peignton is giving me a whole afternoon , and I 've been at the church for over an hour , decorating , and talking prettily to the other helpers .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 5]: Things are looking up .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 3]: Who knows !
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 13]: I may be quite sociable by the end of another year ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 8]: But the Squire refused to be cajoled .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 6]: `` Lots of 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 4]: he repeated pugilistically .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 3]: `` Lots .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 10]: All those houses , and a woman in each .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 5]: Do n't tell me !
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 8]: What 's the matter with Mrs Mawson ?
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 8]: What 's the matter with Miss Mawle ?
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 17]: What 's the matter with the Baxters , or the Gardiners , or Mrs Evans ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 6]: `` I like Mrs Evans .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 17]: I think I almost _ love _ the real Mrs Evans , '' Cassandra said thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 19]: `` I have always a feeling that if I were in trouble the real Mrs Evans would understand .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 11]: But one so seldom gets a glimpse of her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 10]: `` Do n't understand what you are talking about .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 10]: Who else do you get a glimpse of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 22]: `` The Vicar 's wife , '' said Cassandra , and rising from the table put an end to the discussion .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 35]: After lunch the two men sat together smoking and talking , but before the end of half an hour Peignton grew restless , and cast about in his mind for an excuse to escape .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 17]: Would Lady Cassandra come for him , or was he supposed to search for Lady Cassandra ?
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 20]: In any case the best of the day was passing , and it was folly to waste time indoors .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 28]: He strolled to the window , caught sight of a woman 's figure among the bushes on the nearer lawn , and lost no time in following .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 48]: It was Cassandra , as he had surmised , Cassandra in a knitted coat and cap of a soft rose colour which matched the flush on her cheeks ; her hands were thrust into her pockets , and she nodded welcome to him with a girlish air .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 25]: No girl could have looked younger , or fresher , or more free from care , and she felt as free as she looked .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 51]: The guilty feeling of the morning had disappeared , she had forgotten Teresa Mallison , and her claims , while her husband 's scepticism of the fact that any man should choose to spend an afternoon with her for his own enjoyment , had stirred up latent founts of coquetry .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 5]: Peignton should enjoy himself !
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 11]: She had not yet forgotten how to charm a man .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 21]: She would charm him now so that his afternoon in the spring garden should be a time to be remembered .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 6]: She need not have troubled .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 20]: Grave or gay , nothing that she could have said or done could possibly have failed to charm Peignton .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 15]: But of that fact she was , as yet , as ignorant as himself .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 36]: The south windows of the Court opened on to a stone terrace from which two separate flights of steps gave access to a succession of gardens , sloping down to the wide stretch of park .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 28]: At the head of each stairway , and against the house in the spaces between the windows stood stone vases filled with the gayest of spring flowers .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 33]: The fragrance of them filled the air , their colours flared gloriously against the dull grey background , and threw into striking contrast the green severity of the Dutch garden immediately beneath .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 45]: Here , later on in the year , the beds would exhibit gay specimens of the latest development in carpet gardening , but in the meantime they were bare , and the quaintly cut trees and shrubs had a grim , almost funereal austerity .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 19]: Lower down came a rose garden , with pergolas leading in four separate avenues to a centre dome .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 18]: In summer the rose garden was a fairyland of beauty , but its time was not yet .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 16]: The gardeners were busy pruning and training , cleverly inserting new branches among the old .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 43]: Peignton noticed that though Cassandra gave the men a pleasant greeting , she did not pause for any of the questioning , the propositions , the consultations as to how and where , which true garden lovers find irresistible under such circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 84]: She led the way to the lily beds , the ferneries , the herbaceous borders , and the sunk garden , all slumbering in the promise of beauty to come , last of all to the rockery , already ablaze with the gold of alyssum and the purple of aubretia , the little pockets between the stones filled with every variety of spring bulb : daffodils of yellow , white , and orange , flaring tulips , early hyacinths , and many-coloured anemones .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 31]: After the unbroken greenery of the higher terraces , the rockery appeared a riot of colour , as if the very spirit of spring had chosen it for an abode .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 29]: The air was sweet with fragrance , the sloping banks formed a protection against the breeze ; it seemed an ideal position in which to pause and rest .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 14]: `` Where , '' Dane asked tentatively , `` does one sit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 5]: `` Wherever one can .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 12]: On the least bumpy stone within reach , '' Cassandra replied .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 36]: She seated herself in illustration upon a boulder covered with a cushion of shaded moss , and immediately began snipping leaves from a shrub of scented verbena , the which she inhaled with languid enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 11]: `` Just avoid stalks , and you are all right .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 29]: Saxifrages _ like _ being sat on ; they are even grateful if you stamp upon them with strong boots , so you need feel no scruples . ''
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 16]: She held the lemon leaf poised in air , studying his face with curious eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 12]: `` You are rather given to scruples , are n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 7]: Your conscience is very active ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 22]: `` I 'm afraid it is , '' Dane said regretfully , as he in his turn selected an impromptu seat .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 13]: `` My people were all Friends , so it 's an inheritance .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 15]: A Nonconformist conscience has a terrible persistence ; there 's no living it down .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 18]: It 's been a handicap to me many times , obtruding itself when it was n't wanted .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 14]: One does n't seem to have much personal connection with one 's conscience .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 28]: It seems so entirely independent of will , that there 's no kudos attached to having a lively one , or no blame if he 's quiescent .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 13]: Mine happens to be of the persistent kind , and particularly long-lived .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 16]: He was a worry to me in the nursery ; he 's a worry to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 38]: I do n't think -- '' he paused for a moment , as if judicially weighing his words -- `` I do n't think I 've ever been able to do wrong with any real satisfaction ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 29]: They looked at each other and laughed , but Cassandra hastily lowered her eyes , affecting to bend over a further bed in search of a new fragrance .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 16]: In reality she was afraid that her eyes might show the tenderness of her heart .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 57]: The man 's expression as he looked at her had been so full of goodness and honesty that the hidden impulse had been to stretch out her own hand and touch his , to stroke it , and hold it close , and say such fond words as women will , when their hearts are touched .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 5]: `` You dear thing !
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 4]: You dear thing !
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 8]: what harm have _ you _ done ?
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 10]: _ Your _ conscience may sit at ease ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 27]: ... With a fellow-woman one would have carried out the impulse , but convention forbade such sincerities between a man and a woman unconnected by blood .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 9]: Convention decreed that genuine feeling should be disguised .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 6]: `` Ca n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 4]: said Cassandra lightly .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 8]: `` Oh , _ I _ can !
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 14]: I sinned gloriously in short frocks , with never a thought of consequences .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 30]: My chum sister was my partner in wickedness , we planned all our rebellions together , but when it came to the bit , she missed half the fun .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 38]: I could bury everything in the joy of the moment , and forget there was such a thing as to-morrow ... She had no sooner done the deed , than she began to be visited by qualms .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 24]: I did n't object as much as I might have done , for if the sin was edible -- and it generally was .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 11]: -- there was so much the more left for me .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 18]: She used to sit and shiver , and say : ` Cass , you 'll be ill !
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 8]: What _ will _ Mother say ? '
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 8]: while I ate up her share . ''
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 7]: `` And were you ill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 18]: `` I forget , '' said Cassandra , and looked at him with a rebel 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 8]: `` But I ate my cake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 33]: Before he had time to answer , suddenly , impetuously she had sprung to her feet , and darted round a corner of the rockery to shelter behind a clump of shrubs .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 14]: Peignton followed , alert but mystified , but the explanation came swiftly enough .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 49]: From the raised path which curved through the park to the entrance of the house came a familiar whirr , and the next moment there sped into sight a large grey car carrying two men on the box , and within the tonneau one large , elderly dame .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 24]: From the distance it was not possible to distinguish her face , but Cassandra recognised her all the same , and groaned aloud .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 7]: `` Mrs Freune ... from Bagton .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 8]: What _ shall _ I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 8]: `` They 'll look for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 6]: `` She 'll make them .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 6]: They 'll ask the gardeners .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 8]: They 'll say I 'm here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 7]: `` Let 's run away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 19]: She looked at him and her eyes danced , but the instincts of hospitality put up a fight .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 7]: `` It 's a long drive !
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 3]: Twelve miles .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 6]: She 'll want tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 7]: `` Does she stay long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 3]: `` Hours .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 8]: And talks politics into the bargain . ''
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 5]: `` Lloyd George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 5]: And the German Invasion .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 7]: There 's no avoiding it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 7]: `` But it 's a crime !
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 26]: On an afternoon like this , when the sun is shining ... You ca n't go ... '' `` She 's driven twelve miles . ''
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 8]: `` Twelve miles in a good car !
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 4]: What 's that ?
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 17]: She 'll enjoy her tea all the more for waiting ... Could n't we -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 25]: Cassandra came a step nearer , her voice sank to the thrilling note in which of old she had concocted mischief in the schoolroom .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 3]: `` Listen !
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 10]: ... there 's a summer-house near the north gate .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 10]: It has a locked cupboard with things for tea .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 30]: I keep them there for my especial use ... If we ran down this path quickly ... before she arrives -- '' `` We could have tea there together ?
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 10]: For goodness ' sake , let 's fly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 5]: `` But your conscience ?
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 4]: The Nonconformist conscience ?
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 9]: Are you sure you could enjoy -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 9]: `` She 's your visitor , not mine .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 5]: I have no scruples .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 7]: Only give me the chance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 8]: `` On your head be it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 25]: cried Cassandra , and bending low , darted between the shrubs towards a winding path which led in the opposite direction from the house .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 6]: Peignton followed with eager steps .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 5]: THE SKIRTS OF CHANCE .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 38]: Now that Lent was over dinner parties came on with a rush , started , as was only discreet , with a state gathering at the Court , when the county was invited to welcome the bride .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 32]: The Vicar and his wife were the sole representatives of Chumley proper , but Dane Peignton was in request , as an odd man is bound to be in the countryside .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 22]: `` It will be deadly dull , '' Cassandra had warned her friend , `` but it has to be done .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 23]: Brace up , and go through it bravely , and if you do n't like it you need never try again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 10]: `` I wo n't , '' Grizel said frankly .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 28]: `` A duty is a duty , and has to be done whether you like it or not , but I choose my pleasures to suit myself .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 27]: If I 'm amused I 'll go , -- if I 'm not , all the saddles of mutton in the world wo n't tempt me .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 31]: It always amuses me to be with you , my dear , but judging from the specimens I 've already seen , it 's a very , very heavy county .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 8]: The women are heavy in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 15]: I tremble to think of what they must be in the drawing-room after dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 9]: Could I do anything to jolt them up ?
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 17]: Put on a black gown , or do a little skirt dancing , or tell stories ?
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 8]: I could tell some awakening stories ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 10]: But Cassandra shook her head and issued her orders .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 35]: `` You are to wear your wedding dress , and behave yourself like a sweet young bride , and do credit to yourself , and to me , and to your husband 's books !
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 13]: When you go to Rome , do as the Romans do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 64]: When the night of the dinner arrived the sweet young bride repaired to her husband 's dressing-room _ en route _ from the bathroom to her own apartment , and squatted on the floor to watch _ him _ shave , with her white gown wrapped around a foam of lacey under-garments , and her white shoes kicked off on to the rug .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 50]: She looked young , and fresh , and blooming , and brought with her a delicious odour of violets , and it appeared to afford her intense satisfaction to watch Martin lather his chin , and twist it from side to side for the convenience of the safety razor .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 10]: `` Darling , you _ do _ look plain !
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 10]: I love you dreadfully when I see you shave .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 9]: All that trouble to spare me a beard !
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 10]: ... Do n't cut yourself , like a precious .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 41]: I do so object to bits of cotton-wool ... Does n't it feel nice and married to have me sitting here , watching you , in my bare tootsies , and knowing that even the Vicaress herself could not object ?
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 9]: She 'll be there to-night , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 5]: What will she wear ?
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 23]: -- A black satin , cut in a V , with a pendant of agate , and a cap with an aigrette .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 3]: Dear thing !
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 12]: I must remember to enquire for the Mothers ' Meeting . ''
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 24]: Martin , his chin violently undulating , murmured a word which was evidently of a warning nature , but Grizel took no notice .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 18]: Her hands were clasped round her knees , she was smiling , in a soft reflective fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 11]: `` No , '' she said slowly , `` no !
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 9]: this first year must be just for ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 24]: -- I am so thankful that Katrine is away and so happy , for our own sakes , as well as her own .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 13]: I am thankful there are no other near relatives to trouble about .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 20]: I do n't want _ Anyone _ to come between us this first year , not even -- that !
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 21]: A year or two alone together we must have , and then , -- we 'll pray for twins ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 14]: Martin 's sureness of hand alone saved him from the necessity of cotton-wool .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 12]: He turned round , smiling , lathered , twinkling with humour .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 6]: `` Why be so greedy ?
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 18]: Surely _ one _ -- '' `` No , no -- two would be twice as nice .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 12]: You get on so slowly with one at a time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 31]: She bent her head still lower , so that her chin rested upon her knees ; her golden eyes stared into space , her shoulders heaved with a regretful sigh .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 12]: `` No , '' she said at last , `` no !
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 7]: I suppose it would not do .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 15]: Triplets _ are _ vulgar , but oh , Martin , think of it !
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 41]: -- _ three _ ducks , all in a row , each with its long white tail , and its little ribbons round its wrists , and its little gold sovereign hanging round its neck ... The Queen 's Bounty !
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 9]: And oh , Martin , think , think !
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 15]: what an advertisement for your books ... It would be in all the papers .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 19]: ` Mrs Martin Beverley , wife of the well-known novelist , yesterday became the mother of three daughters .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 7]: -LRB- They must be daughters ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 20]: Later enquiries at the house elicited the news that the mother and family were all doing well . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 5]: `` Really , Grizel !
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 3]: really ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 5]: cried Martin , protesting .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 7]: `` You make me blush . ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 6]: `` Oh , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 16]: Grizel sighed , and rose to her feet in one swift , astonishingly agile movement .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 4]: `` Bear up .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 10]: There 's no use getting agitated before the time .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 7]: It might be only twins ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 28]: She strolled out of the room , and seating herself on the chair before her own mirror , gave herself into the hands of the waiting maid .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 16]: `` Now then , Marie , make me look like a sweet young bride . ''
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 4]: Marie looked complacent .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 46]: It was easy to obey that order , since her mistress was radiant with beauty and happiness , and there lay waiting on the bed a gown , which looked as if it had been blown straight out of a fairy tale for her adornment .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 18]: The ordinary white satin was far too dull and substantial to have a place in its concoction .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 21]: It was a mass of cobweb lace of extraordinary antiquity and frailness , mounted on a lining of silver gauze .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 46]: The fine folds accentuated the reed-like slimness of Grizel 's figure , the misty indefiniteness of shading suited to a marvel the small face , with its white cheeks and amber eyes , that face which was at once so colourless , and so aglow .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 41]: Marie looking at the reflection in the mirror , pushed aside the cases of jewels , and lifting a piece of tulle swathed it lightly round her mistress ' head , allowing one long end to flow down the back .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 24]: It was unconventional , it was daring , but the effect was irresistible , and Marie stood aside heaving a sigh of triumph .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 4]: `` No jewels .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 4]: Only the gauze .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 7]: In effect -- a veil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 72]: So it came to pass that when Mr and Mrs Beverley made their entrance into the great drawing-room of the _ Court _ , there came to one and all of the assembled guests the impression of a creature half human , half fairy , poised midway between heaven and earth , aglow with that absolute , unshadowed happiness , which is seldom given to mortals to see or to enjoy .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 18]: It was indeed the primitive note in Grizel 's temperament , which made such a condition possible .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 28]: The least introspective of mortals , she accepted happiness as manna from heaven , throve on to-day 's supply , and confidently expected the morrow 's supply .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 40]: The minor trials , which would have dimmed the rapture of another bride , pricked her for the moment , and were then cast aside , and dismissed from thought , as completely as though they had never existed .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 24]: There were occasions when such abstraction brought about material _ contretemps _ , but of the mental lightening there could be no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 25]: Everyone in the room received the same impression of radiance as the bride entered , but on the different minds the impression acted differently .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 59]: The Vicar 's wife , clad as had been foretold , in black satin and aigretted cap , but showing a pendant of cameo , instead of agate , on the discreet decolletage , felt a sudden unreasoning disposition towards tears , and the good man , her husband , breathed a mental `` God keep her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 9]: but the Hon. Mrs Mawson was distinctly shocked .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 37]: She was the Evangelical magnate whose religion seemed largely to consist in disapproving of other people 's enjoyments , and the bride 's obtrusive happiness appeared to her as a deliberate `` tempting of Providence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 12]: Moreover , she disapproved of the costume as theatrical and unusual .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 8]: Why not satin , like everybody else ?
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 4]: And no jewels !
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 12]: The niece of Lady Griselda Dundas must possess jewels of price .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 6]: Then why that bare neck ?
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 25]: Mrs Mawson was wearing her own rubies , and took it as a personal slight that the bride had come to meet her unadorned .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 18]: Midway between the two extremes flowed the general verdict , but Grizel was blissfully unconscious of criticism .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 40]: She went through the necessary greetings of acquaintances , among whom she was surprised to recognise Teresa Mallison , and then exchanged a few words with her hostess before leading the way to dinner on the Squire 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 28]: Cassandra looked as usual , both tired and vivid ; she gave a caressing pressure to her friend 's elbow , and murmured softly : `` Exquisite .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 3]: About eighteen !
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 14]: ... Talk hard , Grizel , for pity 's sake -- talk hard !
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 5]: The atmosphere is freezing .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 10]: At the last moment Mona Fenchurch sent a wire .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 2]: Flue .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 7]: I had to send for Teresa .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 9]: She 's so good about filling gaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 6]: `` Oh , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 4]: Grizel said significantly .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 24]: Of course Teresa was delighted to come , especially when by good luck it was Peignton 's predestined partner who had fallen out !
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 38]: She stood by his side now -- flushed , silent , a trifle gauche , for it was something of an ordeal to meet the people who politely ignored her existence in the life of the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 21]: Grizel divined something of the cause of the girl 's embarrassment , and sent her a smile of beaming friendliness .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 8]: all had turned out for the best .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 24]: Nobody wanted Mona Fenchurch for the pleasure of her company , and her absence had paved the way to a lovers ' meeting .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 17]: Captain Peignton looked supremely content , and how sensible of the girl to stick to blue !
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 16]: Teresa , however , was not at all self-congratulatory on the subject of her gown .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 37]: If she had had a day 's notice , -- even half a day , she could have dashed up to town , and equipped herself in something newer , and more worthy of the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 23]: She was miserably conscious that the blue dress was past its freshness , and had already paid several visits to the Court .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 9]: The dinner which followed was lengthy and stately .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 6]: It was also undeniably dull !
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 48]: At one end of the table Grizel chatted and leant her elbows on the table , and kept the Squire in complacent chuckles of laughter , but their gaiety , instead of spreading , seemed to throw into greater contrast the forced conversations of the other guests .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 37]: With the exception of Teresa Mallison they were all elderly people , who had driven over many miles of country to perform a social duty , and neither expected nor received any pleasure in its execution .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 19]: They all knew each other , met at intervals , and discoursed together on the same well-worn topics .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 12]: Lady Rose talked garden , and was an expert on bulbs .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 35]: Sir George Everley , her partner , described all bulbs vaguely as daffodils , lived simply and solely for `` huntin ' , '' and would in all probability die for it another day .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 43]: The Vicar 's partner lived for bridge , and his wife had fallen to the share of an old general who looked upon food and drink as the events of the moment , and had no intention of losing a good chance .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 37]: Long years of dining out had made him an expert at the game of starting his partner on a hobby during an interval between courses , and then giving her her head until the next stop .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 19]: and what is the latest good work in the parish , Mrs Evans , eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 25]: he enquired genially , as he waited the advent of fish , and then with the help of a , `` Did you though ?
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 5]: God bless my soul !
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 3]: Pine work !
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 4]: fine work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 41]: he was left free to enjoy his fare , and make mental notes on the flavouring of the sauce , until such time as he had leisure to give Mrs Evans another lead on the vexed question of the choir .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 28]: Lord Kew sat on Cassandra 's left side , and threw depressed crumbs of conversation to his companion , the stout wife of the huntin ' squire .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 34]: It was said of Lord Kew that he could not talk for five minutes together without bringing in the German invasion , and his conviction that England was galloping headlong to the dogs .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 45]: He prophesied as much to the squire 's wife in less than the prescribed time , and she said that `` something ought to be done , '' and seizing on the word `` dog '' introduced to his notice her two pet Chows .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 41]: From time to time also Cassandra helped her along with a few words , leaving Martin to make the acquaintance of his right-hand neighbour , who had heard of his books , and really must get them from the library .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 10]: `` Do you write under your own name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 60]: Teresa sat like a poker , still and silent , vouchsafing monosyllabic replies to the formalities of a county magnate , about whom she knew everything , but who had got it firmly impressed into his sluggish brain that she was someone else , and accordingly insisted upon referring to people and incidents of whom she had never heard .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 57]: Now and then came a happy moment when Peignton gave her his attention , and smiled encouragement into her eyes , but he was working hard to rouse a chilly lady to animation , and even on occasion throwing an occasional bold challenge across the table , where a couple seemed settling down into permanent silence .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 21]: Teresa had the impression that Dane was putting aside his own amusement as something entirely subservient to the general good .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 17]: It was almost as though he felt a responsibility , and was working for a reward .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 30]: She never suspected that the reward came more than once in a glance from Cassandra 's eyes , and a smile of appreciation flashed down the length of table .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 73]: Cassandra 's head and neck rose above the banked-up flowers , her cheeks were flushed , the stars of emeralds on her throat sent out green flames of light , she looked brilliant and beautiful , a fitting chatelaine for the stately old house , but it was not her beauty which appealed to Peignton 's heart ; it was the subtle _ want _ which mysteriously he felt able to supply .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 36]: He did not trouble himself to enquire into the nature of this strong mutual sympathy , for he was a practical man accustomed to do the next thing , and not trouble about the future .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 22]: To-night Cassandra was a hostess struggling with an unusually depressing set of guests , and he expended himself to help her .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 21]: Looking up the length of table , Grizel 's face was like a flowering shrub in an avenue of cedars .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 13]: Peignton looked at her and felt a pang of something like anger .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 7]: _ She _ was content enough !
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 6]: She had everything she wanted .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 35]: Things were cursedly unfair ... In the drawing-room Grizel as the bride was handed round for five-minute conversations , and being in an amiable mood exerted herself to be all things to all women .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 63]: She talked `` huntin ' '' and she talked bridge , she asked advice concerning her garden , she listened sweetly to details of May Meetings , and vouchsafed copious and entirely untrue descriptions of an author at home ; only with the Vicar 's wife did she allow herself the privilege of being natural , and saying what she really meant .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 12]: Mrs Evans was elderly and stout , parochial and intensely proper .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 32]: Grizel was young and unconventional to an extreme , yet beneath the dissimilarity there existed a sympathy between the two women which both divined , and both failed equally to understand .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 30]: Grizel knew that Mrs Evans 's brain viewed her with suspicion , but she was complacently aware that Mrs Evans 's heart was not in sympathy with her brain .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 11]: Was it not exactly the same in her own case ?
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 62]: Mentally she had pronounced the Vicar 's wife a parochial bore , the type of middle-aged orthodox , prudish woman whom her soul abhorred , but , as a matter of fact , she did not abhor her at all , for the eyes of the soul saw down beneath the stiffness and the propriety , and recognised a connecting link .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 33]: `` If I were in trouble , I 'd like to put my head down on her nice broad shoulder , and , -- she 'd like to have me there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 43]: cried Grizel , sinking down in a soft little swirl of lace and silver by the side of the chair which held the portly black satin form , and resting one little hand on its arm with a gesture of half-caressing intimacy .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 7]: Are the Mothers still meeting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 14]: Mrs Evans preened herself , and did her honest best to look distressed .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 16]: `` My dear , I am afraid you _ mean _ to be naughty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 4]: Grizel nodded cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 9]: `` I do ... Are n't you glad ?
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 9]: It 's no use pretending to be shocked .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 29]: You have a whole parish-full of proper people who do what they ought , and say what they should , and I come in as a refreshing change .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 8]: Besides , I really mean quite well !
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 27]: Who knows , -- after half a dozen years of Chumley influence , I may be as douce and staid as any one of them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 78]: At this point the obvious thing for Mrs Evans to do was plainly to express a hope such might be the case ; she knew it , and opened her mouth to utter the aspiration , but as she did so she inclined her head to look down into the dimpling radiance of the bride 's face , and once again her heart softened , and she felt that mysterious pricking at the back of her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 22]: `` My dear , '' she said gently , `` I -- I think I prefer you as you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 28]: Grizel did not answer , but her eyes softened , and she slipped her hand an inch forward so that it pressed against the black satin sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 22]: She was thinking happily that she had already two friends in Chumley , Cassandra , and -- the Vicar 's wife !
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 33]: Seeing a pause in the conversation , a small woman in pink satin made a swoop for the seat next the bride , and eyed her with a bright , birdlike smile .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 29]: This was Mrs Fotheringham -LRB- with a small `` f '' -RRB- , a lady who combined having nothing to say with a positively uninterrupted flow of conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 25]: She overcame the apparent difficulty by pouring forth a flood of personal questions , from the storehouse of a curiosity which knew no bounds .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 14]: She pounced upon Grizel now , as a hawk pounces upon its prey .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 8]: `` So pleased to meet you to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 9]: So unfortunate to miss you when I called .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 9]: I 've been so longing to meet you .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 7]: Knew you so well by name .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 7]: You were Miss Grizel Dundas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 7]: `` Niece of Lady Griselda ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 9]: `` Lived with her , did n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 6]: Sort of adopted child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 6]: `` All your life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 8]: `` But of course you had parents ?
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 30]: -- '' `` No -- '' The `` no '' was devilment pure and simple , and gave Mrs Fotheringham what is technically described as a `` sensation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 12]: She jerked , stared , and finally forced a wooden laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 6]: `` Oh , I see .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 4]: Stupid of me .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 10]: Died , I suppose , at your birth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 4]: `` One after .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 4]: One before . ''
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 4]: `` How sad .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 7]: Very eccentric , was n't she ?
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 6]: Lady Griselda , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 14]: I 've heard that she was exceedingly -- '' `` She was . ''
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 8]: `` But you got on with her ?
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 21]: Must have done , of course , or she would not ... Quite attached to you , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 4]: `` So nice !
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 14]: And you stayed with her until her death , and married immediately after ?
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 10]: It was immediately after , was it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 5]: `` Several months . ''
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 11]: `` So nice for you that you had Mr Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 7]: He must be a proud man .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 10]: Not many women would have given up so much .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 10]: But I 'm sure you never regret it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 8]: `` Oh , but I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 4]: cried Grizel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 5]: _ Often _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 45]: She was getting bored by this time , and decided that this might be a favourable point at which to end the catechism , so she rose and strolled across the room , leaving Mrs Fotheringham to express her consternation to the nearest listener .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 4]: `` How extraordinary !
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 4]: Did you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 8]: She said she _ does _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 17]: But Mrs Evans had known the question-monger from a child , and stood upon no ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 13]: `` You had no right to put such a question , Flora .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 4]: It was impertinent .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 17]: Mrs Beverley answered in the only manner possible , by turning it into a joke . ''
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 5]: `` I suppose so .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 7]: It must have been a joke .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 7]: She _ looks _ happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 27]: The birdlike eyes roved towards Martin , who had just entered the room with the other men , and subjected him to a curious scrutiny . ''
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 11]: _ Do _ you think he looks worth it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 11]: `` My dear , it is immaterial what I think !
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 17]: How can any outsider judge of the worth which another woman 's husband represents to herself ?
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 8]: It 's not a question of credentials .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 10]: It 's a question of _ fit _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 21]: Half an hour later the Squire buttonholed Peignton in a corner of the room , and gave him his instructions .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 10]: `` I 've ordered the car for Miss Mallison .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 17]: See her safely home , will you , and take it on to your own place ?
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 14]: Might as well do two good turns while it 's about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 22]: His look gave significance to the words , and Peignton could not do less than declare his pleasure at the suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 27]: As a matter of fact , however , it was not pleasure of which he was conscious at that moment , but something unaccountably like disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 18]: He had not expected the evening to end so soon ; he was unwilling to be dismissed .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 23]: Throughout the long dinner he had been subconsciously looking forward to something to come ; and he now felt defrauded and chilled .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 57]: He had imagined that he would have had five minutes ' talk with Lady Cassandra -- that they would laugh together , and in the meeting of eyes exchange confidences which it would have been indiscreet to put into words , but Cassandra was surrounded by guests of honour , and apparently oblivious of his presence .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 26]: She turned with a start as he approached her with Teresa by his side , and received the girl 's adieux with a gracious smile .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 4]: `` So soon !
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 8]: Captain Peignton going to see you home .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 4]: That 's right .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 5]: _ Good _ night .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 12]: It was really noble of you to come to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 6]: So very many thanks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 24]: Her manner to the girl was all that could be wished , but as she turned to Peignton there came an unmistakable chill .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 20]: Her face , her voice , the fleeting touch of her hand were alike cold , devoid of friendship .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 16]: Cassandra was disappointed too , and , womanlike , vented her displeasure on her fellow-sufferer .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 19]: She also had looked forward to a few brief moments of communion after the emptiness of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 14]: She also had the baffled feeling of one who has waited for naught .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 29]: The while she listened to Lady Mawson 's dreary pronouncements she watched the dark figure follow the girl from the room , and a pang pierced her heart .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 7]: `` Oh , to be young !
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 11]: To be young , -- and to be loved ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 17]: Peignton struggled into his coat , and muttered savagely when a stud caught in the lining .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 20]: His usual mood was so serene that this sudden irritability and depression was as puzzling as it was disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 23]: He asked himself curtly what the devil was wrong , and made a swift mental summary of the wine consumed at dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 13]: Nothing wrong , but these elaborate feasts were not in his line .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 5]: They bored him stiff .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 54]: Another time he would decline ... At this point Teresa made her appearance wrapped in a white opera cloak , with her mother 's best lace scarf draped over her head , and Dane 's depression lightened , as he smiled at her and took his place by her side in the car .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 23]: He felt a pleasant sense of intimacy as the door shut , and they were alone together speeding through the darkened park .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 37]: He had been thinking a good deal of marriage lately , more than he had ever done before , but he did not realise that at the same time he had been thinking less of Teresa .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 22]: He thought of her now , warmed by her presence , and by the natural rebound from his fit of irritation .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 18]: She looked pretty in that white kit , -- that lace over her face was uncommonly becoming .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 37]: He had divined the difficulty of her position during the evening , pitchforked among a number of people who as a rule ignored her existence , and he had admired the quiet composure of her manner .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 5]: A nice little girl .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 5]: A dear little girl .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 10]: A pretty , clever , uncommonly sensible little girl .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 16]: Teresa looked up , met the approval in his eyes , and thrilled with happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 16]: The evening had come as an unexpected and golden ending to a long dull day .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 68]: At tea-time she had been dismally counting over the days which had elapsed since her last sight of Peignton , dismally realising that no mutual engagements lay ahead , and then suddenly the summons had arrived which had placed her by his side during the length of that long dinner , and , best of all , ensured this _ tete-a-tete _ drive in the friendly dimness .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 69]: Surely now -- if he cared at all , he would open his heart -- But Peignton was far from such an intention ; he was opening his lips to make some casual remark , half-bantering , half-caressing , as had grown to be his habit when with Teresa , when there suddenly came about one of those small happenings which are monumental in their effect on life .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 27]: The chauffeur , steering out of the lodge gate , took a sharp turn , and the inner wheels of the car descended into the ditch .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 49]: He was a skilful driver , and as a rule careful enough , but the necessity of turning out at night for the convenience of an insignificant guest had tried his temper , and he was not unwilling to prejudice Miss Mallison against a repetition of the drive .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 30]: In any case , the swerve was startling enough , and Teresa , feeling herself sinking through space , instinctively threw out her hands and grasped the nearest object .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 29]: For the moment she was unconscious that that object was Dane himself ; she simply found support , and clung , and Dane 's arms held her fast .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 59]: Two or three violent wrenches followed , as the whole strength of the car struggled to mount the incline , and meantime , locked in each other 's arms , the man and the girl swayed together , this way and that , backwards and forwards , until with a final jerk and groan the roadway was reached .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 26]: All the time Teresa had not uttered a sound , but now that safety was assured , a sobbing breath quavered from between her lips .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 24]: It was a pathetic little sound , like the sob of a child in pain , and the red lips were very near .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 28]: From pure instinct , rather than any definite intention , Peignton bent still nearer , and kissed those lips into silence , murmuring gentle words of encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 7]: `` Poor girl -- poor dear !
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 11]: It 's all over ... We are all right now .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 8]: You are not frightened , Teresa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 12]: He held her fast , resisting a faint movement to escape .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 8]: He did not want her to go .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 20]: He wanted to hold her , to kiss her again , and feel her lips tremble against his own .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 21]: The sore , wounded feeling of the evening had disappeared , his heart was beating with strong , rapid strokes .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 20]: The electric lamp showed the girl 's face flushed and tremulous , the eyes shyly drooping before his own .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 28]: He bent over her and whispered a question , knowing full well what the answer would be , but wanting to hear it , all the same .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 13]: `` Are you angry with me for kissing you , Teresa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 6]: The girl shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 8]: Her low voice sounded young and sweet .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 10]: `` Oh , no ... I 'm glad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 7]: `` Why are you glad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 11]: `` Because you , -- you _ care _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 5]: said Teresa , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 67]: For a breath Dane hesitated , and in that pause something ominous gripped at his heart , and like a man who has made a false step on the edge of a precipice he saw a glimpse of an abyss ; but the next moment youth and blood rose to the appeal , and he kissed the soft lips once and again , murmuring appropriate protestations .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 10]: `` Of course I care -- who would n't ?
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 12]: I 've cared a long time ... And you care too ?
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 9]: You do care for me , Teresa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 8]: `` Oh , _ yes _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 14]: The answer came with a fervour which could not fail to be infectious .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 11]: `` Enough -- some day -- to be my wife ?
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 13]: I wish I had more to offer you , little girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 11]: `` Oh , I want nothing , I want nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 13]: I would marry you if you were a workman in a cottage .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 9]: Sooner -- than a _ king _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 4]: It was true .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 38]: The girl 's voice rang with a sincerity of passion , which was startling in its contrast to the man 's light tones , and Peignton , realising the contrast , was at once touched and abashed .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 6]: `` You dear girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 4]: he said softly .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 6]: `` Thank you , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 17]: I 'm not worth it , but -- I 'll be good to you , Teresa !
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 7]: You shall never regret it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 9]: Teresa laughed at the absurdity of the thought .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 27]: It seemed impossible that anything in the nature of regret , or grief , or anxiety , or even boredom could ever again cloud her heart .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 9]: She had reached the pinnacle of her desires .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 12]: To know that Dane loved her meant absolute , unclouded happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 7]: He would go on loving her .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 10]: Therefore she would go on being blissful and content .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 13]: As in the fairy tales , they would be happy ever after .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 14]: `` I never knew that it was possible to be so happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 6]: sighed Teresa in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINE .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 5]: THE GIFT OF CREATION .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 26]: Teresa entered the quiet house , cast a look at the drawing-room door , and realised with relief that her mother had retired to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 41]: Probably she would be awake , and would expect the returning daughter to enter her room in passing , and give a history of the evening 's adventures , but Teresa had no intention of doing anything of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 26]: Pausing for a moment in the hall , she took off her slippers and crept noiselessly past the dreaded portals up to the third floor .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 20]: To-morrow morning there would be reprisals , but she had news to tell which would speedily turn the tide .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 28]: The flood of questions and curiosities which were bound to flow from the maternal lips would be intolerable to-night , nevertheless Teresa felt the need of speech .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 19]: The relief , the joy , the triumph of the moment seemed more than she could endure alone .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 25]: She needed someone to listen , not to talk , and Mary had been trained by long years of self-abnegation to fill that post .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 13]: Teresa entered her sister 's room and turned on the electric switch .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 30]: Mary lay asleep , her face showing yellow against the whiteness of the pillow , her hair screwed together in a walnut-like knob at the top of her head .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 20]: She stirred , opened listless eyes to stare at her sister , and automatically struggled to a sitting position .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 4]: `` Got back ?
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 11]: -- Do you -- is there anything you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 15]: Teresa sat down on the side of the bed and threw back her cloak .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 43]: In the plainly furnished bedroom her blue dress became at once a rich and gorgeous garment , the trifling ornament on her neck gleamed with a new splendour ; to Mary 's dazzled eyes she appeared a vision of beauty and happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 6]: `` What should I want ?
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 2]: Cocoa ?
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 2]: Coffee ?
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 5]: You funny old Martha !
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 8]: your thoughts never get away from housekeeping .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 16]: I do n't want anything ; not one single thing in the whole wide world .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 15]: I 've got so much already that I can hardly bear it ... Mary !
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 4]: I 'm engaged .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 6]: He _ does _ care .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 6]: He asked me to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 29]: asked Mary blankly , and Teresa , staring at her in indignation , realised that , incredible as it appeared , this ignorance was real , not feigned .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 39]: A pricking of curiosity made itself felt ; since this most obtuse of sisters had noticed nothing between herself and Dane , it would be interesting to see whom she would select as a possible _ fiance _ .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 10]: She smiled , and said , `` Guess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 9]: `` Mr Hunter , '' said Mary promptly .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 5]: `` Gerald Hunter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 49]: Teresa was transfixed with surprise at the unexpectedness of the reply , for Gerald Hunter , the young partner of the local doctor , had come to the neighbourhood some months later than Dane himself , by which time she had no attention to bestow upon another man .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 33]: Hunter was a member of the tennis club , he made a welcome addition to local dances and bridge teas ; occasionally on Sunday afternoons he had called and stayed to tea .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 39]: Teresa was aware that he had a dark complexion , a strong , overhand serve , and a dancing step which went well with her own , but beyond these preliminaries her mind had not troubled to go .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 13]: `` What on earth made you think it was Gerald Hunter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 6]: `` He admires you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 6]: `` Oh , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 31]: Teresa glanced complacently into the tilted mirror which showed a reflection of flaxen hair , pink cheeks , and rounded shoulders , sufficiently attractive to merit any man 's admiration .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 21]: The same law of contrast which made the dress appear rich and elaborate came into operation as regards its wearer .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 28]: The mirror reflected the faces of both sisters , and it was not unnatural that Teresa should feel a thrill of pleasure at her own fair looks .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 5]: `` Oh , well !
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 5]: But that 's different .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 8]: Lots of people may _ admire _ .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 5]: Guess again , Mary !
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 11]: Somebody far , far more exciting than Mr Hunter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 6]: But Mary shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 13]: `` If it 's not Mr Hunter , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 5]: Tell me yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 4]: `` Dane Peignton !
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 10]: Oh , Mary , why did n't you guess ?
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 38]: I 've cared always -- from the very first hour I saw him , and I knew he cared too , I was sure of it -- and yet , one _ ca n't _ be sure !
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 14]: When one cares so much , it seems too good to be true .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 13]: He is so different from anyone else in this stupid little place .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 27]: He belongs to the world , and to people like ... like the people I met to-night , not to our poor , prosy little set .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 8]: He was the most popular man there .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 12]: He talked , and they listened ; he made things go .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 9]: They all liked him , and admired him .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 23]: He has been here only a few months , and they all treat him as a friend , and oh , Mary !
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 11]: you know what they are like to _ us _ ?
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 18]: If it had n't been for him I should have felt like a fish out of water .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 16]: They gushed , of course , they always gush , but one felt so apart .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 27]: Old Sir Henry sat on my other side , and persisted in mistaking me for Miss Pell , and talked of things I knew nothing about .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 16]: I am sure they were all wondering what on earth I was doing up there .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 9]: What will they think to-morrow when they hear !
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 9]: I 'm going to announce it at once .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 6]: I want everyone to know .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 20]: I 'd like to shout it from the church tower ... Oh , Mary , is n't it splendid ?
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 25]: Do n't you think I am the luckiest girl ... Do n't you think it is wonderful that he should care for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 7]: `` Yes ... Does he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 22]: There was an incredulity in the voice in which the words were put which arrested Teresa in her flow of eloquence .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 14]: She stared with lips agape , her blue eyes darkening in amaze . ''
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 5]: _ Does he _ ?
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 4]: Does he care ?
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 6]: ... You ask me that !
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 6]: What are you dreaming about ?
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 19]: If he did n't care , why in the world should he ask me to be his wife ?
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 10]: We are not rich ; we are not grand .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 16]: Ours is not exactly a _ lively _ family for a man to marry into .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 12]: He might have chosen a girl in such a different position .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 7]: Why should he choose me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 30]: Mary pulled the blankets over her thin chest , and appeared to consider the matter , her eyes resting on her sister 's face with a coolly critical scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 9]: `` Perhaps because -- you wanted him to !
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 17]: You generally do manage to get what you want , do n't you , Teresa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 9]: Teresa straightened herself with an air of offence .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 12]: `` There was no _ management _ about this , anyhow !
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 11]: Whatever I wanted , I did n't give myself away .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 15]: I never ran after him and made myself cheap , as some girls do .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 11]: It 's horrid of you to suggest such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 14]: Did I ever show that I cared for him when he was here ?
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 22]: I ca n't have done , or you would not have been so surprised when you heard of our engagement . ''
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 8]: `` I knew you cared for him .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 13]: You had a perfectly different face when he was in the room .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 4]: We all knew .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 15]: We were sorry for you , because we thought he did n't return it .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 12]: Mother was thinking of sending you to Aunt Emma 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 10]: `` Oh , she was , was she ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 23]: Teresa tossed her head once more , but the inner happiness was too great to allow of more than a passing irritation .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 14]: She stretched out her hand , and gripped her sister by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 3]: `` Mary !
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 4]: you are horrid .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 26]: Not one single nice word yet , not one congratulation , when I came in at once to tell you before anyone in the world !
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 34]: If it had been mother , she 'd have been hanging round my neck in hysterics of excitement , but you do nothing but lie there and croak , and throw cold water .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 20]: I 'm your own sister -- does it seem so extraordinary that a man should want to marry me ?
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 7]: Mary , be _ nice _ !
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 3]: Congratulate me !
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 25]: Wo n't you be glad to have a married sister , and all the fun and excitement of a wedding in the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 4]: `` Fun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 7]: echoed Mary , and shuddered eloquently .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 24]: In imagination she saw her mother collecting store catalogues , comparing prices to the fraction of a penny , and dictating innumerable notes .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 60]: In imagination she saw herself spending week after week eternally sewing for Teresa , marking for Teresa , running ribbons through Teresa 's _ lingerie _ , unpacking Teresa 's presents , packing Teresa 's boxes , tidying , arranging , slaving for Teresa , while Teresa herself paid calls , and sat with her lover in the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 30]: All these things she would do when the time came , and do them meekly and well , but in the doing there would be no `` fun . ''
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 28]: There was no lightsomeness of spirit in the Mallison household to ease the strain of small duties , or turn a _ contretemps _ into a joke .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 58]: Mrs Mallison 's heart would swell with pride at the prospect of providing an outfit for the future Mrs Dane Peignton ; she would say and believe that the whole responsibility was borne on her shoulders ; nevertheless , the preparation of that outfit would add years to the lives of every human creature beneath her roof .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 22]: `` I ca n't say that I look forward to the wedding itself , but I hope you will be happy .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 12]: It would be nice for one of us to be happy .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 16]: Captain Peignton is a good man ; I hope he will be happy too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 13]: Mary hesitated , and a pathetic curiosity showed itself in her face .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 13]: `` I suppose you could n't tell me what he said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 5]: Teresa shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 7]: `` Of _ course not _ !
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 5]: ... Very little really .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 6]: It was in the car .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 8]: The man ran us into the ditch .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 16]: I was frightened , and ... and then , of course -- he comforted me !
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 12]: We got home so quickly that there was not much time .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 8]: -- He is coming to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 11]: Mary nodded , a light of comprehension brightening her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 9]: `` You are quite sure he meant it ?
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 20]: You are always so sure that you are right , and that everything ought to go as you wish .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 10]: Do n't be too sure of him , Teresa !
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 13]: Even if you are properly engaged , do n't be too sure .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 29]: He has only met you now and again for an hour at a time , and seen that you were young and pretty , and good at games .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 7]: Now he will see you often .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 10]: He may be disappointed and change his mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 11]: `` Am I so much worse than I appear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 8]: `` I did n't mean worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 9]: `` Then what _ did _ you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 5]: Not better , evidently .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 15]: What do you expect him to find out when he knows me better ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 7]: There 's nothing to find . ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 18]: Teresa rose with an elaborate flutter of garments , and stood tall and straight by the bedside .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 6]: `` I 'd better go .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 12]: It is evidently not the slightest use talking to you to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 10]: I think you have been very unsisterly and disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 8]: I wish I had never come in .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 15]: I was so happy , and you have done nothing but throw cold water .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 13]: Are you jealous , Mary , that you are so unkind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 8]: Mary gave her back look for look .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 9]: A dull flush showed itself on her cheek-bones .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 12]: `` Would it be such a wonderful thing if I were ?
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 12]: I _ am _ jealous ; of course I am jealous .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 8]: I have every reason to be jealous .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 11]: You get everything , Teresa ; and I get nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 13]: It has always been like that , and it always will be .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 27]: You are strong , and I am weak ; you are pretty , and I am plain ; you are popular , and I am dull .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 53]: You are masterful , and get your own way , and I am cowardly , and am beaten ; but because one is dull , and cowardly , and plain , it does n't follow that one ca n't feel -- it does n't follow that one ca n't _ ache _ !
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 16]: I have ached for this all my life , and it has come to you .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 16]: No one ever cared for me , but I should have made a good wife .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 12]: I should have loved him more than you will ever love .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 17]: You have wasted so much love on yourself , but I had it all to give .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 19]: I loved a man once , as you love Captain Peignton , but he never thought of me .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 19]: He married a girl with a pretty face , and lived close to us for nearly two years .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 16]: Mother used to invite them here , and send me with messages to the house .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 23]: I could not look out of the window without seeing them together , walking down the street , sitting in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 7]: My bedroom window overlooked their summer-house .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 12]: I used to see him come in and kiss her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 3]: Teresa shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 7]: `` I should have gone mad !
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 4]: Poor old Mary !
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 7]: But why did you stand it ?
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 11]: I should have gone away , and done something . ''
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 8]: Mary asked , and Teresa was silent .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 13]: Mary had a way of asking questions which were impossible to answer .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 7]: What _ could _ Mary do ?
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 27]: She was one of the vast army of middle-class daughters brought up to do nothing , and thereby as hopelessly imprisoned as any slave of old .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 41]: She possessed no natural gifts nor accomplishments , she lacked the training which would have ensured excellence in any one department of domestic work , she was devoid of a personality which would make her mere companionship of marketable value .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 16]: What could Mary do , and who would care to engage Mary to do it ?
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 8]: Teresa was silent , finding no reply .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 11]: She stood hesitating by the bedside , sympathetic but impatient .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 18]: She was sorry ; of course she was sorry , but to-night she wanted to be glad .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 13]: It would have been better to have gone straight to her room .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 21]: `` I could n't go away , '' Mary continued slowly , `` but they went -- after two years !
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 24]: I fought so hard to deaden myself that I might not feel , that I seem to have been half dead ever since .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 8]: It 's eight years since they left .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 7]: I do n't love him now .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 21]: I do n't think of him for months at a time ; but that was my love affair , Teresa .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 6]: There was never anyone else .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 17]: There never will be now , and life goes on just the same year after year .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 20]: It 's wicked , I suppose , but I wonder sometimes why women like me were ever born . ''
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 8]: `` Mary , you are very useful .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 11]: You work so hard -- you are always working . ''
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 5]: `` Little things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 5]: said Mary , sighing .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 4]: `` Little things !
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 5]: Things with my hands .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 11]: But a woman is not _ all _ hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 14]: She hitched the blankets once more , and lay back on the pillow .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 8]: `` You 'd better go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 6]: It 's getting late . ''
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 10]: `` Good night , Mary ; good old Mary !
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 22]: You shall come and stay with me in my house , and I 'll give you a real good time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 10]: Teresa turned away , eager to make her escape .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 41]: She did not kiss her sister , for kisses were not frequent in the Mallison family , and the sudden unlocking of Mary 's sealed lips left an effect of strangeness , as if some stranger had taken her place .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 14]: It was disturbing and disagreeable to realise that Mary could _ feel _ !
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 21]: She opened the door softly and was stepping over the threshold when Mary 's voice called in an urgent note .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 5]: `` More confidences ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 11]: sighed Teresa to herself , and stood still to listen .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 12]: `` Did you remember to turn out the hall light ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 3]: asked Mary .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 3]: CHAPTER TEN .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 4]: NEWS IN CHUMLEY .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 23]: The news of Teresa Mallison 's engagement provided Chumley with an excitement which was shared equally by every section of the community .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 45]: Tradesmen discussed it with their assistants , message boys overheard , and took it home in the dinner hour , as an important item of news which mother would be able to bestow on other members of the Coal Club and Mothers ' Meeting .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 15]: `` That fair girl of Mallison 's , she hooked him up at Bagnor !
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 5]: Peignton they call him .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 8]: Fair chap as drives a dog-cart . ''
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 28]: Domestic servants discussed the engagement with the maids next door , and opined that the old Major would be glad to get rid of one of them .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 47]: Wherever a couple of matrons stood together on the pavement of the High Street , or a cluster of girls stood holding bicycles in the roadway itself , it would have been safe to bet that the subject of discussion was that of the latest engagement .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 8]: `` Have you heard the news ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 5]: `` What news ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 4]: `` Teresa Mallison .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 5]: You have n't heard ?
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 15]: Oh , I _ am glad _ to be the one to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 3]: Engaged ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 35]: The speaker 's voice would swell to a note of triumph , she would fall back a step the better to contemplate the surprise , the excitement , on the face of the listener .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 3]: `` Engaged !
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 2]: Teresa ?
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 8]: _ Not _ -- '' `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 3]: Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 11]: Here the informant would execute a little prance of excitement .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 8]: `` It is , '' Captain Peignton .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 7]: _ Is n't _ it exciting ?
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 7]: The most interesting engagement for years .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 5]: Mrs Mallison is beaming .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 20]: The listener would enthuse in her turn , sometimes wholeheartedly , sometimes with an undercurrent of sadness or regret .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 53]: Mothers of aging daughters knew a vicarious pang , the daughters themselves smiled brilliantly and ached within , but the general note was praise of Teresa , pride in Teresa , an assumption that Teresa had accomplished a laudable work , and had raised herself a head and shoulders above her fellows .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 27]: Such is the general opinion in English country towns , where the educated females of the population exceed the male by a round ten to one .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 14]: As for Dane himself , he was the passive member in the transaction .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 7]: He had been `` caught . ''
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 7]: Teresa had `` caught '' him .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 17]: It was said in no spirit of unkindness , but it was said all the same .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 20]: Every voice said it , every smile , every nod of the head and knowing arch of the brow .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 3]: Clever Teresa .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 7]: The best match in the town !
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 20]: Grizel , like most other matrons , heard the news outside the grocer 's shop in the High Street .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 49]: The night before Martin had sighed over the grocer 's bill , and that sigh had sent his wife speeding out of the house by eleven o'clock the next morning , fired with determination to become a model housekeeper forthwith , and deliver her own orders in person .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 32]: Interviewed before starting , Cook acknowledged that Robson 's _ was _ high , but had no further explanation to offer than that `` it _ did _ run up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 32]: The young man called every morning , and there was always `` Something , '' but Chumley matrons had repeatedly warned Grizel that that young man should _ not _ call .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 13]: It was death and destruction to let cooks order at the door .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 15]: Orders should be given in the shop , and delivered later in the van .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 9]: Grizel had hesitated , and advanced a counter-plea .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 16]: `` But the van-man is quite old , and Orders is such an attractive youth .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 8]: It 's hard on poor Cook ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 33]: But now Martin had frowned , and the lines had showed in his forehead , and she could have found it in her heart to imprison Cook in a nunnery for life .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 44]: Mr Robson , senior , hurried forward to attend in person to a customer of distinction , and took advantage of the occasion to direct her attention to a number of new and delectable goods , positively the latest things on the market .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 38]: Fruits preserved whole , and so cleverly as to be hardly distinguishable from fresh ; glass shapes of rare and costly edibles , all ready for the table ; sauces , condiments , appetising novelties in biscuits .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 26]: Grizel displayed the liveliest interest , tasted , with relish , whenever a taste was practicable , and ordered half-dozens of each novelty in turn .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 24]: Mr Robson pointed out that there was a reduction upon taking half a dozen , and Grizel had set her heart on reduction .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 40]: The size of the bill gave her a disagreeable shock , however , and she left the shop feeling decidedly crestfallen , to fall into the arms of Mrs Gardiner and Mrs Evans , who were standing just outside .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 47]: The sight of Mrs Beverley emerging from a provision store , like any ordinary prosaic housekeeper , was surprising enough to put the subject of the latest engagement into the background while the good ladies greeted her , and stealthily examined the details of her toilette .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 7]: `` Good morning , Mrs Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 11]: It is a surprise to see _ you _ here !
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 8]: No need to ask how you are .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 9]: -- You look the picture of health . ''
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 6]: `` I 'm not really .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 7]: I 'm bowed low with care .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 13]: My domestic troubles are like my wedding presents , numerous and costly .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 8]: The worst of all is the grocer .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 12]: I never knew that a grocer 's shop was so alluring !
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 29]: I thought it was all teas and pickles , and dull things for cleaning that one ca n't eat , but it 's a fiery furnace of temptation .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 23]: I 've been in ten minutes and I 've spent pounds ... And I came myself because I wanted to save ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 10]: The matrons ' smile bore a touch of pathos .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 18]: They themselves had suffered from grocers ' bills for many years , and knew the inevitableness thereof .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 32]: Every woman who is at the head of a household must shoulder the burden of the grocer 's bill , and bear it bravely , for it is hers for life .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 37]: Assiduous , unceasing care may at times relieve the pressure , but there can be no escape ; the smallest slackening of care , and the burden presses once again , weighing her to the earth .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 41]: On almost any other subject the listeners would have been ready to converse with the interesting bride , but when it came to a choice between grocer 's bills and a new engagement , the engagement won at a canter .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 12]: `` We were just discussing an exciting piece of news ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 6]: Mrs Gardiner said , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 9]: `` You have heard already , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 7]: Everybody is talking about it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 11]: Grizel 's face brightened instantly into the most agreeable animation .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 9]: Tell me ... _ What _ is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 10]: Somebody run away with somebody else 's wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 5]: `` My dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 5]: Mrs Evans frowned disapproval .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 6]: `` This is not London .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 12]: I am thankful to say we do n't do such things .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 13]: We were speaking of an engagement in which we are much interested .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 8]: You know the girl , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 3]: Teresa Mallison .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 11]: We are so pleased to know of her happiness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 11]: `` So am I. I love girls to be happy .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 19]: I 'd like them all to be engaged and married to-morrow to husbands nearly as nice as mine .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 15]: And she has such a ripping complexion ... Who is the happy man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 6]: This was the thrilling point .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 6]: Mrs Gardiner beamed with importance .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 5]: `` Captain Peignton ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 14]: Grizel 's chin dropped ; she stood stock-still , staring with big eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 17]: Why and wherefore she had no idea , but the news was subtly unwelcome and disturbing .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 41]: She had imagined that the _ fiance _ would be the curate , the doctor , the manager of the branch bank -- never for one moment had it entered her mind to think of Dane Peignton filling the role .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 31]: Her mind chronicled a picture of him as she had seen him last , bidding good night to Cassandra Raynor at the conclusion of the dinner party two nights before .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 48]: She had studied him with critical eyes , acknowledging his attractiveness , and -- like others before her -- wondering wherein the attraction lay , but concerning one thing she had known no uncertainty , she had known that he had been bored to leave so early !
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 20]: There had been nothing of the eager lover about him , as he turned with Teresa to the door .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 15]: Grizel felt the flatness of her own voice as she asked : `` When ?
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 3]: How long ?
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 11]: I did n't know ... '' `` Only on Tuesday .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 11]: After the dinner party at the Court , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 5]: He brought her home .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 11]: Of course you were there , and saw them together .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 6]: Did n't you suspect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 4]: `` Never . ''
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 5]: Grizel shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 15]: `` I should not have suspected if I 'd met them a hundred times .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 38]: She is not all the kind of girl I should have expected -- '' Mrs Evans was seized with a small , tickling cough , and Grizel , looking at her , met a glance of warning .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 6]: She hesitated , and compromised .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 9]: `` I hardly know her , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 9]: She must be nice if he likes her .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 7]: He is a charming man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 11]: Mrs Gardiner allowed herself the relief of a phantom sniff .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 11]: Mrs Beverley she considered was putting on `` side . ''
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 31]: She had known Dane and Teresa for precisely the same length of time , yet she spoke of one as a friend , of the other as the merest acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 20]: It was but another example of county _ versus _ town , and as such to be personally resented .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 10]: `` I am very much attached to Teresa Mallison .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 9]: She is a very nice , well-brought-up girl .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 8]: She will make him an excellent wife .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 47]: I think he is very much to be congratulated , '' she said stiffly , and the little speech was memorable , inasmuch as it was the only one delivered in the High Street that day , in which Dane himself was singled out for congratulation !
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 10]: `` Are you walking towards home , Mrs Beverley ?
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 56]: Perhaps we might go so far together , '' said the Vicar 's wife , as Mrs Gardiner nodded adieu , and entered the grocer 's shop , and the two women turned into a side street , composed of those dreary stucco-faced little villas which seem the special abode of insurance agents and dressmakers .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 24]: The houses continued but a short way , and then gave place to nursery gardens , and scattered habitations of a better type .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 39]: Grizel hated the mean little houses , not for any sympathy for the inconvenience which they must cause to their inhabitants , but because she herself was bound to pass them on her way to the High Street .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 43]: She amused herself by planning wholesale fires , in which entire terraces would be devoured , and in a hazy , indefinite fashion had decided that such a catastrophe would be profitable for the insurance agents , as well as for herself .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 21]: Trying for the dressmakers , of course , but then dressmakers spent their lives in being trying to other people .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 6]: Let them take their turn !
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 38]: This morning , however , Grizel was oblivious of the villas , she was peering into Mrs Evans 's large face , and saying tentatively : `` You stopped me ... Why should n't I say it ?
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 26]: If I do n't think Miss Mallison _ is _ the right girl , why may n't I -- '' `` These things get repeated .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 7]: One ca n't be too careful .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 21]: I make it a rule to be silent , if I find myself unable to say what is agreeable . ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 7]: `` How dull you would be !
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 12]: I say _ would _ , because it is n't true .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 15]: You 're scolding me now , and I 'm sure that 's not agreeable !
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 14]: Dear Mrs Evans , do you think it is a suitable engagement ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 10]: `` Dear Mrs Beverley , how can I judge ?
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 16]: Can anyone in the world decide whom a man or a woman will choose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 18]: `` They ca n't , but they can guess pretty well whom they _ wo n't _ !
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 26]: You know them both , Captain Peignton and Miss Mallison ; can you imagine them living together , and being satisfied all their lives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 10]: The older woman looked at the bride in silence .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 44]: Hundreds of couples had she seen kneeling hand in hand in the chancel of the church , cheerfully plighting a troth which bound them together till death should them part , and of how many could it be said that they were satisfied !
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 45]: She knew too well into what a prosaic compromise the lives of many of these lovers degenerated , but she would have felt it a sacrilege to say as much to this bride of the happy eyes , and the gay , unclouded heart .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 24]: `` My dear , '' she said slowly , `` if they think so themselves , it 's not my place to judge .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 21]: It often puzzles one to understand why people choose one another , but I am a strong believer in nature !
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 20]: Nature is always working out her own great plan , and she dictates for the good of the race .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 39]: You see it all around -- the dark chooses the light , the tall chooses the short , the fat chooses the thin , the brilliant woman marries a sportsman , the man of letters a gentle house-frau .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 7]: Nature has dictated in this case .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 22]: Captain Peignton is not too strong , and his nerves have been taxed : Teresa does n't know what nerves are .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 11]: I never knew a more healthy , normal girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 11]: `` Mrs Evans , you have known her for ages .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 10]: Do _ you _ think she is interesting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 14]: But Mrs Evans was not to be trapped into personal expressions of feeling .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 11]: `` It is quite immaterial what _ I _ think .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 25]: I have known Teresa Mallison all her life , but , my dear , I know nothing about the Teresa whom Captain Peignton sees .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 30]: He in his turn knows very little about the Teresa who will be his wife at the end of the first two or three years of married life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 11]: Grizel 's hazel eyes widened with a look of fear .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 9]: `` Does one inevitably change so much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 7]: `` One _ grows _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 4]: Mrs Evans said .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 7]: `` How could it be otherwise ?
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 31]: Marriage for a girl means a shouldering of responsibility for the first time in her life , facing a money strain , a health strain , a curtailment of liberty .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 14]: There is more joy one hopes , but there is certainly more discipline .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 12]: Troubles must come -- '' Grizel threw out a protesting hand .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 26]: Her thoughts had slipped instinctively from the newly engaged couple , to the more enthralling subject of Martin and herself , and the prophecy hurt .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 11]: `` Why must they , if they are n't needed ?
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 15]: Suppose people can be disciplined by happiness , why need they have the trials ?
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 8]: _ I _ am disciplined by happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 9]: It suits me ; it makes me good .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 11]: It does _ not _ make me selfish and unkind .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 7]: And I _ am _ grateful .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 19]: I go about that little house , and there 's something inside me singing ` Thank you ! '
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 5]: ` Thank you ! '
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 4]: all day long .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 36]: I 'm so brimming over with love and charity that it 's all I can do not to kiss the cook on her cross old face , and press a diamond brooch into her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 6]: Anything to make her cheerful !
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 10]: It hurts to see anyone less happy than myself .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 14]: Do n't , please , say I must have trouble , Mrs Evans .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 8]: Let me stay in the sun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 5]: `` Dear child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 22]: said the Vicar 's wife , and once again she felt the unwonted pricking sensation at the back of her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 26]: She was used to sorrow , skilled in offering consolation and advice , but it was all too rare an experience to meet with joy .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 34]: In the depths of her kind old heart she wondered if indeed Grizel were not right , but not for the world would she have allowed herself to express so unorthodox a feeling .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 27]: She walked in silence for some yards , and then , with a sudden change of subject , asked shortly , `` How 's Katrine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 8]: `` Talking of love in the sunshine ?
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 8]: Oh , Katrine 's _ well _ !
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 18]: She 's just returned from her honeymoon , and Captain Blair has had his old bungalow enlarged .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 6]: They had a glorious time .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 18]: She was married from her friend 's house , and rode off to camp in the wilds .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 22]: She shed her skirt as soon as she arrived at the camp , and never saw it again till her return .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 5]: A honeymoon in leggings !
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 8]: What would Chumley say to that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 11]: `` It sounds exceedingly -- er -- unlike Katrine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 7]: `` Yes , does n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 5]: Is n't it splendid ?
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 5]: And she loved it .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 27]: Her only worry was that _ bits _ of her looked so nice , that she was longing all the time to see herself full length .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 14]: -- However , ` _ Jim _ ' has taken her photograph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 9]: `` I hope he will make her happy .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 16]: Katrine has a difficult nature , and it was such a very short acquaintance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 5]: `` Oh , well !
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 11]: but they knew a great deal of each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 26]: Grizel 's smile was enigmatic , for the secret of Katrine Beverley 's correspondence with her unknown lover was not divulged outside the family circle .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 26]: She said good-bye to the Vicar 's wife at the parting of the way , and turned in at the gate of her own domain .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 7]: Daffodils were nodding among the grass .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 32]: A bed beneath the window was ablaze with many-coloured anemones , the shimmer of green was on the trees ; and at the study window stood Martin watching for her return .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 7]: Grizel 's heart swelled within her .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 52]: Despite the enlargement made for her benefit , despite the general air of freshness and prosperity , it was after all but a modest establishment , ludicrously small when contrasted with her former homes , yet for Grizel all the riches and treasures of life were contained within those four walls .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 20]: With the clanging of the gate the world was shut out , and she entered home as a sanctuary .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 33]: Most of us are so occupied regretting past joys , and planning joys for the future , that it is only at rare moments that we realise the joy of the present .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 7]: `` I was so happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 8]: `` I shall be so happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 7]: These are expressions of daily use .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 24]: The sound of `` I _ am _ happy , '' is so rare as to bring with it the effect of shock .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 25]: Grizel was one of the fortunate ones who continually realise the happiness of the present , but even she had her positives and superlatives .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 28]: Since hearing the news of the hour she had been conscious of a weight of depression , but with the opening of the gate that weight disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 28]: It seemed as if no joy that life could have to bestow could exceed that of home-coming , with the sight of Martin waiting for her return !
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 35]: She smiled in answer to his waving hand , but his quick eye caught the sobered expression on her face , and he hurried to meet her , and drew her into the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 9]: `` Anything the matter , my precious one ?
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 5]: Anything troubling you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 21]: Grizel leant her head on his shoulder with a forgetfulness of coiffure which in itself would have raised his apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 15]: Her hands clasped themselves round his arm , she drew a long trembling sigh .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 9]: `` Oh , Martin , hold me close !
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 7]: Do n't let anything happen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 16]: `` What _ has _ happened , dear , to upset you like this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 8]: `` Nothing ; but I 'm afraid .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 27]: Oh , if we are very good , and go on being thankful , and doing our best , need we have troubles to spoil it ?
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 19]: It 's ... it 's _ Paradise _ , Martin , and I want it to last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 9]: Martin 's face quivered above her bowed head .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 13]: He had lived in Paradise before , and it had not lasted .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 35]: He knew that it never did last , that sweet and dear as might be the after life , it was only for a brief period that human beings could remain in their Eden .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 10]: He held her close , with a jealous touch .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 15]: `` So long as we have each other , we can bear the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 28]: Honestly , dear , we shall have less to bear than most people , for the simple reason that we wo n't _ let _ things trouble !
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 14]: When one has gained the big treasure , the gnats ca n't sting .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 13]: It 's not like you , Grizel , to be afraid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 12]: `` I am hideously afraid , but it 's your fault .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 14]: It 's loving you so much that has turned me into a coward .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 35]: I 'm afraid of everything where you are concerned , -- draughts and drains , and accidents , and editors , and letters in blue envelopes , and perils by night and by day .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 10]: Every day I bury you of a new disease .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 24]: If you sneeze it 's consumption , if you cough it 's pneumonia , if you scratch your finger , it 's blood-poisoning .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 13]: You looked pale this morning , so it was pernicious anaemia . ''
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 21]: A little laugh came with the last words , and she raised her head to peer into his face . ''
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 16]: _ Do _ you feel by any chance as if you had pernicious anaemia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 13]: Martin took her by the shoulders and led her to the door .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 15]: `` I shall do , if you keep me waiting any longer for lunch .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 9]: Go upstairs and take off your hat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 7]: But Grizel lingered by the door .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 7]: `` Do you about me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 8]: `` Do I what about you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 11]: `` Think of all the gruesome things that might happen ?
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 7]: Lie awake at night imagining them .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 14]: -- Get in a panic every time I am five minutes late ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 15]: `` You were over five minutes late to-day , but my pulse was normal .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 16]: I merely concluded that you had met a friend and were enjoying a gossip . ''
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 18]: `` Men , '' said Grizel sententiously , `` are stupid , dense , prosaic brutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 32]: She gave a tilt to her one-sided hat , and added in a tone of the utmost nonchalance : `` By the way , I _ did _ hear some gossip .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 17]: Captain Peignton is engaged to that fair girl he took in to dinner at the Court .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 8]: Teresa -- do n't you call her ?
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 5]: -- Teresa Mallison . ''
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 7]: `` By Jove , is he ?
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 7]: That _ is _ good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 3]: Martin said .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 9]: `` I 'm awfully pleased to hear that .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 8]: They 'll make an ideal pair . ''
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 12]: Grizel glared at him , with the eyes of a fury .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 9]: `` Oh , go to your study ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 4]: she cried vindictively .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 11]: `` Go to your study -- and write books ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 3]: CHAPTER ELEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 4]: THE VEIL FALLS .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 26]: The Squire heard the news of Peignton 's engagement at the County Club , and carried it to his wife on his return to lunch .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 23]: He found Cassandra on the terrace , where she had spent what was perhaps one of the happiest hours of her life .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 35]: An hour before she had opened one of the long windows of the morning room , and had stepped bareheaded , in her white morning dress , into a bath of sunshine and warmth .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 57]: Hitherto though the sun had shone , east winds had prevailed -- making it necessary to put on wrappings for even the shortest excursion , but this morning the `` nip '' had departed ; what wind there was blew balmily from the south , and the temperature without was warmer than that in the house .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 59]: There is always a special thrill attendant on the first breath of summer , a special consciousness of freedom and escape , when for the first time it becomes possible to leave the house and wander bareheaded under the skies , but never , as it seemed to Cassandra , had a springtide been so wonderful as this .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 15]: She looked downwards over the terraced gardens , and everywhere the world seemed new .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 36]: Green branches on the larches , shimmers of green on oak and ash , swelling of buds on the great chestnuts , and through the bare brown of the earth the shooting of living things .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 22]: Everything was new and pregnant with joys to come , and from her own heart came an answering song of joy .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 33]: It seemed in mysterious fashion as though the stateness of custom had been left behind , with other drearinesses of the long winter , and the coming spring had vivified her life .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 43]: The air breathed hope and expectation , and although she could not have said to what special event she was looking forward , she knew that there was hope in her heart also , and an expectation which gilded the coming days .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 59]: It was good to be alive , to wander bareheaded in the sunshine inhaling the fragrance of flowers , to behold reflected in the long windows the graceful glimpses of one 's own form , to look around the fair domain lying to right and left , and be able to say , `` This is mine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 28]: Cassandra clasped her hands behind her back and strolled to and fro , thinking the many and inconsequent thoughts that come to a woman in such hours .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 19]: She wondered why she had ever been unhappy , and decided never again to `` give way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 18]: She wondered what Bernard had really felt when she had declared that she did not love him .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 3]: Poor Bernard !
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 8]: How could she have been so bold ?
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 6]: Of course she loved him !
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 7]: He was a nice old dear .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 16]: She wondered if , after all , the new afternoon dress had better be grey !
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 21]: Suppose it were violet for a change ; just the right shade of violet , without a touch of red .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 27]: She wondered if she dare wear the new French hat in Chumley , and what the boy would say of it when he came from school .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 20]: He had a way of calling her hats `` the Limit , '' and looking self-conscious in their presence .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 52]: She had laughed , and worn them all the same , for the wearing of the latest eccentricity in hats had been something more than a slavish following of fashion , -- it had been a virtual throwing down of the gage in the face of the prejudices of the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 55]: On the days when she was most oppressed by the atmosphere of Chumley and its inhabitants , it had a tonic effect to drive up and down the High Street , wearing a feather stuck at an angle never before attempted out of Paris , and to watch eyes roll from right to left .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 14]: There had been a time when the church aisle was her chosen shocking-ground .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 18]: Cassandra blushed when she recalled that phase , and remembered what had brought it to an end .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 9]: Just an expression on Mrs Evans 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 3]: Nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 78]: She had paused outside the church gate to speak a passing word before getting into the car , and the Vicar 's wife had been kindly and affectionate as ever , had called her `` Dear , '' and held her hand in a lengthened pressure , but there had been a shadow upon the large , plain face , and the grey eyes were rigorously averted from the marvellous headpiece topping the small , brilliant face .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 46]: The silence , the kindliness , made Cassandra feel suddenly mean and small , a sensation which was intensified as the car turned from the church door , and Bernard had said with a laugh : `` Give 'em a treat this time , Cass !
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 15]: That hat of yours took the starch out of the Vicar 's sermon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 20]: An hour later the hat was a smouldering ruin , and henceforth Cassandra took her plainest clothes to church .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 13]: But the High Street remained , and here no one could interfere .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 28]: As the wife of the squire and landlord she might indeed be said to have the right to shock , when it pleased her so to do .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 17]: Now that the bulbs were in bloom Bernard would agitate for the usual spring garden party .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 27]: He always asked the same question : `` What was the use of having the things at all , if nobody came to see them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 41]: So the entire neighbourhood was invited , and frequently it rained , inevitably the wind blew from the east , and the guests made scant work of the bulbs , and huddled in the house , partaking of lengthy teas .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 22]: Cassandra hated all garden parties , and spring parties most of all , but this morning the prospect seemed less distasteful .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 28]: She would no longer know the feeling of loneliness in a crowd , she would have friends of her own , whose presence would transform the scene .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 56]: In imagination she summoned them before her -- Grizel , with her radiant smile , and merry , chattering tongue ; Peignton , his head bending forward from the slightly bowed back , his eyes fixed upon her , with their questioning look , the look that said so plainly : `` I am waiting .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 10]: Give me your orders , and I obey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 18]: Some men had that expression ; it meant nothing , of course , but it had charm .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 5]: Decidedly it had charm .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 19]: It would help her through the formalities of entertaining , to feel in the distance that waiting glance .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 14]: Cassandra turned and saw her husband ascending the stone steps of the terrace .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 18]: He had entered the grounds by a side gate , and made his way across the path .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 26]: His cap was pushed back from his brow , his brown face showed the flush of heat , his eyes looked astonishingly blue and clear .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 46]: There was a metallic quality about those eyes which , taken in conjunction with the strong white teeth , gave a somewhat fierce expression to the face , but to-day he was smiling , and an air of complaisance and satisfaction pervaded the whole figure .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 5]: Cassandra smiled in response .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 10]: It seemed fitting that to-day everyone should feel happy .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 14]: She stood waiting for his approach , and together they paced slowly onward .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 6]: `` Is n't it lovely ?
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 8]: I 've been out over an hour .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 6]: A perfect spring day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 7]: `` Mating time , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 8]: said the Squire with a laugh . ''
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 13]: ` In the Spring a young man 's fancy ... ' Well !
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 6]: it seems it is true .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 7]: I 've just been hearing news .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 5]: You have n't heard ?
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 10]: I thought perhaps they would ring you up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 8]: `` No , '' said Cassandra blankly .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 27]: She stared uncomprehendingly in her husband 's face , and suddenly her heart gave a queer unexpected little thud , and her pulses quickened their beat .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 11]: `` Who did you expect would ring me up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 7]: `` Oh , either of them .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 3]: Or both .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 15]: They 're at the stage when they 'll want to do everything in pairs .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 9]: And they know you 'll be interested . ''
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 14]: `` Could n't you tell me at once what the news is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 8]: `` I _ did _ tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 6]: An engagement , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 4]: Peignton 's engagement .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 5]: With the fair Teresa .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 14]: For goodness ' sake , do n't pretend to be surprised to hear .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 12]: You notice precious little , but you must have noticed that .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 10]: I told you myself it was coming on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 6]: `` Of course you did .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 4]: I remember perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 16]: I am very -- '' Cassandra paused from sheer inability to think what feeling dominated .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 30]: She felt neither glad nor sorry , interested nor surprised ; nothing but a curious blankness , as if a veil had been dropped over the scene of life .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 30]: Five minutes ago , two minutes ago , she had been tingling with vitality , now she was numb , and found it an effort to collect her thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 11]: For once Bernard 's lack of observation was a gain .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 20]: He strode along the terrace with hands thrust into his pockets , smiling in agreeable reminiscence of club-room gossip .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 14]: `` Rather a stiff thing in mothers-in-law , -- Mrs Mallison , what ?
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 7]: Do n't envy him the connection .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 12]: Best thing he can do to cut away to a distance .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 7]: But the girl 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 4]: Fine buxom creature .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 8]: Got her head screwed on all right .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 6]: Just the wife he needs .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 31]: Nice fellow , but inclined to be fanciful , -- the sort of man one could imagine taking up any mad scheme , if he were left on his own .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 7]: Miss Teresa will stop that nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 12]: She 's got a partic-u-larly keen look out for number one .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 7]: Ought to have fine children too .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 16]: Just the type to go in for an annual baby without turning a hair . ''
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 6]: Cassandra 's look was frigid .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 8]: `` I think we may leave that .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 22]: It is hardly the time -- '' `` Lord bless my soul , what else is she _ for _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 5]: cried the Squire loudly .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 13]: `` What is any woman for , if it comes to that ?
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 17]: If more of them did it , there would be less talk of nerves and nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 21]: The modern woman is too careful of herself to be burdened with a family , and what 's the consequence ?
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 8]: I ask you what 's the consequence ?
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 10]: Are they any healthier than their mothers before them ?
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 5]: Are they as healthy ?
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 18]: Damned sight more satisfactory work looking after a nursery , than gambling in bridge clubs every afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 13]: Too squeamish nowadays even to talk of 'em , it appears ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 22]: Through the roughness of the man 's voice there sounded a note of pain which pierced through the wife 's torpor .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 22]: He would have liked a nursery full of his own , and had grieved over the fate which made it impossible .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 27]: Cassandra knew it , and admired the reticence with which he kept his disappointment to himself , never allowing it to escape in so many words .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 12]: She was the more remorseful as the disappointment was not mutual .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 34]: She had hoped so much , given so much for her son , had suffered so bitter a disappointment from his lack of response , that she had no wish for another child .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 7]: But she was sorry for Bernard .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 19]: She stretched out her hand and put it through his arm , leaning against him with unusual intimacy .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 14]: `` Do n't shout at me , Bernard ; do n't be cross !
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 4]: Why should you ?
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 16]: I daresay it 's all quite true , but children do n't always bring happiness .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 11]: Think of the parents you know who have large families !
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 6]: They are always in trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 76]: Some of the brood are always miserable , or ill , or in difficulties , or poor , or unruly , or all at once , and the poor parents have to rack their brains to think how they can help , and suffer every pang with them ; _ worse _ pangs , because the children are young , and can shake things off , and the parents sit by the fire and think .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 9]: I 've seen it with my own parents .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 11]: They never had a chance of being happy and restful .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 12]: One or other of us was always tearing their heart-strings . ''
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 22]: `` People do n't have children for the sake of happiness , my good girl , '' the Squire said bluntly .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 21]: `` A certain amount of happiness goes to it , no doubt , but that 's not the principal consideration .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 23]: It 's a duty they owe to the race , and they must be prepared to take the rough with the smooth .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 13]: You ca n't expect to rear any young thing without trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 13]: `` But they do n't _ care _ in return , Bernard !
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 5]: They care so little .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 5]: That 's the heart-break .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 13]: Parents are everlastingly giving out , and getting so little in return .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 6]: It 's an empty feeling .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 17]: Children give so little , in comparison with the love that is lavished on them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 8]: `` Who expects them to care ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 4]: demanded the Squire .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 23]: `` It 's nature that the old should look after the young ; it 's nature that the young should fly away .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 8]: It 's no use bucking against nature !
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 25]: You are thinking of your own satisfaction , and the amount of happiness _ you _ are going to get out of the business .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 7]: That 's where you 're wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 10]: There 's too much talk of happiness these days .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 7]: I do n't believe in it .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 7]: It makes people soft and finicking .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 25]: If they thought less about their feelings , and more about their work , it would be a damned sight better for all concerned .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 12]: We were not put into this world to be happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 12]: `` Were n't we , Bernard , were n't we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 4]: Cassandra asked piteously .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 47]: Five minutes ago it had seemed that happiness was the be-all and end-all of life , that in fact it was life itself , the only thing worthy of the name , but that was five minutes ago , and since then the veil had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 20]: Pacing the terrace by Bernard 's side , the hard theory of work and duty seemed infinitely more applicable .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 8]: And yet -- life was so long !
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 12]: Barely thirty years behind and perhaps forty or more to come .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 8]: Cassandra 's heart shrank at the prospect .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 22]: She could have faced death bravely , but life appalled ; long , dragging-out years of duty , unillumined by love .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 28]: If it were hard now in the days of youth , and health , and beauty , what would it be in the searing of the leaf ?
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 32]: She looked into her husband 's face , so strong and wholesome in its clear , out-of-door tints , and her heart went out to him in a wave of longing .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 33]: As a drowning man will cling to the first support that his arms can reach , so did she turn to the man who had vowed to give her a lifelong support .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 5]: If Bernard would care !
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 12]: If just for once he would show that he could care .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 8]: Her starving heart cried out for food .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 15]: It seemed impossible to live on , without a word of love or appreciation .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 18]: She pushed her hand further through his arm , and gently smoothed the sleeve of his coat .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 38]: It lay just beneath his eyes , the long , beautiful hand , the tapering fingers delicately white , with a tinge of pink on the almond-shaped nails ; the square-cut emerald sent out gleams of light .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 10]: Cassandra knew that that hand was a lovely thing .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 21]: Surely the sight of it , resting there , would bring that other strong , brown hand to meet it !
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 20]: Then , grasping it fast , she could speak out , and say : `` Help me , Bernard .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 5]: Show me your love !
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 20]: I am only a woman , and I am afraid ... '' But the strong hand did not come .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 11]: Bernard slackened his arm , and turned towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 31]: His ear had caught the tremor in his wife 's voice , and it was his fixed decision that when women waxed emotional it was wisdom to leave them alone .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 23]: He looked at his watch , announced that there was just time for a wash before lunch , and took his departure .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 10]: And as he went he whistled a lively song .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 15]: Cassandra leant her arms on the stone balustrade and looked over the sloping gardens .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 19]: The shimmer of green buds was on the trees ; through the brown earth were springing living things .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 15]: All the world was new , but in her breast her heart lay dead .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWELVE .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 4]: HER INFINITE VARIETY .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 48]: `` I should like , '' announced Grizel to Martin over the breakfast table , `` I should like to publish an apology , illuminated and framed , dedicated to middle-class house-mistresses , to explain how I 'd misjudged 'em , and say I 'm sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 19]: `` Now that , in a manner of speaking , you have become one of them yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 16]: `` I do n't know what you mean by ` a manner of speaking . '
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 8]: I _ have _ , wuss luck !
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 5]: so now I know .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 28]: I always laughed before , and felt superior and forbearing , and wondered why he married her , and felt so sorry for him that he had .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 18]: One of the many aggravating things about a man is that he looks so much nicer middle-aged .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 36]: He is scraggy when he is young , but he fills out , and grows broad and dignified , and the little touch of grey in his hair has quite a _ poudree _ effect .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 7]: But his wife does not improve .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 23]: Take 'em fat , or take 'em thin , there 's no getting away from it , they look worse every year .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 29]: It needs a lot of grace , Martin , for a woman , to watch herself growing steadily into a fright , and to keep on smiling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 20]: `` Every woman , my vain one , is not so much occupied with her appearance as you are .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 11]: When she gets middle-aged , she does n't care . ''
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 17]: `` Then she ought to , or her last estate will be worse than the first .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 11]: Her husband and children will rise up and rend her .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 50]: Her boys will blush for her when she goes to their public school ; and her girls will have engagements when she wants to go out , and her husband will think thoughts , and look back and wonder ` _ Why _ ' -- '' `` Not necessarily .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 5]: It does n't follow .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 35]: I was at a musical At Home one evening last year , when a professional sang , ` Believe me if all those endearing young charms ' -- You know how it goes on !
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 41]: -- ` were to fade by to-morrow , etc. , thou wouldst still be beloved , as this moment thou art , and around the dear ruins , each wish of my heart , would entwine itself faithfully still . '
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 12]: The hostess seized that moment to sail out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 6]: She was a vast woman .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 16]: Parts of her were engulfed by the doorway long before her head vanished from sight .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 23]: She had numerous chins , but , imbedded in flesh , one could still trace a likeness to an ethereally fair daughter .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 15]: The host took me by the arm , and pointed covertly to the door .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 8]: ` _ My dear Ruins _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 6]: he whispered beneath his breath .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 8]: ` _ My dear Ruins _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 13]: But there was love in his eyes , as well as fun .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 6]: He loved his Ruins ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 5]: `` Bless him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 4]: cried Grizel warmly .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 6]: `` May his tribe increase !
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 6]: But most men do n't .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 7]: So she must do her best .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 29]: If she 's fat , she diets , and it 's harder for a middle-class housewife to diet than for any creature on the face of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 3]: Because why ?
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 63]: She has to rack her brains every morning to think of nice things for other people to eat , and naturally she thinks of the things she likes best herself , and then she sallies forth and buys them , and smells the smell of their seasoning all afternoon , and at the great moment says , ` No thank you ! '
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 5]: and eats minced beef .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 43]: And when the poor dear catches hold of an infinitesimal crinkle in her gown , and calls upon those present to witness that she grows so thin that it hangs upon her , -- they jeer , and laugh her to scorn .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 5]: I 've heard it .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 5]: I 've seen it .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 7]: It 's a heartrending sight . ''
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 14]: `` I 'll promise faithfully not to jeer when you grow fat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 10]: `` I never shall , '' Grizel assured him .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 6]: `` Scrags are my line .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 8]: Scrags are much easier to deal with .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 23]: Scrags can always be mitigated if you lavish enough money ; it 's the plain coat and skirt that 's the devil .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 20]: I 'd like to found a charity for the supply of draped garments to the thin wives of clergymen .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 23]: _ Ca n't _ you see them , -- in navy-blue serge , with flannel shirts falling well in at the chest ?
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 10]: It must have a depressing effect on the sermons !
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 8]: ... What was I talking of last !
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 9]: It 's rather difficult to keep count . ''
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 10]: `` The superiority of middle-aged men over their wives .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 6]: Was n't that it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 8]: `` I never said they were superior .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 19]: They 're not , but they look it , and that 's an extra burden on the wives .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 18]: It proves without any doubt soever that women 's work is more exhausting than men 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 13]: `` Is this by any chance a suffragette lecture in disguise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 4]: `` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 4]: Who mentioned suffragettes ?
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 46]: I 'm talking of the old-fashioned women who stay at home , and look after their own affairs , and I 'm sorry for them , and wonder they are not fifty times more stupid than they are , and I 'm sorry I spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 17]: I said in my haste , ` They can talk of nothing but their servants . '
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 3]: Poor darlings !
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 3]: What wonder ?
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 28]: Shut in from morning till night with two aproned fiends , who at any moment may reduce you to starvation , or poison you as you eat .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 13]: -LRB- I do n't care if my pronouns _ are _ mixed !
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 9]: I shall mix them if I like ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 54]: Suppose man had to live day and night mewed up with his clerk and office boy ; suppose _ you _ were followed wherever you went by grumbles and breakages , and a smell of onions , and dare n't let go , in case you were left to clean the sink yourself !
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 39]: A woman said to me the other day , that after a lifelong struggle she could not for the life of her decide which was worse -- a servant who thinks , or a servant who do n't .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 7]: Her housemaid _ could _ think .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 31]: She thought the laundry bill had been rather high the last few weeks , so she kept back a lot of table-linen what time a party of guests were expected .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 16]: She was hurt about it when reproved , and said she could never do right .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 6]: She could n't ... Martin !
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 7]: make up my mind for me .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 10]: -- Should I give Parsons notice or not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 16]: Martin elevated his eyebrows , and nodded once or twice with an air of enlightenment .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 3]: `` Ah-ha !
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 6]: Now we come to it !
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 8]: I was waiting for the personal application .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 4]: Parsons , eh !
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 6]: Let me hear the case .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 5]: Yours and Parsons 's .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 6]: Then I can judge . ''
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 19]: Grizel rested both elbows on the table , and supported her chin in the hollow of her hands .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 8]: `` Parsons , '' she said clearly .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 7]: `` Maud Emily , age twenty-six .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 4]: Profession , House-parlourmaid .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 21]: Religion , Anabaptist -LRB- I 'm sure she 's an Anabaptist , by the cut of her Sunday hat -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 2]: Honest .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 2]: Steady .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 7]: Clean in her work and person .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 4]: Willing and obliging .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 7]: Can clean plate ... Forgets everything .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 4]: Breaks the rest .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 4]: Snores while waiting .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 29]: Has feelings , and an invalid mamma , who , I feel it in my bones , will be tuk worse regularly on the afternoons of dinner parties .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 16]: In every emergency , can be backed to do the worst possible thing ... There !
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 9]: it 's a problem for a society paper !
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 10]: ... _ What should Mrs Beverley do _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 9]: `` Mrs Beverley should exercise patience and self-control .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 17]: She should speak gently to the poor girl , who no doubt is doing her best .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 24]: First Prize awarded for this solution , a copy of Mrs Tupper 's famous work , _ The Blue Boy Darling _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 5]: Grizel contemplated him frowningly .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 11]: `` Something will have to be done about your jokes !
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 7]: You have no sense of fitness .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 13]: It drives me daft when a person jokes when I am worried .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 42]: I 'll laugh myself in a fortnight 's time ; with grace I 'll laugh to-morrow , but I wo n't laugh to-day for all the jokes on earth , and I hate anyone who tries to make me do it .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 20]: I 'm not in the mood for jokes , and you ought to know it without being told . ''
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 14]: `` Sorry , Madam , but there seems something wrong with your theory .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 25]: You want to be cheered when you are already cheered , and not to be cheered when you are in need of cheering . ''
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 14]: `` Silly jokes , '' Grizel said firmly , `` do not cheer .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 9]: They can be endured in periods of health .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 17]: In periods of affliction they are the last straw which breaks the woman 's back . ''
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 26]: Martin chewed his bacon in dignified silence , while his wife cocked a speculative eye at him to see if she had gone too far .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 58]: Presently the two pairs of eyes met , and Grizel , made an extraordinary play with her eyebrows which gave the effect of contrition , and defiance , and injured innocence , and apologetic love , and half a dozen appealing sentiments rolled into one , whereat Martin shrugged , and cried , `` You women ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 12]: and racked his brain to think what consolation to offer next .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 14]: `` Cheer up , darling , we 'll have a holiday next month .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 24]: I 've had a note from the agent to say we can have the house , and the Squire is keen to join .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 34]: You 'll enjoy the sea and unlimited powwows with Lady Cassandra , and , if you speak her fair , perhaps she 'll take over the housekeeping , and set you free . ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 36]: The mutual renting of a house near a seaside golf course had been in discussion for some time between the two households , but Grizel betrayed only a mitigated satisfaction in her husband 's proposal .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 32]: `` Cassandra knows nothing about housekeeping , and if she did I 'm not going to give it up , just as there 's a chance of getting a little credit .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 10]: I 'm getting quite a daisy at it now .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 9]: Guess what you 're going to have to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 8]: _ Best end of the neck _ !
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 15]: Cook suggested it , and I said , ` _ Whose _ neck ? '
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 5]: She looked quite scared .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 13]: Martin , did you know you had chops growing inside your neck ?
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 5]: Is n't it thrilling ?
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 16]: ... I 'm going to kiss you on the best end of your neck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 23]: She rose , and put her threat into execution , then sauntered over to an easy chair , and lit a cigarette .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 24]: `` Of course , when you talk so sweetly about my talks with Cassandra , I know you are inwardly gloating on golf .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 27]: You throw Cassandra to me as a sop , so that you may feel free , and have no scruples in leaving me day after day .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 3]: Never mind !
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 5]: retribution will be yours .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 3]: Poor angel !
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 53]: _ how _ tired you will get of hours and hours of undiluted Squire ... '' `` I 'm not so sure ; he is a type , and I 'm interested in types , and from the golfer 's point of view , an approximate handicap covers a multitude of sins .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 11]: And I do n't propose to confine myself to Raynor .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 13]: I asked Peignton to come down , and he was delighted . ''
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 4]: Grizel frowned thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 6]: `` I like Captain Peignton .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 36]: It 's noble of me , for he has never quite made up his mind to like me , but I 'm not altogether sure that you were wise to ask him this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 9]: `` For Heaven 's sake why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 6]: Martin 's bewilderment was transparent .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 11]: Grizel dropped her eyes , and played with her cigarette .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 14]: A suspicious listener might have accused her of searching for a judicious reply .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 5]: -- he 's engaged .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 7]: And I do n't want her .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 8]: She would be in the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 11]: `` Is it necessary to ask her at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 7]: `` If he comes , yes .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 6]: I think we ought . ''
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 7]: Martin looked thoughtful in his turn .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 33]: It was evident that , like his wife , he was not anxious for the society of Teresa Mallison , but after a moment 's consideration he was ready with a solution .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 17]: `` We 'll ask her from Friday till Monday , at the end of his stay .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 7]: Then they can travel home together .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 11]: She will understand that he is asked primarily for golf .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 14]: What on earth makes you imagine that he does n't like you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 5]: Grizel pursed her lips .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 17]: `` I think ... _ he _ thinks , I have more than my share ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 6]: `` Of -- what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 4]: `` Happiness . ''
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 6]: Martin 's face softened eloquently .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 7]: `` So you have , darling .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 6]: So you always will have .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 7]: But that 's thanks to yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 11]: And why should he grudge you your happiness , pray ?
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 6]: Is n't he happy himself ?
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 7]: Is n't his Teresa happy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 10]: Teresa is as happy as Teresa can be . ''
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 6]: `` Well , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 9]: exclaimed Martin conclusively , and dropped the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 26]: He had wisely abandoned the effort of following his wife 's nights of thought , and was for the moment more engrossed with his own .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 36]: He glanced at the clock , and there fell over his face that restless , straining expression which Grizel had learned to recognise as a sign that work in the study was not going well .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 17]: Being a wife she dared a question which from anyone else would have been an offence .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 5]: `` Book dragging ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 4]: `` Badly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 7]: `` What 's the trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 7]: `` Come to a full stop .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 37]: I know where I am , and I know where I want to get , but there 's a middle distance to be filled in ... filled , not padded ... and ideas wo n't come .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 21]: I need four or five chapters to give the characters time to -- er -- '' `` I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 12]: Grizel tilted her chin and assumed an expression of ferocious absorption .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 22]: She would emerge from it presently and make suggestions , and none of the suggestions would be of the slightest use .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 25]: Martin knew as much , but he lingered all the same because Grizel was Grizel , and whatever she said delighted him to hear .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 27]: `` Make the heroine go into the park , and sit on a bench , and talk to an old man ... '' `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 14]: `` Well ... A shabby old man , but with signs of race .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 25]: He would hint at troubles , and she would sort of lure him on to tell her his history -- '' `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 6]: `` How stupid you are !
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 9]: Then of course you must work it out .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 22]: He might be a miser , or an uncle from China -- or the husband of someone who had married again .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 8]: _ Is _ anyone married again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 14]: `` Oh , well then , she _ wo n't _ meet him !
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 6]: ... What about a fire ?
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 9]: you had a fire in the last book .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 4]: Or a flood .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 13]: Is there a river anywhere handy that could flood them out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 6]: `` There is not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 7]: `` Do n't be so blighting .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 6]: I 'm trying to help .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 7]: Could there be a lost will ?
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 13]: It 's banal , I know , but what can you do ?
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 12]: Everyone writes novels , and there is n't a plot left .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 5]: Even leprosy is overdone .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 19]: Now if you 'd bring in a few chapters about the parlourmaid I 'd write them for you .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 4]: That reminds me !
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 14]: I was forgetting to ask you something , and it 's most important .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 26]: Parsons says there are two handkerchiefs short from the laundry , and the man is coming for the money , and what will I say .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 2]: Martin !
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 7]: what _ do I _ say ?
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 10]: What does one say when the laundry is short ?
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 5]: Should I be angry ?
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 3]: How angry ?
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 18]: I do n't care a dump about the old things , but I 'll pretend I do .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 21]: Shall I tell him you 've a cold , and have only a dozen and ca n't do without them ?
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 9]: Ought I to make him leave his own ?
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 13]: Just give me a hint , and I 'll work it out .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 5]: Could I demand compensation ?
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 3]: Happy thought !
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 5]: Are they insured ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 7]: Martin laughed and shrugged his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 4]: `` Domesticities again .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 4]: I 'm off .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 11]: I believe Katrine used to dock off sixpences ... Well !
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 14]: you will let the Raynors know that we can have the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 18]: `` I 'll ring up Cassandra , and ask her to drive round to talk over details .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 19]: Whenever I 'm sorry that I married you , Martin , I 'm glad again because of Cassandra .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 9]: I 'm a real safety valve to Cassandra .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 14]: The poor dear soul had no one to grumble to before I came .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 27]: A sympathetic woman listener who is not above throwing in a curse on her own account is absolutely necessary when one lives alone with a man .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 24]: Now look at you -- '' Martin shut the door firmly behind him , and mounted the staircase two steps at a time .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 4]: MRS MALLISON SHOCKED .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 7]: Mrs Mallison possessed an insatiable curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 30]: Its area , it is true , covered but a few square miles of country , for everything that happened outside Chumley was powerless to stir her to interest .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 50]: Kingdoms might rise , kingdoms might fall , science might evolve the most marvellous of inventions , beneath a cataclysm of nature , whole provinces might be wrecked -- Mrs Mallison listened to the announcement as she sipped her morning coffee , and murmured an automatic : `` Dear !
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 2]: Dear !
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 2]: Tut !
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 3]: Tut ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 20]: the while she continued to ponder why Mrs Gainsby was hurrying to the early train wearing her best hat !
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 32]: Nothing that affected her neighbours was too trifling to engage her attention , and her mind , empty of so much , was a veritable storehouse for inconvenient numbers and dates .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 61]: When the doctor 's chimney went on fire , she was able to declare that to her certain knowledge the sweep had not been on duty in that house since the third of March , the day of the blizzard , when Mrs Jones wanted him at the same time , because the weight of snow made her soot fall .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 17]: The doctor 's wife had plainly been guilty of the folly of trying to save two-and-six .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 29]: She knew to an hour the age of every one of the younger generations , and laboriously corrected lapses of memory on the part of relations or parents .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 22]: It was impossible for one of her acquaintances to resurrect so much as a buckle without her instant and cordial recognition .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 23]: `` And the paste buckle that you had on your purple silk all those years ago -- how well it comes in !
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 25]: ` Keep a thing a dozen years , and it comes into fashion again , ' as my old mother used to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 32]: She remembered the Vicar 's sermons when he preached them after a lapse of years , and the good man chid himself because the fact brought annoyance , rather than gratification .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 35]: Not for the world would he have put it into words , but deep in his heart lay the thought that it was useless to remember precepts , which were not put into practice .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 31]: Within her own home Mrs Mallison 's curiosity reached its acutest pitch , so that it became sheer torture to her to be shut out from even the smallest happening .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 17]: To overhear tags of conversation was insufferable , unless she were instantly supplied with the context .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 37]: Thus to come into a room and hear a daughter say , `` I always thought so , '' was to know no peace until she had been enlightened as to the context of the statement .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 9]: `` What have you always thought , Teresa ?
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 11]: Teresa , _ what _ do you always think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 6]: `` Nothing , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 4]: `` My dear !
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 2]: Nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 4]: I heard you .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 12]: As I opened the door I distinctly heard you say so .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 7]: What were you talking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 5]: `` Nothing , mother .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 8]: Nothing worth repeating , at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 7]: You would n't be interested . ''
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 9]: `` My dear , I am always interested .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 12]: How could I not be interested in my children 's thoughts ?
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 19]: Wait till you are a mother yourself ... You ca n't possibly have forgotten in this short time .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 7]: What do you always think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 18]: Then Teresa would set her lips and look obstinate , and Mary would come to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 14]: `` Teresa said that she always thought silk wore better than satin . ''
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 46]: There was a ferocious patience in the tone in which Mary responded to these calls , it was the patience of a wild beast which must submit or starve , but behind the submission a discerning observer might have observed the teeth and the claw .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 10]: But then no discerning observer troubled about Mary Mallison .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 14]: She was one of the women on whom the world turns its back .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 41]: As might naturally be expected , the arrival of the post-bag furnished Mrs Mallison with some of the most thrilling moments of her day , and her interest in the correspondence of others was even keener than in her own .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 33]: If the recipient was out at the time the letter was delivered , she examined postmark and writing to discover the writer , and then set to work to anticipate the contents .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 14]: `` Mrs Fenton writing to Mary ... What can she have to say ?
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 14]: ... She 's at home , from the postmark ... They never correspond .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 3]: Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 4]: ... Most peculiar !
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 23]: Perhaps it 's a subscription ... Perhaps it 's a bazaar ... Mary did once help her in a sale of work .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 10]: Baskets , I remember -- a stall of baskets .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 6]: She wore a brown dress .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 5]: She must certainly refuse .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 6]: Too many calls at home .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 9]: What does she want gadding over to Mayfield ?
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 3]: ... That !
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 8]: Madam Rose 's bill again for Teresa .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 4]: The third time .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 6]: Papa must speak to her .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 7]: Gives the house a bad name .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 8]: And ... er ... what 's this ?
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 12]: I _ know _ the writing -- do I know it ?
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 8]: Is it a man or a woman ?
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 6]: They all write alike nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 3]: No crest .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 11]: On such a good paper one would expect a crest .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 55]: I must explain to Teresa that on no account can I allow her to correspond with men ... Perhaps it is a schoolfellow ... '' It was at the breakfast table one morning that the great news came , and it was imparted in a dull , legal-looking envelope addressed to the eldest daughter .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 22]: Mrs Mallison 's eye caught the lawyer 's name on the flap of the envelope , and pounced on the significance .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 10]: `` Ratcliffe and Darsie -- Miss Brewster 's lawyers .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 7]: She 's left you a legacy .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 7]: I expected it , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 5]: Quite the right thing .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 15]: Her own godchild , but I did not think we should hear so soon .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 3]: Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 3]: How much ?
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 23]: She was not rich , so you ca n't expect a large sum ... Twenty pounds perhaps , to buy a ring .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 3]: Most kind .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 8]: Possibly a hundred ... _ Mary _ !
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 5]: We are all waiting !
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 6]: Why do n't you speak ?
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 5]: Quite a long letter .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 8]: Read it out -- read it out !
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 7]: Most inconsiderate to keep us waiting .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 7]: How much is the legacy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 7]: `` There is no legacy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 26]: Mrs Mallison 's breath forsook her , for it might be the quarter of a minute , then returned with renewed force and violence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 4]: _ What _ ?
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 2]: Impossible !
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 2]: None ?
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 4]: Then why write ?
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 9]: A lawyer 's letter costs six and eightpence .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 6]: There must be a reason .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 6]: Mary -- I insist ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 14]: Mary lifted her colourless eyes , and looked her mother in the face .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 8]: `` Miss Brewster left me no legacy .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 6]: She left me her principal .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 4]: Everything she had .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 9]: I shall have five hundred a year . ''
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 7]: `` God bless my soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 5]: cried the Major loudly .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 14]: Teresa flushed scarlet over face and neck , and stared with distended eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 7]: `` Oh , _ Mary _ !
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 4]: I 'm glad !
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 4]: How ripping . ''
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 5]: `` Ripping , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 16]: Is that the best word you can find for your sister 's good fortune ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 21]: Mrs Mallison raised her eyes in ecstatic rejoicing to the electric light ornament which decorated the centre of the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 12]: `` Thank God that I have lived to see this day !
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 19]: I told papa when we chose her as godmother that it might be for the child 's benefit .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 10]: Not likely to marry , and a settled income .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 17]: We thought of your welfare , Mary , in your long clothes and see the result .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 12]: And I made a point of inviting her once a year .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 15]: She was devoted to you as a child -- you remember the pink corals ?
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 16]: but of late with her ill-health we have fallen apart , and she seemed indifferent .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 7]: Nothing , even on your birthdays .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 3]: what news !
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 3]: What thankfulness .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 5]: All things work together .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 9]: Five -- hundred -- a -- year ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 8]: Her large body expanded in beatific realisation .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 6]: `` Five hundred -- pounds .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 15]: It 's marvellous how much a few hundreds mean after necessities have been provided .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 25]: As I have said a hundred times -- after a thousand , every hundred does the work of two ... What about a brougham ?
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 8]: We have always needed a second carriage .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 24]: Papa and I are getting too old to drive in the open in winter , and Teresa goes out so much at night .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 15]: It would be only the initial expense , for Johnson could do the work .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 7]: He might need a new livery .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 17]: And the little conservatory opening out of the drawing-room ... That has been a long-felt want .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 14]: So cheerful , -- and you could look after the plants , dear .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 4]: Such agreeable work !
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 22]: ... Five hundred , -- about forty pounds a month , ten pounds a week , nearly thirty shillings a day .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 6]: My dear , what riches !
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 15]: Quite a little millionaire ... So apropos too , with a wedding in prospect .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 21]: It would have been a strain out of a regular income , and one hesitates to break in on capital .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 15]: Perhaps your rich sister will give you your trousseau , Teresa , who knows !
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 9]: Indeed I feel sure she will wish it .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 18]: It does n't seem suitable for one sister to have so much , and the other nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 25]: You may not care to halve it , Mary , perhaps halving would be too much , but a hundred a year for Teresa .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 6]: Oh , certainly a hundred .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 24]: It is so nice for a young wife to have pin-money of her own ... What about a brass tablet in the church ?
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 24]: Quite a nice one for forty pounds , and she worshipped there in her youth ... We must wear black , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 6]: Handsome black , only suitable .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 7]: We could run up to town .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 5]: Ah , Mary ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 24]: her voice grew arch and playful , `` if it were not spring , I would remind you of my ambition for sables !
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 12]: Nothing looks so well as handsome black and a sable set .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 3]: Never mind !
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 3]: Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 4]: Christmas is coming !
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 8]: Dear me , quite a Portunatus cap !
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 23]: Only to wish , and the thing appears ... Papa , you must tell Mary what _ you _ want next ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 27]: Then Mary spoke , and if a peal of thunder had crashed through the sunlit room , the shock could not have been half so great .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 17]: `` I shall not give , '' said Mary slowly , `` one penny to anybody .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 9]: I shall keep every farthing for myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 21]: Major Mallison gaped , Teresa screwed up her face and stared at her sister with a vivid kindling of interest .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 3]: At last !
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 3]: At last !
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 10]: the dormant spirit had roused itself from its lethargy .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 15]: Teresa felt a sympathy , an excitement , which had no element of self .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 17]: She braced her knees under the table , and sent forth a telegraphic message of support .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 8]: `` Go it , Mary ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 17]: _ Mary _ , '' gasped Mrs Mallison deeply , `` have you gone mad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 10]: `` Oh , no , '' said Mary calmly .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 8]: `` I may have been mad before .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 23]: I 've sometimes fancied I was , but I 'm sane now , I 'm more than sane ... I 'm free !
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 12]: I 've been only a slave -- a white slave . ''
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 20]: Mrs Mallison cast an agonised glance at the sideboard and bookcases , as if terrified of offending their susceptibilities .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 6]: She held up protesting hands .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 3]: `` Silence !
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 10]: _ Mary _ ... Have you no decency ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 10]: `` I 'm sorry if the word shocks you .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 11]: Perhaps it would be better to say a useful maid .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 19]: I 've been a useful maid at thirty pounds a year , and no holiday nor nights out .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 37]: I 've done what I 've been told to do , from morning till night , and from night till morning when it has been necessary , but I 've had no life of my own .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 21]: I 'm thirty-two , and I 've never even invited a friend to tea without first having to ask permission .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 27]: I have no corner of my own to which I can invite a friend -- not a corner in the world -- except a tireless bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 14]: Every servant in the house has had more freedom than I have had .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 9]: I have not been free even to think .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 12]: It was useless , for what I thought was never noticed .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 7]: Nobody troubled about what I thought .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 9]: I was just Mary -- a useful machine .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 14]: Nobody takes any notice of a machine , except to keep it oiled .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 30]: Nobody expects it to be sad , or in pain , or lonely , or discouraged , or tired of turning round and round in the same small space .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 32]: Nobody suspects it of having a heart ... but it has all the same , and when it has a chance of breaking free -- it does not let it go .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 6]: This money is my chance .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 19]: A woman brought up as I have been is powerless without money , and I have had none .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 21]: I 've never had a penny piece in my life for which I 've not had to say thank you .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 26]: The money you have given me has never been looked upon as my right , as payment for work ... yet I have worked hard .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 9]: I have given you my whole life . ''
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 26]: `` You have done your duty in the position in which it has pleased God to place you , '' said Mrs Mallison with dignity .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 21]: As Mary 's excitement had increased , she had grown quieter , and her face showed signs of mental shock .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 25]: Not the news of the legacy itself had been so startling as this sudden outbreak on the part of the silent , patient daughter .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 9]: Nor was her distress in any sense affected .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 22]: According to her lights she had been a good mother , careful of colds and draughts , of food and raiment .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 37]: Five minutes ago she would have declared her conscience to be free of reproach so far as Mary was concerned ; it was paralysing to discover that she had been looked upon as a heartless task-mistress .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 23]: Her exultation of a moment before was replaced by pain and discomfort , and her voice took the deeper tone of earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 31]: `` You have fulfilled your duty in the place in which it has pleased God to place you ... and have done the work He set you to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 9]: `` Are you so sure of that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 22]: Mary asked , and Mrs Mallison had an agonised conviction that the girl was going to turn atheist into the bargain !
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 20]: `` Then why did He make me with a woman 's heart , with a woman 's natural longing ?
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 27]: Why did He give me the instinct to crave for someone of my own , who would put me first , instead of nowhere at all .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 7]: Someone who would _ care _ .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 16]: And it is n't only people that a woman wants , -- it 's things !
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 7]: What had I of my own ?
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 5]: The clothes I wear .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 3]: Nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 12]: No pauper in the land is poorer than I have been !
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 23]: If this is my appointed place and I have done my duty in it , why am I so empty and tired ?
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 4]: Poor Mary Mallison !
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 8]: whom everyone pities , and nobody wants .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 4]: Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 18]: you may think I do n't know how people talk of me , but I do know !
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 7]: You say it yourself quite often .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 5]: ` Poor Mary . '
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 20]: _ Why _ am I poor Mary ... whose fault is it that I have missed my chance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 10]: `` I think you are forgetting yourself , Mary .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 13]: You talk very strangely , very -- indelicately , I must say .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 10]: I suppose you mean that you are not married .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 9]: You can hardly call that my fault ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 7]: `` I am not so sure .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 7]: What chance did you give me ?
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 47]: If I 'd been a boy you would have sent me to college , and paid money to give me a start , but I was only a girl , and it was cheaper to have a governess than to send me to a good school .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 12]: So I was educated at home , and made no friends .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 28]: That meant no visits , no change , but just Chumley always Chumley , and the five or six young men I 'd known all my life .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 20]: I could count up on two hands all the marriageable men I have met in the last ten years .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 18]: It bored you to entertain , so we had no young people here till Teresa came home .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 16]: I was not pretty nor clever , but I should have made a good wife .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 28]: Some man might have loved me ... If you had given me a chance I might have been happy now , living in my own home . ''
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 6]: There was a dead silence .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 8]: Mrs Mallison was too shocked to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 8]: Of all her emotions this was predominant .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 4]: She was shocked .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 45]: Shocked that a spinster daughter should openly regret marriage and a mate , shocked that such feelings should find vent in words , shocked that a man -- albeit her own husband -- should be present to hear such sentiments emerge from virgin lips .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 15]: Shocked for Teresa , the bride , down whose cheeks large tears were rolling .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 21]: Mrs Mallison believed them to be tears of shame , but in reality they betokened the purest sympathy and regret .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 7]: Major Mallison stared with glassy eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 22]: Suddenly he cleared his throat and spoke , and the sound of his voice caused yet another shock to the hearers .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 8]: Another dumb creature had found his voice .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 10]: `` The girl is right , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 6]: `` She speaks the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 8]: I wish she had spoken before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 10]: He paused for a moment painfully rumpling the tablecloth .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 12]: `` It would have been kinder to speak out , Mary .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 8]: I should have endeavoured to meet you .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 6]: But thirty-two is not old .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 7]: You can still enjoy your life .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 25]: As for the money , I wish you all to understand one thing : I require no help , and I accept no help .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 13]: What is necessary and suitable for my household , I can supply .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 16]: I have done so in the past , and can do so for the future .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 8]: Your fortune is your own , Mary .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 7]: Do with it as you please .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 5]: We need no contribution .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 6]: You hear that , Margaret ?
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 4]: You understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 8]: `` Yes , Henry , I understand .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 13]: I am learning to understand a great many things this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 16]: The old man rose feebly , and stood plucking at the edge of the tablecloth .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 15]: It was evident that there was something more which he was trying to say .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 9]: Mary looked up , and their eyes met .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 42]: `` All these years , '' said her father slowly , `` while you have been silent , running after your mother , serving us all , appearing so patient , -- has there been bitterness in your heart , Mary ?
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 5]: Bitterness and rebellion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 13]: The two pairs of eyes held one another in a steady gaze .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' Mary said .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 4]: the Major winced .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 10]: `` That hurts me , '' he said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 8]: `` That hurts me , Mary ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 7]: He turned and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 22]: Mrs Mallison stood up in her turn , and began rolling up her napkin before putting it into its silver ring .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 13]: She reserved her parting shot until her husband was out of hearing .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 11]: `` Well , Mary , I hope you are satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 19]: You have turned our rejoicings into bitterness and revilings , and sorely hurt and distressed your poor father .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 11]: I fear your fortune will bring you no blessing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 16]: The door closed loudly , and the sisters were left alone , abashed and discomfited .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 41]: When our minds are overflowing with the consciousness of our own grievances , it is always irritating to be forced to realise that there are two sides to every question , and that we ourselves are not altogether without blame .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 30]: Mary Mallison had so long been in subjection to her parents , that the consciousness of their serious displeasure overwhelmed for the moment the smart of her own injuries .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 20]: She was still obstinate , still determined , but her conscience was pricked , and she was unheroically afraid .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 9]: `` Oh , Trissie ... they are cross !
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 10]: Do you think they will ever forgive me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 16]: `` Do n't be a rotter , Mary , '' the younger sister cried scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 12]: `` I was thankful to hear you assert yourself at last .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 19]: For goodness ' sake do n't give one bleat , and then relapse back into the old rut .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 8]: _ Of course _ they are cross !
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 6]: What else did you expect ?
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 8]: Did you expect them to be pleased ?
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 23]: If you are going to break loose and lead an independent life you must be strong enough not to mind crossness . ''
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 15]: `` Yes , but I ca n't , and besides -- father was sad !
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 7]: That 's worse than being cross .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 9]: I felt miserable when he said that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 5]: he was right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 6]: Teresa pronounced with characteristic certainty .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 9]: `` It was sneakish to go on pretending .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 13]: -- It was n't patience at all , it was sheer funk .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 20]: It would have been better for you , and everyone concerned , if you 'd spoken out years ago .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 18]: You would have had more freedom , and mother would have been less of a bully . ''
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 32]: `` It would have been better if I 'd been born with a different disposition , a disposition which would have _ let _ me speak , '' Mary said bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 28]: `` I am a coward , as you say , and nothing but a shock like this morning 's news could have wound me up to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 12]: It seems hard that people should have such different dispositions . ''
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 4]: Teresa mumbled vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 27]: She was not interested in the difference of temperament ; she was interested in Mary 's fortune , and how she was going to use it .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 23]: She pushed aside her cup and plate , leant her arms on the table , and cupped her chin in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 14]: `` Look here , Mary -- what are you going to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 7]: `` I 'm going away . ''
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 6]: `` I do n't know !
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 2]: Anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 2]: London .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 2]: Paris .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 7]: It does n't matter very much .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 14]: I want just to be away from Chumley , and to be free .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 13]: To go where I like , and do as I like . ''
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 4]: `` Alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 5]: Mary 's face twitched .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 7]: `` I have no friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 5]: `` You have acquaintances .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 17]: They would be glad ... lots of people would be glad to go with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 8]: They are part of the old life .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 7]: They would stare and take notes .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 7]: They would write home and gossip .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 13]: It would be no use going away -- I should not escape .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 11]: The old atmosphere would be round me all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 6]: I shall go alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 54]: Teresa sat silent , striving to grasp the extraordinary idea of Mary on her own , Mary going forth into the world , staying in hotels , wandering about bustling streets , alone , always alone ... There was something pathetic in the prospect which pierced even to the preoccupied , girlish heart .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 11]: She frowned , and racked her brains for illuminating suggestions .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 5]: Where could Mary go ?
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 5]: What could Mary do ?
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 30]: To stay alone in an hotel , with no occupation to help one through the aimless hours , would be desolation , yet the mental searchings brought no solution .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 23]: Honestly , Teresa could not think of one thing outside the Chumley radius , in which Mary took a flicker of interest .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 40]: In imagination she entered a great restaurant , heard the babble of voices , the flare of the band , and beheld in a corner the dun-coloured figure of Mary , seated in solitary state at a flower-decked table .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 20]: She saw the other visitors stream forth to their various pleasures , and Mary creep silently up the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 11]: She saw Mary 's face peering disconsolately through dusty panes .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 23]: Breed a bird in a cage , and rear it there , and at the age of maturity throw open the door .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 12]: The bird will fly and as it flies it will sing .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 24]: It has its moment of joy , but when the moments have passed into days , its lifeless body falls to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 6]: Liberty may come too late .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 11]: Teresa looked at her sister with puzzled , unhappy eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 3]: `` Mary !
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 6]: I do n't like it .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 7]: You ought not to go alone .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 8]: Those big places can be so desolate .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 20]: You see all the other people talking and laughing together , and feel like a pelican in the wilderness .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 9]: What would you do from morning till night ?
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 29]: Do n't think I 'm hinting ; I would n't come with you if you asked me , because of Dane , but _ do _ take someone !
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 13]: If you go alone , you 'll be bored to death . ''
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 19]: Mary rose from the table , the precious envelope in her hand , and turned towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 17]: `` Very well , then , '' she said quietly , `` I will be bored .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 13]: _ But I 'll be bored in my own way _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOURTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 3]: A SENSATION .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 35]: `` I should like to ask Peignton and his _ fiancee _ to dinner , '' Martin said , and Grizel nodded obediently , and said : `` Then we must have roast fowl !
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 16]: Roast fowl , I 've discovered , is the fatted calf of the middle classes .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 22]: Whenever I tell Cook that a friend is coming , she says : ` A fowl , I suppose , mum .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 6]: Three-and-three , or three-and-six ? '
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 15]: I always say three-and-three , and feel virtuous for the rest of the day .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 26]: If it 's three-and-three , there 's just breast enough for ` the room ' ; the extra threepence leaves a picking for the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 21]: Cook says it 's cheaper ` in the end ' to give the three-and-six , but I take no notice .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 20]: Sometimes I suspect the poulterer of a dark design , and believe that there 's no difference at all !
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 11]: The extra threepence is just a trap for the unwary .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 2]: However !
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 6]: ... enough of these details .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 10]: Certainly we 'll ask them if you wish it .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 4]: And who else ?
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 11]: We ca n't contend with them alone all night long .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 20]: I adore lovers in theory , but I object to feeling _ de trop _ in my own house .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 36]: If we were a _ partie carree _ they would expect me to have an important letter to write for the early post , and you to come with me to look over my shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 6]: No , you do n't !
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 23]: We 'll have a crowd , and let them realise from the first that there 's no chance of a quiet moment .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 4]: Who else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 3]: Martin deliberated .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 4]: `` The Raynors ?
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 11]: They 've been fairly intimate ... '' `` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 15]: I must reserve Cassandra to help me later on when we tackle the formidables .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 19]: This shall be a lively , informal affair , got up in a hurry to wish them luck .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 10]: Quite a short invitation , the shorter the better .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 13]: Young people for choice -- cheery , and fond of roast fowl .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 6]: Mary Mallison for one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 9]: `` Because she is young and cheery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 8]: `` It does n't matter a bit .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 29]: She is going to be asked , '' maintained Grizel , with that characteristic inconsequence which she had the power to turn into the most charming of attributes .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 20]: `` She shall have the nicest partner , and the best place , and the merrythought all to herself .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 10]: I 'm so _ sorry _ for Mary Mallisons .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 69]: There are such a horde of them , and nobody wants them , and they do n't want themselves , and it 's all so wrong and wasteful and piteous , and I never see one of them , and look into her poor , starved little face that I do n't say to myself with a shudder , ` Suppose that was _ me _ ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 6]: Martin smiled at her adoringly .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 15]: but it is n't , and it never by any possibility could have been .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 12]: Besides , do n't you think it 's their own fault ?
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 19]: You were twenty-eight when we were married , and you had lived alone with a cross old aunt .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 25]: You might easily have turned into a Mary Mallison yourself , if you had so little spirit as to allow yourself to be starved .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 20]: Even if you had never married , can you imagine yourself sinking into a depth of apathy and indifference ?
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 7]: There 's something contemptible about it .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 8]: An unmarried woman has such wide possibilities .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 12]: There is so much work waiting for her to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 9]: `` If she is allowed to do it !
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 30]: But what if there is a chain around her neck , in the shape of some relation who thinks that her work is to be an understudy at home ?
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 24]: What would Mrs Mallison have to say to wide possibilities , while she wants a daughter to run messages and arrange the flowers ?
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 25]: What would _ you _ have said in the days when you needed Katrine , if she had talked of her life 's work ?
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 26]: Her work was obviously to darn your socks until such time as you found someone else whom you liked better , when -- pouf ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 11]: -- she snapped her fingers -- `` enough of Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 16]: Let her go out into the wilds , and see what she can find ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 10]: She very speedily found something that she liked better .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 10]: Katrine was not a happy illustration , young woman !
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 23]: In your ever-present desire to be personal , you overlooked -- '' `` Exceptions prove the rule , '' Grizel said stubbornly .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 16]: `` Besides , we were not discussing Katrine , we were discussing the roast-fowl dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 9]: Two Mallisons , the Hunters , Captain Peignton .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 3]: Who else ?
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 16]: We might as well make it up to ten while we are about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 28]: Martin suggested the name of some young people whose parents had already entertained himself and his wife , and Grizel sighed , a long sigh of resignation .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 10]: `` What shall we do with them afterwards ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 4]: `` Talk . ''
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 9]: `` They ca n't talk , bless you !
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 6]: Do n't know how . ''
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 9]: `` Then you must talk to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 5]: `` I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 24]: A dull dinner party pumps me dry , and I simply can not stand desultory drawls for an hour on top of it .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 14]: I get fidgets , and yawn , -- heavens , how I yawn !
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 12]: It 's not a mite of use telling me not to .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 5]: I _ must _ .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 14]: If I swallow them down my nose swells , and my eyes fill .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 20]: I look as if I had hay fever ... Do you never get fidgets at a dull party ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 4]: `` Mental ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 2]: Physical .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 4]: In your legs .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 3]: Far worse !
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 6]: They wo n't keep still .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 8]: I 've lived through some shocking hours .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 17]: -- I 'd rather play puss-in-the-corner , than talk twaddle for an hour on end . ''
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 21]: `` I should thoroughly enjoy seeing Mary Mallison playing puss-in-the-corner , '' Martin declared , and beat a hasty retreat .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 17]: Experience had proved that it was a colossal mistake to endeavour to change Grizel 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 75]: The most convincing of arguments had no power to move her ; while moral axioms sent her galloping headlong in the opposite direction to that in which she was directed ; moreover , it was a waste of energy to essay the task , since her rebellions were but word deep , and the passage of a short half-hour was usually sufficient to disperse them , and restore her to her usual complacent radiance .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 20]: This morning the radiance returned at the prospect of Cook 's face when she heard of the impending trial .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 29]: Grizel did not think of her own face as she sat at the head of her table awaiting the serving of dishes prepared by a good plain cook .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 18]: She had seen that expression more than once of late on the faces of worthy Chumley hostesses .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 31]: It was a compound expression , which included a smile , a determined animation of the eyes , and withal a pucker , a tightening , a tenseness of anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 30]: For all their forced gaiety the eyes had a faraway expression ; they were penetrating through dividing walls , peering into saucepans , anxiously regarding the preparation of sauce .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 16]: Grizel had been quick to diagnose the symptoms , but her sympathy had been lacking .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 11]: `` Hang it all , it 's not her fault !
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 9]: _ She _ did n't cook it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 6]: had been the mental comment .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 19]: Cook , as had been expected , folded her arms and assumed an expression of acute resignation . ''
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 10]: _ Ten _ did you say , ` Um ?
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 4]: Twelve with yourselves .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 18]: I 'm not sure that the range ... How many courses were you thinking of having ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 5]: `` Oh , dozens .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 7]: As many as we can have .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 16]: If we do it at all , Cook , we 'll do it well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 5]: `` Clear soup ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 14]: `` We have n't come to soup yet , '' said Grizel cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 8]: `` Lots of things before soup . ''
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 28]: `` When I lived at the Robertses we were always giving dinners , but they studied me , as well as themselves , '' Cook replied poignantly .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 26]: `` Soup , of course , and fish , but she got in the entrees , to give me a clear hand with the joint .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 9]: Fowls mostly , or a saddle of mutton .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 18]: The sweets were cold , and she got in the savouries , and sometimes an ice pudding .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 9]: Then there was cheese straws , and dessert .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 9]: She always said I managed very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 6]: `` You would do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 3]: Grizel said .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 10]: `` Well , now you shall have a change .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 41]: I wo n't have anything at all like that ... '' It was by this time easy to make a selection of guests , as every visitable house in Chumley had made its own individual effort towards entertaining the bride .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 46]: Sometimes it was dinner , more often it was tea , and , as Grizel pathetically declared , not even a _ real _ tea , a tea where you could sit quietly in a comfortable chair , and gossip , and consume rich cake .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 34]: A tea as enjoyed in Chumley was a strenuous affair , when guests were bidden from four to six , and were expected to rack their brains over a number of nerve-racking problems .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 15]: The first invitation of the sort that Grizel received was for a Kate Tea .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 30]: She misread the first word for Cake , and thought it suitable , if a trifle ostentatious , but as she afterwards informed Cassandra , the awakening was rude .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 23]: `` It was ` Kate , ' my dear , not cake , -- a wretched Kate that haunted us all afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 15]: Did you realise that every second word in the English language ends with Kate ?
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 5]: Well , it does !
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 20]: and Mrs Morley read out a story , and we had to fill in the gaps with Kate words .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 22]: Kate had an untruthful nature and was given to prevari-Kate , so she got into trouble , and engaged an advo-Kate .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 3]: See ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 3]: Cassandra groaned .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 4]: `` Do n't !
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 3]: Too awful .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 13]: You 'll have dozens of these preposterous invitations if you once accept .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 6]: Why do you go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 4]: Grizel looked thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 6]: `` There was a prize .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 15]: -- I 'd be bored for hours for the chance of gaining a prize .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 16]: Why is it that the prospect of something for nothing has such a fatal lure ?
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 16]: I might win a manicure set , or a shoe-horn , or a leather bag .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 24]: I 've thousands already ; I would n't know what to do with the blessed things , but I crave to win them !
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 22]: I racked my brains over that wretched Kate until I was quite exhausted , and came out next to the bottom .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 10]: Next week there 's ` A Florin Tea . '
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 6]: What happens to a florin ?
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 8]: Do they give us one all round ?
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 7]: And a Photograph Tea after that .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 17]: Everyone takes a photograph of herself as a baby , and you guess Who 's who .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 11]: There 's going to be some scope for personal remarks .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 17]: There is a Smelling Tea too , but I 'm going to be ill for that .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 22]: She means well , dear lady , and I accepted with pleasure , but I shall stay at home with more .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 39]: I could n't respect myself going about smelling at little bags ... '' `` They tried the same sort of thing with me years ago , but I steadily refused , and now they have given me up .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 20]: You 'll have no peace in Chumley , Grizel , if you let yourself in for these dreadful entertainments .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 38]: You 'll be asked out to tea every afternoon of your life , to meet the same people , and sit in the same rooms , and hear the same little gossip over and over again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 17]: `` But that makes them so keen to have _ me _ for a change ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 5]: Grizel said , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 8]: `` My dear , they adore me .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 8]: I 'm a _ succes fou _ .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 28]: I wear different clothes wherever I go , and say all the maddest things that come into my head , and they hang on my every word .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 13]: The Kate hostess nearly cried because I did n't get the prize .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 11]: She was trying to give me hints all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 4]: It was touching !
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 9]: And I was _ so _ stupid . ''
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 8]: Cassandra regarded her with a puzzled air .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 8]: `` I believe you really enjoy it !
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 19]: And it 's so different from your old life , just as different as it was for me .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 11]: I ca n't think why you are n't bored ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 10]: `` I 'm never bored , '' Grizel declared .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 10]: `` At least , not all at a time .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 21]: It 's such a funny old world , and a bit of me is interested in everything that comes along .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 28]: Besides , I adore kindness , even when it disguises itself in Kate teas , and the least I can do is to be agreeable in return .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 11]: But I am thankful that I have you , Cassandra .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 16]: I should be lost without one real friend , who speaks my own language . ''
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 30]: There was no procrastination in Grizel 's nature ; what she had to do , must be done at once , if it were to be done at all .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 50]: Straight from the kitchen she adjourned to the telephone , rang up Teresa to make sure of the guests of honour , and then proceeded to scribble half a dozen of the most informal of invitations for an unfashionably early date , which were despatched forthwith to the post .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 38]: In an incredibly short space of time the answers were received , one and all accepting with pleasure , and Cook , divided between depression and elation , nerved herself to prepare the dinner of her life .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 27]: And now for the first time Grizel was to have a personal experience of the momentous influence of a dinner party in an ordinary middle-class establishment !
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 15]: For two days beforehand `` plannings ahead '' enveloped the atmosphere like a cloud .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 27]: The parlourmaid planned ahead in respect of extra polishing of silver and glass , and was testy in consequence , and disposed to neglect present work .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 58]: Cook 's whole energies seemed engrossed in the preparation of a mysterious substance yclept `` stock , '' which filled the house with the most unsavoury of odours , and she plainly considered it an injury to be expected to provide the ordinary meals , while Marie lashed the troubled waters by an attitude of amused disdain .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 50]: On the morning of the great day itself the very atmosphere was impregnated with strain , and the two domestics appeared to feel it a personal injury that Grizel herself remained smilingly unperturbed , and went about her way as placidly as if nothing unusual were in the air .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 44]: Parsons could not decide if it was ignorance , or pure `` cussedness '' which made the mistress suddenly decide to move the position of the furniture in the room above the dining-room , and to insist upon its being done without delay .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 51]: The gardener was called in to help , and Parsons of fell intent made the removal as noisy and cumbersome as it could be , and then discovered to her chagrin that both master and mistress had left the house , and had consequently suffered no annoyance from the noise .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 45]: By four o'clock a jingle of glass and china announced the fact that Parsons had begun the preparation of `` my table , '' a work of exceptional responsibility , since beyond a few general directions it had been left entirely in her charge .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 36]: The day before Grizel had unlocked the door of the upstairs safe-cupboard , wherein reposed some treasures from Lady Griselda 's famous collection of silver , the like of which Parsons had never before beheld .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 28]: Bowls and goblets , branching candelabra , finely wrought receptacles for fruit , large and small , high and low , each one a work of art .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 27]: Sufficient treasures for the adornment of a dozen dinner tables were packed away on those baize-covered shelves from which Parsons was bidden to take her choice .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 37]: Something of the same sombre elation filled her veins as that with which Cook in her kitchen whipped and stirred , and mixed and tasted , resigned to suffer in the hope of glory to come .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 34]: At six o'clock Mary Edwards , the hired waitress , would arrive ; a young person who , for a consideration of five shillings , officiated at every dinner party in the township .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 11]: No bellringer had greater facilities for advertisement than Mary Edwards .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 16]: `` She 'd tell them the style they did things up at Beverleys ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 33]: It was only after she was dressed for the evening that Grizel entered the dining-room to survey the completed table , while Parsons and Mary Edwards stood at attention by the sideboard .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 19]: She wore a wonderful gown of a deep purple _ crepe _ , encrusted with heavy gold embroideries .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 18]: A diamond aigrette sparkled on her head , but her beautiful white throat was bare of ornaments .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 23]: She looked young and radiant and exquisite , and to both black-robed , white-aproned onlookers came a spasm of an old regret .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 26]: The feminine in them revolted at the chasm between the classes ... `` Oh , to be a lady , and look like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 5]: `` Quite nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 4]: cried Grizel graciously .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 10]: `` You 've done the flowers beautifully , Parsons .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 4]: Is this Edwards ?
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 6]: How d'you do , Edwards !
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 7]: Sure you have everything you want ?
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 11]: Enough spoons , and forks , and things like that ?
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 5]: That 's all right !
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 11]: Then we 'll just go straight on , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 7]: No waiting between the courses . ''
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 6]: `` Yes , ma 'm .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 10]: No , ma 'm , '' said Edwards firmly .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 16]: Parsons thought of the pandemonium now reigning in the kitchen , and remained discreetly dumb .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 12]: Grizel gave another nod of approval and turned towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 13]: And then , at that very moment -- _ something happened _ !
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 19]: For the life of her during those first reeling seconds Grizel could not have told what it was .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 18]: There was a creeping , crawling sound , coming from above , and mysteriously growing in force .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 15]: Something was going to happen : in another second something _ was _ happening !
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 11]: It was a dream , a nightmare , a hallucination .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 19]: The clearly lighted room was suddenly filled with dust , with smoke , with floating particles of white .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 36]: Down , down , they fell , thicker and thicker , in a solid , snow-like mass , covering the table , covering the carpet , scattering a powdery foam to right and to left .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 35]: With more or less force certain particles fell on her own head , her own shoulders ; she gasped for breath ; felt on her tongue a strange dry taste and shuddered in disgust .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 22]: Across a space of whirling dust clouds Parsons 's face and Mary Edwards 's confronted her , white as two clowns .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 11]: Grizel shrieked , and still shrieking fled into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 6]: Doors opened , voices called .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 12]: At the end of the passage appeared Cook 's crimsoned face .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 23]: Martin rushed down the staircase , followed by an exclaiming Marie , and all three stared petrified at the sight before them .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 30]: Parsons and Edwards had followed Grizel 's lead , and were now flanking her on each side , pressing their hands to their hearts , and gasping for breath .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 22]: All three were white from head to foot , and on the floor around them the carpet was whitened to match .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 15]: `` For mercy 's sake , Grizel , _ what _ has happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 4]: cried Martin loudly .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 60]: Then , lifting his eyes , he glanced through the open door of the dining-room , and beheld ... Where had stretched a smooth expanse of white , there were now unsightly gaps showing glimpses of dust and timber : where the lines of the cornice had neatly bordered the room , was now a rough and jagged edge .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 21]: The ceiling had fallen , gently , unostentatiously , without fuss or clamour , and deposited itself upon the floor !
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 8]: At that moment the door bell rang .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIFTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 4]: AMONG THE BULBS .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 54]: By noon next day all Chumley was ringing with the story of Grizel Beverley 's first dinner party , for each feminine guest , anxious to have the privilege of telling the news , had hurried out of the house at the first possible moment , and betaken herself to the High Street .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 4]: `` My dear !
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 7]: you never knew anything so awful .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 43]: -- I never enjoyed anything so much in my life , '' said Miss Hunter , the doctor 's sister , to her dearest friend , and , linking arms , proceeded to give a detailed account of the night 's adventure .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 58]: How being herself the first to arrive at the house , the door had opened to reveal the tableau of the dishevelled mistress and maids , standing at the end of the hall , like figures of snow , and through an open door a vista of the dining-room , with a table heaped high with plaster .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 21]: A gruesome spectacle it had been ; the gleam of glass and silver serving but to accentuate the general ruin .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 44]: For the first moment Mrs Beverley had gaped at her guests as if not realising the meaning of their presence ; then suddenly she had begun to laugh , to peal with laughter , and to explain the nature of the sudden catastrophe .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 31]: Then Miss Hunter and her brother had said that of course they would return home , and she had stamped her foot , and said -- nothing of the kind !
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 16]: the dinner was cooked , -- and pray , who was to eat the dinner ?
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 18]: They were to stay ; everyone was to stay ; she would arrange everything in a twinkling !
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 6]: It would be first-rate fun .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 7]: And it _ was _ fun !
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 25]: At a word from their mistress the maids disappeared to change their gowns , while Grizel herself picked her way carefully up the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 23]: Then her French maid spread a sheet over the floor in the dressing-room , and Mrs Beverley stepped out of her dress .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 25]: She looked about eighteen in her petticoat , and as slight as an elf , yet there was n't a bone to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 9]: `` So different from my gridiron chest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 8]: said Miss Hunter , with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 3]: And then ?
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 33]: Well , then she rubbed the plaster off her hair , but it still looked all white and _ poudree _ , and stayed that way all evening , -- so becoming !
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 31]: and the maid came in with another beautiful gown -- green this time , and she was all fastened up and ready , almost as soon as the guests themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 5]: Then the fun began .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 31]: A number of bridge tables were produced , spread with white cloths , and arranged round the drawing-room , while an oak bench from the hall did duty as sideboard .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 35]: It was like a dinner in a restaurant , -- much better fun than sitting round an ordinary table , and everyone was so amused and excited that the evening went with a roar .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 52]: When the dessert stage was reached , two of the men volunteered for rescue service , shed their coats in the hall , and extricated the most promising dishes , the contents of which , having been carefully cleansed , were welcomed with loud cheers by the rest of the party .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 19]: `` I never , '' concluded Miss Hunter gleefully , `` was so rowdy in my life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 15]: `` Fancy having enough spoons and forks to go round a second time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 8]: was the Chumley maiden 's practical comment .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 21]: After a moment 's pause , she asked eagerly : `` And was Captain Peignton very attentive to Teresa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 11]: `` He was not sitting at the same table . ''
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 30]: Miss Hunter , paused in her turn , and added in a reflective voice : `` I do n't remember seeing him speak to her the whole evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 9]: In truth Dane was not a demonstrative lover .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 20]: The fact was patent to Teresa herself , and in the depths of her heart she acknowledged a lack .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 30]: Her own nature was not demonstrative ; with her own family her manner was indifferent almost to callousness , but with Dane she felt capable of a great tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 28]: She wished that he would be more tender to her ; that when they were alone together his manner of affectionate raillery would change to something deeper .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 13]: She wished above all things that he would speak of his love .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 46]: Mary 's questionings on the night of her sister 's betrothal had had something to do with awakening this longing , for when Teresa came to think over what had passed , it seemed as if most of the protestations had been made by herself .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 49]: He had asked if _ she _ cared , had kissed her and vowed to be true , but neither then or at any subsequent meeting had he lost his head , and said all the dear , mad , exaggerated sweetnesses which were the language of lovers .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 54]: Teresa had never before had a lover , but something in her blood , an instinct stronger than theory , told her that such exaggerations were not the creations of fiction , but that they existed in very truth , and to both speaker and hearer should appear the most precious of truths .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 70]: It was in her heart to lavish such protestations on Dane ; to tell him of the days when she had longed to touch his lean , brown hands , to lean her head against the rough frieze of his coat , to tell him how she had loved him , how she had longed for him , how she had prayed to be made good for his sake .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 76]: If she had given way to the impulse , Dane 's heart would have opened in its turn , since there are few men callous enough to remain unaffected by the love of a girl who is young , and fresh , and agreeable to the eye ; but Teresa 's strong sense of propriety forbade her to offer more than she received , and she sternly repressed the impulse to be `` silly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 31]: The engaged couple met often , since in a town of the size of Chumley every gathering brings together the same people , but _ tete-a-tetes _ were less frequent .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 61]: When Dane spent an evening at the Cottage , Teresa wondered if she were bold and unmaidenly because she longed to carry off her lover to the snuggery on the second floor , and felt exasperated when he sat contentedly in the drawing-room chatting with Mrs Mallison and Mary , and even volunteering to play a game with the Major .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 72]: On Sunday afternoons , when they were left alone as a matter of course , he would kiss her and stroke her hair , and say pretty things about her complexion , and the pretty blue dress , but invariably , infallibly he would relapse into the old quizzical , irresponsible mood , treating her as if she were an amusing child , rather than a woman and his promised wife .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 36]: Teresa 's attempts to give a serious turn to the conversation were ponderous enough to add to Dane 's amusement , and he would laugh still more , and even mimic her to her face .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 19]: Another subject that troubled Teresa was that her lover made no allusions to the date of their marriage .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 23]: At least once a day Mrs Mallison would enquire curiously , `` And has the Captain said anything about the date ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 11]: and it was humiliating to reply continually in the negative .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 36]: Lovers in books were always urgent in this respect ; the lovers she had known in real life had been no less impetuous , and in Dane 's case there seemed no reason for delay .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 16]: He was old enough ; he had enough money -- then why should they wait ?
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 29]: Teresa could not bring herself to introduce such a topic , but she did tentatively mention the honeymoon one day , asking Dane where he would take her .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 34]: For a moment he looked startled , but at the hint of a foreign tour he brightened , and they spent a delightful hour , discussing routes , and rival places of interest .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 27]: Teresa had never yet crossed the Channel , and Dane as a world-traveller felt a prospective pleasure in the thought of introducing her to fresh scenes .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 29]: To him it seemed pitiful to think of a human creature having spent twenty-four years in Chumley , with no change but an occasional month in seaside lodgings .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 17]: He displayed frank pity for such a fate , but Teresa exhibited no pity for herself .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 38]: She was very fond of Chumley ; she was fond of the Chumley people ; it was nice to travel now and then for a few weeks at a time , but she preferred a settled life .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 15]: Dane realised with amusement that Rome itself would be judged from a Chumley standpoint .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 26]: The Squire was highly amused at the story of Grizel 's first dinner party , and pointed many morals thereon for his wife 's benefit .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 26]: Almost it seemed that he blamed her because his own dining-room ceiling had never descended , and opened the way for such an unconventional evening .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 12]: `` But you would have sent them away from the door !
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 17]: Given the message to Johnson , and turned them away without even seeing them yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 4]: `` I should .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 6]: I plead guilty , Bernard .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 9]: I should have flown straight to a bath .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 41]: It takes a Grizel to make herself charming with whitewashed hair , but to do me justice I should _ not _ have chosen the morning of a dinner party to drag about heavy furniture in the room overhead . ''
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 7]: `` Did she do that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 6]: `` She had it done .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 23]: And the house being jerry built , the new ceilings are only guaranteed to stay up , if they are not pushed .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 49]: She pushed , and in revenge this particular ceiling loosened itself slowly , waiting for the crucial moment ... They have gone up to town for a week , while the room is put right , so Grizel will feel that the game is worth the candle . ''
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 24]: The Squire was silent , seeing that he himself had persistently refused to take his wife to town for the last eight years .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 43]: He was a country man , born and bred , and had never yet succeeded in discovering a time of year when the land was sufficiently lacking in interest to make it bearable to leave , and waste the time in town .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 27]: Moreover , with the extraordinary meanness which affects some rich men , he hated spending money on hotel bills , while his own house was open .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 21]: His wife could run up for a day when she needed new clothes , -- what more did she want ?
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 54]: Cassandra wanted a great deal more , -- she wanted to see , and to hear , to refresh her spirit with art and music , to meet people who spoke her own language , and understood her own thoughts , and get away from the stultifying influence of a little country town .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 21]: She had fought persistently for years in succession , but she had failed , and now she fought no more .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 9]: Bernard said she had come to her senses .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 15]: `` What are _ you _ going to do for the young couple ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 4]: he asked gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 8]: `` Another dinner would fall flat . ''
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 13]: `` And they were here so lately , '' Cassandra agreed quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 21]: `` Shall I fix the bulb party for next week , and ask the whole Mallison clan to lunch beforehand ?
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 8]: I 'm willing , if you are .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 8]: Of course Captain Peignton would come too .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 19]: It would be paying them a little extra attention , and avoid the bother of another dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 7]: `` Just as you like ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 29]: The Squire was appeased by the prospect of a garden party , as his wife had intended he should be , and she heaved a sigh of relief .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 38]: Another dinner with Dane and Teresa as guests would be insupportable so soon after that other evening when she had met his eyes across the banked-up flowers , and felt that strange , sweet certainty of understanding .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 37]: After hearing of the engagement she had felt an intense dread of the next meeting , which must surely reveal to her her own folly in believing that this man felt any special interest in herself .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 37]: He had looked pensive because he was in suspense ; his appeal to her had been to a married woman who had presumably been through the mill , and whose help he was anxious to gain .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 44]: She would see him radiant , glowing ; his eyes would no longer linger on hers , he would no longer have the air of standing by to await her command : he would be wholly , entirely , obtrusively absorbed in Teresa !
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 20]: Then suddenly the meeting came about , and nothing had been different ; everything had been bewilderingly the same .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 38]: They had met in a country lane , and Cassandra had made her congratulations in her most gracious and cordial manner , and he had thanked her in a few short words and stood looking -- looking .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 42]: -- He was not radiant , he was not aglow ; the subtle appeal of suffering had never been more strong : in spite of everything the strange , sweet certainty of inner sympathy and understanding once more flooded her being .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 23]: They spoke only a few words , and parted , and since that day Cassandra had seen Dane only in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 12]: Bernard reported him as a devoted lover , always in attendance .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 9]: He shrugged his shoulders with an easy tolerance .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 5]: It was a stage .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 4]: It would pass !
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 38]: Fortune favoured Cassandra , inasmuch as the bulb party fell on the day following that on which Mary Mallison had received the notice of her inheritance , and therefore the engagement took a second place in importance .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 22]: Major Mallison excused himself from the luncheon party on the score of sciatica , which being interpreted meant a sore heart .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 18]: Mary was his favourite daughter , and the discovery of her long revolt had wounded him sorely .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 39]: His wife also had had her hour of bitterness , but it was temperamentally impossible for Mrs Mallison to keep up an estrangement with any creature , male or female , who was on the wave of prosperity .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 27]: Mary , the dependent and helpless , would have been hard to forgive ; Mary the heiress commanded respect , and could be excused a weakness .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 47]: In the abundance of her satisfaction in escorting two successful daughters to luncheon at the Court , the last spark of resentment disappeared , and Mary 's determination to exploit the world on her own became a proof of spirit to be retailed with maternal pride .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 31]: The Squire laughed and rallied Mary with the superficial good-nature which he always exhibited to strangers , and Cassandra looked at her across the table with grave , wistful eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 31]: Poor Mary Mallison with the starved , bloodless face , and the starved , bloodless mind , -- could all the money in the world bring back her wasted youth ?
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 13]: Could all the money in the world unlock the gate of joy ?
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 12]: Cassandra felt a sudden rush of thankfulness for her own lot .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 15]: Thank God , she had lived ; she had experienced ; she had suffered .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 24]: If the best had been denied , she had been spared the worst , -- the lot of a superfluous , unwanted woman !
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 21]: After lunch the three guests were taken into the garden for a personally conducted tour before the general influx began .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 38]: The Squire naturally selected Teresa as his companion , but by a little manoeuvring his wife contrived that he should be saddled with Mrs Mallison also , so that she herself should be left alone with Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 9]: Cassandra wanted an opportunity of talking to Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 45]: Hitherto she had been merely a figurehead , a dull , dun-coloured person who walked by her mother 's side , replied in monosyllables when she was directly addressed , and apparently neither had , nor wished for , any existence of her own .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 10]: But now it appeared that Mary was in revolt .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 7]: Cassandra was conscious of a fellow-feeling .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 34]: She led the way down the sloping gardens , purposely increasing the distance from her husband and his companions , talking lightly on impersonal subjects until she could speak without fear of interruption .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 25]: Then she turned to Mary with the very winsome smile which she reserved for occasions when she had special reason for wishing to please .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 28]: `` Miss Mallison , I ran off with you , because I wanted an opportunity to tell you quietly how enchanted I am at your good fortune !
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 26]: It always delights me when nice things happen to women , and your nice thing is going to open the door to so many more .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 20]: Five hundred a year , and the world before you , and no ties to keep you at home !
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 20]: -- Mrs Mallison is so strong and active that it seems absurd to think of her as requiring help .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 52]: I 'm struggling with envy , for there is nothing at this moment that I should like so much as to feel free to go where I choose , and do what I choose , and even more than either , _ not _ to do what I do n't choose !
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 14]: My husband hates change , and you see I have sworn to obey !
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 14]: ... Will you have to wait very long before you get your money ?
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 7]: Lawyers are such wretches for procrastinating .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 15]: If you are like me , you will want to start at once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' said Mary flatly , `` I do .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 7]: And I am independent of lawyers .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 16]: My godmother left instructions that I was to be given two hundred pounds at once .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 9]: They sent me the cheque this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 6]: `` What a pattern godmother !
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 7]: I should have adored that woman .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 11]: I do n't need to know another thing about her .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 5]: That tells it all .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 11]: She had imagination ; and she had a heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 10]: `` She knew mother , '' said Mary terribly .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 22]: She was staring ahead in her usual unseeing fashion , and was unconscious of her companion 's involuntary start of dismay .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 27]: Never before had Cassandra heard a child speak of a parent in such grimly eloquent tones , and the instinct of centuries was shocked and distressed .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 17]: She froze into herself , and when she spoke again her voice had a different tone .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 29]: A moment before she had spoken as a friend , full of sympathy and fellow-feeling , now she was the Lady Cassandra Raynor , entertaining an insignificant guest .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 9]: `` It 's all delightful ; quite delightful .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 9]: So there is nothing to delay your movements !
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 7]: Can I give you any addresses ?
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 21]: I know of quite a good hotel in Paris , where I stay when I run over to buy frocks .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 8]: Not too fashionable , but very comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 7]: Quite ideal for a woman alone .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 5]: And dressmakers too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 12]: Cassandra thawed again at the introduction of a congenial subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 8]: _ Do _ go to my woman !
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 25]: She 's the most understanding creature , and knows exactly what will suit you before you have been in the room five minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 14]: She screwed up her eyes , and looked Mary over with critical gaze .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 26]: `` I think it will be blue for you ; a deep full blue , and just a touch of white at the throat . ''
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 21]: `` I 've worn blue serge coats and skirts almost every day of my life since I went to school .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 20]: I 'm sick of blue , '' Mary said , and Cassandra laughed and shuddered at the same moment .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 20]: It was so preposterous to compare Mary 's blue serge with Celine 's marvellous concoctions of subtly blended shades .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 12]: `` I 'd make a solemn vow never to wear another !
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 11]: I 'm a great believer in the influence of clothes .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 11]: They account for many of the mysteries of human nature .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 21]: You know how conventional men are , -- how horrified at anything the least bit out of the ordinary rut .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 25]: -- It 's because they have always to wear coats and trousers cut in the same way , out of the same uninteresting cloths !
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 30]: They never know the complete _ bouleversement _ of feeling which a woman experiences every day of her life when she changes from one style of garment to another .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 58]: You put on a blouse and skirt , and you feel active and gamy ; you slip into a tea-gown , and want to talk confidences with a friend ; you put on _ decolletee _ , and feel inclined to flirt , and be frivolous ; you wear a tailor-made costume and -- go to church !
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 8]: Chronic blue serge would depress a saint .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 8]: Do go to Celine , Miss Mallison !
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 8]: Let me send you the address ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 36]: `` I 've not decided to go to Paris , '' Mary said ungraciously , but the next moment she lifted her eyes to Cassandra 's face and gave a weak little smile of apology .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 7]: `` I 've not decided anything .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 7]: Not even where to go first .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 7]: I do n't seem to care .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 17]: You talk about seeing the world , but I do n't particularly want to see it .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 36]: Now that I can go where I choose , I 've been trying to think of an interesting place -- a place that interests me , I mean , but I ca n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 14]: I 've hardly been outside Chumley , and every other place seems unreal .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 21]: I used to long to travel when I was a girl , but I do n't care about it now .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 9]: I 've grown so used to doing nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 14]: Perhaps it may be different now that I have my own money . ''
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 23]: She hesitated for a moment , then questioned tentatively : `` Of course you ... you have always had enough money . ''
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 3]: `` Ye-es !
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 7]: Yes , I suppose I have .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 48]: My father was a poor man for his position , but we had practically everything we wanted , -- horses and carriages , and beautiful gardens , and change when we needed it , and pretty clothes , and -- '' `` And _ space _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 5]: concluded Mary for her .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 55]: `` You have never known what it was to live in a small house where you can never get more than a few yards away from other people , never get out of the sound of their voices , never have a place which you can call your own , except a cold bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 24]: No place where you can _ cry _ without bringing rappings at the door ... That 's why I want to go away .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 9]: I want my money to bring me Space .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 39]: I want to feel alone , with space to do as I like , without thinking of anyone but myself , or even having anyone to check me if I am foolish , and reckless , and mad .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 7]: I expect I shall be reckless .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 16]: It 's a relief sometimes to be able to be reckless , Lady Cassandra ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 12]: `` Oh , Mary Mallison , it _ is _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 3]: cried Cassandra .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 31]: She slipped her hand through the other 's arm , and said warmly , `` I wo n't send you any addresses , I wo n't give you any advice .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 10]: Go away and be as reckless as you can !
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 25]: And when you come back , come and tell me about it , and I 'll rejoice , and not point a single moral .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 11]: It 's in my heart to be reckless too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 20]: `` Thank you , '' said Mary , and there was a note of real gratitude in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 27]: Lady Cassandra was the last person from whom she would have expected understanding , but she did understand , and had even confessed to a fellow-feeling .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 48]: Mary was sufficiently under her mother 's influence to feel that sympathy from the Squire 's wife was doubly valuable , yet she was vaguely disquieted , for what was her new-found money going to procure for her , that was not already in Cassandra 's possession ?
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 18]: If material pleasures palled , would the mere fact of liberty be sufficient to fill her heart ?
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 11]: Was liberty in her case but another term for loneliness ?
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 14]: Mary was silent , feeling as usual that she had nothing to say .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 77]: With arms still linked the two women turned a corner of the path , and found themselves confronted by the Squire and his companions , who were approaching from the farther side ; but now there was a fourth member of the party , for Dane Peignton walked beside his _ fiancee _ , smiling down into her upturned face , and for the moment unobservant of the new-comers , who were still some distance away .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 35]: Cassandra 's hand jerked on Mary 's arm , she was conscious of a rise of colour , and to cover it said quickly : `` Captain Peignton has deigned to appear at last .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 6]: I asked him to lunch .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 12]: Teresa should scold him ... but I suppose they meet constantly .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 9]: Are they to be married quite soon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 32]: She was glad of an opportunity of putting a question which she longed to have answered , but had shirked putting into words , but Mary 's answer was not illuminative .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 6]: `` I hope not . ''
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 14]: Was this an expression of sisterly affection which dreaded the hour of separation ?
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 32]: Cassandra could not decide , and it was too late to question further , for Dane had seen her and was hurrying forward to offer apologies for his non-appearance at lunch .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 25]: Teresa followed and stood by his side , supplementing his explanations with a proprietary air , and Mrs Mallison beamed proudly in the background .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 5]: Quite a family party !
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 35]: She wished certain of the Chumley matrons who were apt to be patronising in their manner , could arrive at this moment , and see her girls the centre of so distinguished a group .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 8]: Cassandra was conscious of an intense irritation .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIXTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 4]: A WILLING CAPTIVE .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 8]: The bulb party pursued its inevitable course .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 45]: The guests arrived in little groups of three and and four , entered the house at the front and made their painful way along highly polished corridors , to a door leading on to the terrace , where Cassandra stood waiting to receive them .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 47]: Here it was the orthodox thing to intercept greetings with ejaculatory exclamations of admiration at the beauty of the floral display , which being done the visitors descended the stone steps , and roamed to and fro , picking up other friends _ en route _ .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 68]: At times the pitiful sun shone out , and then the Chumley matrons unloosed the feather boas which were an inevitable accessory of their toilettes , and confided in one another that it was `` quite balmy , '' and anon it retired behind a cloud , and gave place to an east wind which came whirling round unexpected comers , sharp and keen as a knife .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 36]: Then the matrons thought wistfully of the bountifully spread tea tables which they had discerned through the windows on the terrace , and consulted watch bracelets to see how soon they could hope for relief .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 49]: There were at least ten women present to every man , and entirely feminine groups were to be seen wandering round from one garden to another , for an hour on end , growing ever chillier and more pinched , yet laboriously keeping up an air of enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 49]: Grizel Beverley was the latest guest to appear , having made a compromise with the weather by donning a white dress with a bodice so diaphanous that Martin had informed her he could see her `` thoughts , '' the which she had covered with a sable coat .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 35]: When the sun shone , she threw open the coat , and looked a very incarnation of spring , so white and lacy and daintily exquisite , that coloured costumes became prosaic in contrast .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 40]: When the wind blew , she turned up her big storm collar and peered out between the upstanding points , so snug and smooth and unwrinkled that the pinched faces above the feather boas appeared doubly wan and miserable .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 30]: Feminine Chumley felt it a little hard to be beaten in both events , but bore it the more complacently since it was the bride who was the victor .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 30]: There was no doubt about it , -- Grizel was a success , and already , after but a few months ' residence , Chumley was at her feet .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 28]: She was sometimes `` shocking , '' of course , but as she herself had predicted , the sober townspeople took a fearsome pleasure in her extravagances .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 19]: They were as a dash of cayenne , which lent a flavour to the fare of daily life .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 21]: Moreover , though welcomed with open arms by the county , Grizel was on most intimate terms with the town .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 40]: Invitations to afternoon festivities received unfailing acceptance ; she made extensive toilettes in honour of the occasion , ate appreciative teas , and groaned aloud when she failed to win a prize of the value of half a crown .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 10]: Anything more `` pleasant '' could not be imagined !
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 16]: In the more serious role of parish work also , Grizel had made her debut .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 53]: The Mothers ' Meeting was still waiting time , but one afternoon she had slipped a little gold thimble and a pair of scissors with mother-of-pearl handles into a vanity-bag , and taken her way to a Dorcas meeting at the Vicarage , agreeably expectant of adding a new experience to life .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 26]: The Dorcas meeting was held in the dining-room of the Vicarage , on the long table of which lay formidable piles of calico and flannel .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 19]: At a second small table the churchwarden 's wife turned the handle of a particularly unmelodious sewing machine .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 42]: Over a dozen women sat round the room still wearing their bonnets , but denuded of coats and mantles , and balancing upon their knees some future garment for the poor , at which they sewed with long , rhythmic stitches .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 43]: They were assembled together in a holy cause , and under the more or less holy roof of the Vicar himself , yet the observant eye could have discerned as much hidden worldliness in that room as in the most fashionable assembly .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 23]: At a Dorcas meeting everyone was welcome , the wives of tradesmen as well as representatives of the professional and learned classes .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 31]: It was difficult to keep up the numbers , and since social engagements were less frequent in the former class , its members were able to give more regular attendance .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 15]: The grocer 's wife was a cutter-out with whom no other member could compete .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 29]: She stood at one end of the long table with a length of calico spread out before her , and a pair of gigantic scissors in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 40]: As she cut still further and further into the material , she leant forward over the table , and automatically her left leg swung out , -- a stout , merino-stockinged leg , terminating in a laced leather boot .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 46]: All the members came to her for instructions , and all of them were agreeable and friendly in manner , but when the cutting process was over , she retired to a corner of the room where were congregated a few of her own friends .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 6]: The two classes never mixed .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 26]: Grizel took the work presented to her , -- a full-sized garment of mysterious intent , -- and glanced in questioning fashion round the room .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 35]: The tradesmen 's wives who had been eagerly drinking in the details of her costume , immediately lowered their eyes to their seams , but from every other face beamed a message of invitation .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 56]: Grizel beamed back , but continued her scrutiny , till finally in the furthermost corner she discovered the figure of that lonely parishioner who was neither fish , flesh , nor good red herring , -- Miss Bruce , the retired plumber 's daughter , to whom she had introduced herself at the church decorations .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 18]: She waved her bag with a smile of recognition , and carried a chair to the corner .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 24]: It was not the first time that Chumley had noticed the extraordinary intimacy between Mrs Martin Beverley and `` poor Miss Bruce . ''
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 69]: They had been seen driving together in the country ; Grizel 's car -- a wedding present from one of the relatives who had benefited by her marriage -- had been observed more than once waiting outside the cottage with the green porch , and the little maid had divulged consequentially that the lady `` dropped in now and then , to play cribbage with the missis . ''
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 36]: The Chumley matrons were not in the least inclined to follow the lead , and call upon the plumber 's daughter , neither , to tell the truth , did Miss Bruce desire their attentions .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 16]: She now looked down upon the town , and cherished sneaking ambitions after the county .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 14]: She gave herself airs , and bought an aigrette for her Sunday bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 35]: It is doubtful whether her character was improved by being singled out for such special attention , but at least she was happy , and happiness had been a chary visitor in her life .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 27]: `` This is the first , the very first Dorcas meeting I have ever been to in all my life , '' announced Grizel , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 14]: `` And d'you know I believe it 's my first introduction to calico .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 8]: This is calico , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 3]: Funny smell !
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 6]: I rather like the smell .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 8]: Do people really use it for undies ?
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 16]: Rather , -- just a little -- gritty , -- do n't you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 16]: `` Personally , '' Miss Bruce said primly , `` I do not use calico .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 7]: Not that thread , Mrs Beverley !
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 5]: It 's too fine .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 17]: Let me give you a length ... What has Mrs Thompson given you to make ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 15]: Grizel made a feint of unrolling the calico under cover of an upraised arm .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 17]: `` I should n't wish it mentioned in society , -- but it 's a comby !
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 15]: A comby for a giant , or for a fat woman at a show .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 8]: _ Look _ at the waist width !
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 18]: and I do n't believe she 'll ever be so long from the waist to the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 13]: It will bag over her corsets , and make her back round .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 22]: Could n't I take out a reef in the waist , and join it again with a bit of embroidery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 11]: `` We do n't put embroidery on Dorcas garments . ''
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 4]: `` Never ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 4]: `` Never . ''
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 6]: `` Not the teeniest bit ?
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 6]: Even at the top ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 13]: `` Never ; but the bands are feather-stitched round the neck . ''
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 7]: Grizel adopted an air of severity .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 6]: `` I call it immoral .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 7]: I shall speak to the Vicar .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 10]: No woman can be self-respecting in a calico band !
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 3]: ... Well !
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 12]: can I cut out a piece and join it to itself ?
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 10]: Its against my principles to let it bag . ''
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 9]: `` Mrs Beverley , it wo n't bag !
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 5]: It might with you .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 4]: That 's different .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 18]: Of course if it were for you -- '' Grizel 's eyes opened in a round-eyed stare .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 12]: `` Are n't they the same shape as I am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 7]: Miss Bruce made an unexpected answer .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 56]: She looked the bride over , taking in the graceful lines of the beautiful body which had the slightness of a fay , an almost incredible slightness , but which was yet so rounded and supple that by no possibility could it have been called thin ... She looked , and she shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 11]: `` No , Mrs Beverley , '' she said firmly .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 6]: `` They are not . ''
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 20]: Grizel sewed industriously all afternoon , and on departing exhibited an exquisitely neat seam for Mrs Evans 's inspection .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 9]: `` Never say I ca n't sew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 4]: she said complacently .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 27]: `` This afternoon has taken me back to my childhood , when I used to hem handkerchiefs and bits of finger at the same time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 15]: She pointed dramatically to a small red stain in the middle of the seam .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 7]: `` In more ways than one .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 3]: Human gore !
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 6]: Is n't it piteous ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 7]: Mrs Evans threw a protesting glance .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 4]: `` My dear !
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 3]: What language !
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 9]: ... Very nicely done ; very nicely indeed !
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 5]: An excellent beginning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 23]: She folded up the garment as she spoke , and with a swift movement placed it at the bottom of a pile .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 25]: Not for a contribution towards the Organ Fund would she have betrayed the fact that Grizel had sewed a leg seam to a sleeve !
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 48]: From all sections of the community Grizel Beverley was sure of a welcome , and on the afternoon of the bulb party she had a special reason for being her most charming self , a reason which she had found in the weariness of Cassandra 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 38]: The two friends had descended the terrace steps together , but had separated at the bottom , the hostess to talk to as many of her guests as possible before they adjourned to the house for tea .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 25]: Cassandra was conscious that each group stiffened into attention at her approach , and that natural manners suffered an eclipse while she was present .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 8]: Invariably the same stereotyped remarks were repeated .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 9]: `` How large the hyacinths are this year .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 14]: How charming the blue squills look against the bright yellow of the daffodils .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 14]: The hepaticas are finer than ever ... How very early for iris ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 3]: Cassandra sighed .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 24]: Eight years had she lived among these people , yet she remained the merest acquaintance , while Grizel Beverley was already a friend .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 18]: A month ago she had been proudly indifferent to her own unpopularity , but to-day it hurt .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 23]: She was so overwhelmingly lonely that a craving was upon her for human companionship which in some measure might rill the void .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 60]: She moved about from one group of guests to another , always skilfully turning in an opposite direction when she caught sight of a fair girl in a blue dress , accompanied by a tall man in grey ; until presently , with the feeling of reaching a haven , she found herself alone with the Vicar 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 17]: Mrs Evans looked with concern upon the small , brilliantly coloured face under the fashionable hat .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 23]: She noticed how little flesh there was on the finely modelled cheeks , how sharp cut was the bridge of the nose .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 26]: The girl looked delicate ; she was too thin ; taken in conjunction with the tired eyes , that exquisite flush could not be healthy .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 38]: There was a motherliness in the good woman 's manner which pierced through the crust of dignity as she put her hand through Cassandra 's arm , and said kindly : `` You look tired , dear !
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 13]: I hope you did n't feel cold standing about on the terrace .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 10]: It is exposed , and the wind is chill .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 8]: Are you quite well , Cassandra ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 5]: `` I think so .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 7]: Do n't I look well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 14]: Cassandra felt a relief in the thought that her depression might be physical .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 11]: `` You know I am always unhappy at these functions .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 17]: I am not a good hostess , and it worries me to know what to say .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 12]: I 'm so thankful I 'm not a Vicar 's wife !
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 6]: That must be even worse .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 36]: Does n't it bore you to extinction to be everlastingly two people , -- yourself with your nice natural impulses -- and the Vicar 's wife who has no business to have impulses at all !
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 15]: Does n't it bore you terribly to be always _ ex officio _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 4]: Mrs Evans hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 22]: She intensely wanted to say yes , but that highly trained article , her conscience , would not allow the deception .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 27]: The colour deepened on her large , plain face as she said slowly : `` I _ did _ find it a trial in early years .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 12]: Of late the trial has come to me in another fashion .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 16]: I am perhaps a little too ready to enjoy the importance of my position . ''
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 9]: Cassandra 's laugh rang out with sudden gaiety .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 22]: She gripped the large arm , and said with a charming indulgence : `` Ah , but why should n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 15]: If you _ do _ manage us , it 's for our own good .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 29]: It 's sweet of you to take the trouble ... Mrs Evans , Mary Mallison has been here to lunch , and I 've been talking to her .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 30]: Her mother is vastly excited about this windfall , but the girl herself does not seem capable of anything but relief at the thought of getting away from home .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 10]: I 'm afraid she 's been rather desperately unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 10]: It surprises me that she could suffer so much .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 32]: I thought she was one of those dull women who are contented to jog along in any rut in which they are placed , and never demand anything for themselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 13]: `` Do you think there are any such women , Cassandra ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 6]: `` Do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 10]: `` I am quite sure there are not . ''
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 24]: Cassandra knitted her brows and stared intently into the face of the woman , who was a virtual father confessor to the parish .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 20]: If Mrs Evans were sure , what right had she to question ; but the thought held a sting .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 17]: `` But -- if not , there must be so horribly many who are wretched ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 9]: `` There are , '' Mrs Evans said .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 29]: A moment later : `` Wretched is a strong word , Cassandra , '' she added , `` perhaps it would be better to say ` disappointed . '
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 22]: There are very few women who get to my age who are not making a fight against some sort of disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 31]: They are very brave about it , for the most part , and cover it up so successfully that the world does not suspect ; but the fight goes on .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 15]: I get many peeps behind the scenes ; it 's part of my work .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 19]: Sickness comes or loss , and then it is a comfort to speak out and unburden the heart .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 19]: I 've been amazed at the number of hidden sorrows in the places where I least expected them .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 31]: I have looked down on a woman as frivolous and commonplace , and have come away after half an hour 's confidences looking up to her as a heroine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 13]: Cassandra turned her head and looked up and down the diverging paths .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 25]: Women everywhere , crowds of women , old and young , and heavily middle-aged , talking , smiling , bearing themselves with complacent airs .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 17]: It was a ghastly , a hideous thought that they were all suffering some inner smart !
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 45]: She had believed that she was an exception , but according to Mrs Evans it was not the sufferer who was the exception , but the child of the sunshine , who , like fortunate Grizel , was endowed with the gift of happiness .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 6]: `` All of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 4]: cried Cassandra sharply .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 6]: `` Oh , not all !
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 7]: They look so calm and comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 16]: I could n't bear to think that under the mask they were all suffering ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 12]: `` They are not , my dear ; they are forgetting !
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 26]: That 's the lesson so many of us have to learn , -- to forget the unattainable , and make the best of what remains .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 27]: And every innocent distraction that comes along , like this party to-day , to see your beautiful flowers , helps a step along the road . ''
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 17]: `` Suppose , '' said Cassandra slowly , `` one did not wish to forget ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 8]: The Vicar 's wife shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 5]: `` One rarely does .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 7]: It is easier to cling hold .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 39]: But it 's possible to ask oneself a straight question ... Which is going to make life easier for myself , and the people around me , -- to cling hold , or , -- to let go ?
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 22]: It saps one 's vitality to grieve over the unattainable , and in most lives there _ is _ an unattainable .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 13]: There are not many women so fortunate as you , Cassandra ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 7]: Mrs Evans spoke in good faith .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 28]: She had a sincere liking for the Squire , who as a patron was not only generous , but delightfully free from the dreaded vice of interference .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 22]: When consulted on church matters , he would shrug his shoulders , and declare that it was all one to him .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 34]: So long as the music was passable , and the sermons kept within a ten minutes ' limit , he could be relied upon to give liberally , and to make no complaints .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 7]: Truly a patron in a hundred !
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 12]: Such a man could not fail to be a kind husband .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 36]: Moreover , the touch of snobbishness in Mrs Evans 's nature invested Cassandra 's position in the county with a most satisfying importance , while the presence of the needful heir made the picture complete .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 27]: Youth , beauty , wealth , a fine position , a kindly husband , a strong young son , -- what more could a woman desire ?
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 12]: `` But you must be careful not to take cold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 4]: she added remindfully .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 42]: Cassandra gave a short , mirthless laugh , but before she had time to speak her husband and Grizel turned the corner of the path , and Bernard , with his usual lack of ceremony , beckoned to her to approach .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 22]: He looked flushed and worried , and with a word of apology to Mrs Evans , Cassandra hurried to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 7]: `` Here you are at last !
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 5]: Been searching all over .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 9]: Trust you to hide yourself out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 3]: Look here !
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 7]: I want you at the house .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 6]: There 's been an accident .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 8]: Peignton -- '' Cassandra straightened herself hastily .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 16]: The flower-beds with their blaze of colour whizzed round in kaleidoscopic fashion before her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 8]: She felt very cold , and faint .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 15]: Grizel 's voice sounded a long way off , speaking with a studied distinctness .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 7]: `` A _ slight _ accident !
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 4]: Only his ankle .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 41]: He was doing something in the rockery , clambering over the big stones , and one turned over ... The Squire sent for an old Bath chair in the stables , and he has been wheeled into the plant room .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 12]: There is a terrific discussion going on as to what next .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 15]: Ca n't you come and take away _ some _ of Mrs Mallison ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 20]: Cassandra turned homeward without a word , the Squire walking by her side , waving his hands in excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 13]: `` She wants to drag him home with her in that shandrydan !
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 13]: Says he 'll be lonely at home , and would have Teresa .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 3]: Hang Teresa !
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 26]: There 's a time for all things , -- a man ca n't be bothered with love-making when his foot is giving him blue lightnings .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 9]: Shake him to pieces driving over those roads !
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 14]: Jevons can get him to bed here , and look after him properly .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 25]: I 'll wire to that Swedish fellow to come down , and he 'll have him on his feet in two or three days .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 24]: We 'll put him in the blue room , next to the Den , and he can wheel in on a sofa to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 6]: Now back me up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 7]: `` What does Captain Peignton say ?
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 7]: It is he who must decide .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 11]: He may prefer -- '' `` Oh , rats ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 5]: The Squire waved impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 6]: `` He wo n't prefer .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 4]: What man would ?
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 13]: Teresa 's a fine girl , but that mother is the limit .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 13]: She 'd drive Peignton daft , mewed up in that little house .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 21]: I know what I 'm talking about , -- what you 've got to do is to back me up !
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 9]: You 're always so deuced ready with objections .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 18]: He 's hurt himself here , and he 's going to stay here till he 's better .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 8]: I 've made up my mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 54]: The Squire stormed on , repeating the same things over and over again until the house was reached , and he led the way through a doorway level with the ground into a large , bare room furnished with a couple of chairs , a few cupboards , and a long central table .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 35]: It was a room used by the gardeners for the arrangement of flowers for the house , and had been chosen on the present occasion as offering the easiest access to the Bath chair .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 25]: Cassandra 's eyes darted past a group of female figures and rested on Peignton 's face , pale and drawn , though resolutely composed .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 36]: The realisation that he was suffering put an end to hesitation , and she swept forward , ignoring an opening chorus of explanations , and said firmly : `` His foot ought to be raised .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 8]: It ought to be bathed at once .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 8]: The shoe must be cut off . ''
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 7]: Mrs Mallison was loud in assent .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 12]: `` I said so , Lady Cassandra ; I said so !
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 12]: I 've been talking to him for the last ten minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 7]: _ Folly _ to waste time !
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 17]: The trap is in the stable , and we could be home in half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 12]: I want to take him home with me , Lady Cassandra .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 8]: The best thing , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 17]: So dull for a man with a sprained ankle , ... but he 'd have Teresa .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 5]: Teresa would amuse him .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 8]: Do let me order the trap ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 9]: `` My dear madam , it 's madness .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 9]: The poor beggar ca n't stand a drive .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 25]: He 'd better get off to bed upstairs , and I 'll wire for the Swedish fellow who put me to rights last year .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 15]: My man knows how to start operations , and he can begin right away .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 7]: Marvellous how those Swedes treat sprains !
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 61]: I was laid up a solid six weeks with the same ankle ten years ago under a country G.P. Sprained it again last year , and called in this masseur fellow , and in four days -- '' The Squire was safely launched on a favourite story , staring from one feminine hearer to the other , demanding full attention .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 10]: Cassandra turned her head and looked steadily at Dane .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 16]: She meant that look to be a question , and the question received its answer .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 17]: If ever a man 's eyes expressed appeal , Dane 's expressed it at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 16]: With all the intensity which eyes could express , he threw himself at her mercy .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 16]: `` I think , '' said Cassandra clearly , `` Captain Peignton had better stay .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 8]: It will be quicker in the end .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 10]: Teresa must come up and amuse him here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 14]: She laid her hand on the girl 's arm with a kindly pressure .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 16]: `` You will stay and look after him now , till my husband finds Jevons .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 20]: There is an old carrying chair in the box-room , which will get over the difficulty of the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 3]: Mrs Mallison !
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 9]: shall we lead the way to tea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 13]: The next moment the room was empty save for the engaged pair .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 43]: Teresa knew that the opportunity had been made , and knew that she ought to be grateful , but she was anxious and miserable , and more than a little wounded by her lover 's unwillingness to accept her mother 's invitation .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 14]: `` I should have _ liked _ to nurse you , Dane ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 25]: she said reproachfully , and Dane pressed his lips in a spasm of pain , and rejoined quietly : `` I know , dear .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 11]: Thank you , but it 's better as it is .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 18]: I 'll be confoundedly glad to get this shoe off , and try what sponging will do .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 6]: You 'll come up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 6]: `` Oh , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 3]: Teresa said .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 17]: She leant against the side of the Bath chair , and held out a tentative hand .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 8]: `` I wish it had been me !
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 10]: I 'd rather bear it myself a dozen times .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 21]: It _ will _ help you , wo n't it , Dane , if I come and sit beside you ?
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 19]: If I were ill , I 'd want more than anything else just to see your face ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 6]: `` Bless you , Teresa !
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 21]: You 're a dear girl , '' Dane said , smiling , but his eyes wandered wistfully to the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 5]: The Squire was right .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 10]: A man in pain has no zest for love-making .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 10]: A woman would welcome it with her dying breath .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 2]: REALISATION .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 17]: By nine o'clock in the evening the Swedish masseur had arrived , and begun his manipulations .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 39]: He promised that his patient should walk by the end of five or six days , and at the Squire 's request agreed to put up at the Court for that period , giving several treatments a day .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 22]: His fee made Peignton grimace , but he had to admit that it was cheap in comparison with weeks of inactivity .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 39]: A telephone message brought a couple of bags filled with his clothes and toilette accessories , and he settled down to rest with the satisfaction of a man relieved from pain , and agreeably expectant of the future .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 71]: Raynor was a good fellow ; no one could have been kinder , and it certainly was a comfort to have the services of a trained man at this point , and to be housed in a big establishment , where there were possibilities of moving from room to room on the same floor , or even of being carried up and downstairs without feeling oneself too intolerable a burden .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 21]: There were always two or three lazy fellows hanging about , who would be the better for using their muscles .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 32]: Peignton gave a little shudder of distaste at the thought of the fluster which would have accompanied every movement , if he had accepted Mrs Mallison 's invitation to the Cottage .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 5]: Teresa , dear girl !
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 13]: had offered to nurse him , but the thing was not possible .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 25]: Convention would have forbidden her attending him in bed , and how the deuce was he to get up with no one to help ?
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 18]: He wondered between a laugh and a groan , if Mrs Mallison would have offered motherly services !
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 28]: And then he thought of Cassandra , standing slim and straight , the little deer-like head turned over her shoulder , looking at him with questioning eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 7]: What a picture she had made !
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 8]: Thinking of it conjured up other pictures .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 14]: He envisaged them one by one , as he lay in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 85]: Cassandra on the day of Grizel Beverley 's reception seated beside him in the closed car , the softness of chinchilla beneath her chin ; Cassandra playing bridge , tapping the green baize with the long , lovely hand on which the emerald flashed ; Cassandra at the church decorations standing with upraised arms against a background of leaves ; Cassandra looking at him down the length of her own dining-table , the bare slimness of her throat rising above the bank of flowers .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 12]: Each picture seemed more beautiful , more appealing than the last .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 13]: He wondered dreamily what it was which formed this quality of appeal .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 34]: Was it the touch of physical fragility which underlaid her bloom , or a finer spiritual need which called to a force within his own breast , a force which recognised the call !
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 25]: Always in Cassandra 's presence he had the consciousness of waiting for an opportunity to serve ; always he had the consciousness of need .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 24]: He told himself he would be a happier man if it were ever given to him to be of service to Cassandra Raynor .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 29]: And then , with a real tenderness , he thought of his _ fiancee _ , -- the loving , kind-hearted woman-girl who was to be his wife .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 69]: The mysterious glamour of a Lady Cassandra was far removed from the practical common sense of Teresa Mallison ; but life was largely composed of the commonplace , and he knew that not once , but a hundred times over in the days to come , he would have cause to be thankful for a wife who could be a partner in deed as well as in name .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 22]: He thought of Teresa 's voice as she said : `` I should have liked to nurse you , Dane ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 7]: and felt a pang of remorse .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 8]: He hoped he had not been inconsiderate .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 9]: He hoped the dear girl was not hurt .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 21]: He would write her a line in the morning and explain that ... that really ... Well , hang it !
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 15]: it was simple enough ... There was only one spare room at the Cottage .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 7]: Where could the masseur have slept ?
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 56]: There were many adequate reasons for his choice which he could advance in a letter ; now that he was quietly settled in bed they crowded into his mind , but looking back at the moment of decision , he knew he had acted from no definite reason , but simply from an overpowering desire .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 12]: The chance of staying at the Court had been given him .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 8]: It was not in him to refuse .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 31]: The next morning immediately after his treatment Peignton was wheeled into an upstairs sitting-room , where his couch was placed in a window affording a view of the terraced gardens .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 44]: Cassandra came in dressed for driving , made a few arrangements for his comfort , and immediately disappeared ; later on the Squire lounged in , smoked a pipe , and discussed items in the morning paper , and disappeared in his turn .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 17]: By noon Dane was alone , and the hour and a half before luncheon hung heavily .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 36]: Luncheon was served to him in his room , -- a solitary repast , and the sense of disappointment grew when the table was cleared , and still no one appeared to bear him company .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 48]: Books and papers galore were within reach , an electric bell would at any moment summon an attendant , but a man accustomed to an outdoor life soon wearies of reading , and as minute after minute ticked away , Peignton became conscious of an overpowering impatience .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 19]: He threw down his book , seized the electric bell , and pressed his finger on the button .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 12]: In less than two minutes a manservant appeared in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 9]: `` Is the Squire in the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 8]: `` I am not sure , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 5]: I will enquire . ''
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 10]: `` Ask him to come up , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 7]: Tell him I 'm lonely . ''
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 7]: The man bowed , and retired .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 29]: Five minutes passed , and the sound of light footsteps was heard from without ; the door opened and Cassandra looked at him , smiling under raised brows .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 5]: `` Not asleep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 3]: `` Asleep !
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 7]: Why should I be asleep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 8]: `` Invalids always sleep after lunch . ''
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 7]: `` I 'm not an invalid .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 10]: I 'm a well man tied by the leg .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 21]: I do n't know how a real invalid feels , but I never was further off sleep in my life !
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 12]: I sent to ask the Squire to take pity on me .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 9]: I 'm so confoundedly tired of myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 14]: `` He is out , but Teresa will be here soon after four .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 7]: I invited her to tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 11]: Peignton looked at the clock , and his face fell .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 6]: `` It 's only three .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 11]: There 's an hour and more , before then . ''
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 28]: `` Does that mean that you want -- '' She stopped , smiling , and he answered with eager haste : `` Yes , _ please _ !
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 3]: Could you ?
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 6]: You are not engaged ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 11]: `` Oh , no , I am very seldom engaged .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 10]: I was in my boudoir working at my embroidery .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 9]: I 'll have it brought in here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 26]: She disappeared , to come back a few minutes later followed by a maid carrying an oak stand , which she placed near the couch .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 41]: The stand proved to be the latest improvement in embroidery frames , the stretched work being swung between upright wooden supports , which were connected at their base by a cross-beam , so as to do service as a footstool .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 25]: The while Cassandra selected her chair and a small table for working materials , Peignton peered with awed curiosity at the work in process .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 32]: He beheld what appeared at first sight to be a water-colour painting , the subject a Southern garden , wherein a marble balustrade was overhung by an orange tree in fruit .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 20]: The distance showed a glimpse of a blue lake , against which three dark cypress trees were sharply outlined .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 34]: Beside the balustrade walked the lady of the garden , a stately dame , in a robe of gold-embroidered brocade , ermine lined , and falling open over a petticoat of shimmering blue .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 19]: Her hair was caught in a golden net , she carried in her arms a sheaf of lilies .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 12]: On the ground by her feet fluttered a flock of pigeons .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 30]: Several parts of the background were unfinished , but enough had been done to give the effect of completion , and Peignton 's admiration and astonishment were equally great .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 71]: It was the first example of needlework painting which he had seen , and he was full of interest , craning forward on his seat to watch , while Cassandra seated herself , placed her feet on the cross-board , and tilting the frame to the right angle , plied her silks in quick , sure stitches , holding the right hand above , and the other beneath the frame .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 32]: She was completing a corner of the under-dress , and she showed him how , to gain the desired shot effect , she had twisted together half-threads of green and blue .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 28]: `` It is the most difficult thing in the world to get silks that are indefinite enough to work the little odd bits , '' she explained .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 25]: `` You can get every colour -- exquisite colours , but they are so clear , and strong , and new , and unpicturesque !
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 11]: I have to take refuge in all sorts of dodges .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 44]: I dip the white silks in tea , and coffee , to take off the glare ; and the greys in ink , to make them cloudy , and the rose and blue in acids to tone them down into an old-world softness .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 22]: Sometimes I dye one end of a skein , and leave the other untouched ; that gives quite a good effect .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 32]: I 'm always on the look out for old silks , but they are difficult to find , and the ordinary fancy-work emporium-keeper has not awakened to the needs of pictures .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 27]: When I asked one the other day for a colour to work an old brick wall , she gaped at me as if I were mad .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 26]: However , with cunning and ingenuity , I have managed to collect quite a useful selection ... '' `` You do n't -- excuse me !
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 34]: treat them with much consideration , now that you have got them , '' Peignton said , lifting a tangled mass of colour from the table , and smoothing it with careful fingers .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 32]: `` I remember my mother doing crewel-work in the days of my youth , and having each separate shade run through a kind of tunnel business in a roll of linen .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 14]: You pulled a thread from the roll , and -- there you were !
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 10]: _ They _ never grew matted into balls . ''
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 5]: `` Ah , yes !
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 17]: My mother did too , but -- excuse me , they lacked the real artistic temperament .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 27]: People with real artistic temperaments invariably tangle their silks , if only for the joy of seeing the glorious mass of colour they make matted together .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 24]: Of course , if they chance to possess an idle friend , whose hands are itching for work -- '' `` May I ?
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 6]: Oh , that 's splendid .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 8]: I have a passion for unravelling string .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 11]: This will keep me quiet for quite a long time .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 16]: Tell me what colour you want next , and I 'll coax him out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 5]: `` Green ; blue .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 5]: A strand of each .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 17]: If you like to experiment you can try untwisting them , and mixing the shades . ''
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 38]: Cassandra stitched on , a smile on her lips , but Dane , having extracted the desired threads with unexpected ease , was too much engrossed in watching to make any further effort on his own account .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 16]: The graceful , wholly feminine pose was another picture to add to the mental gallery .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 22]: His eyes followed the sweep of the right hand , and he said involuntarily : `` That 's a beautiful ring !
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 12]: I noticed it the first time I played bridge with you .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 8]: I 've never seen you without it .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 12]: It 's the most beautiful ring I have ever seen . ''
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 18]: She stayed her work to turn her hand and look at the ring with a scrutinising glance .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 9]: `` Yes ; it 's a good stone .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 5]: I like it too .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 11]: It was my mother 's , '' she said calmly .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 15]: There was no consciousness in her face of the beauty of the hand itself .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 11]: The thoughtful look was the result of a puzzling question .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 29]: As Peignton 's admiration for emeralds was so great , why had he not given one to his _ fiancee _ instead of the orthodox row of diamonds ?
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 24]: As though one personal remark called forth another , she turned suddenly to him and asked , `` How did you fall yesterday ?
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 6]: Everyone told a different tale .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 9]: Were you really climbing over the rockery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 4]: `` I was .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 28]: I 'm afraid I did some damage to the bulbs as well as myself , but you had told me that the saxifrages were partial to boots .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 7]: I thought I was perfectly safe .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 25]: I _ was _ , until by bad luck I stepped on to one of those big -- er -- '' `` Clinkers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 5]: `` Clinkers -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 22]: that 's it , and it rolled over and brought me with it , with my foot twisted beneath me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 10]: `` It had probably been put in this year .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 9]: The old , moss-covered stones are safe enough .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 8]: I 'm sorry if I misled you .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 8]: What did you want to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 10]: To her surprise the colour rose in his cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 14]: He took up the tangled silks and smoothed them out with elaborate precaution .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 13]: `` I wanted a sprig of that sweet stuff for my coat .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 12]: The sweet stuff you wore the afternoon we ran away . ''
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 27]: There was a tone in his voice which quickened the beat of Cassandra 's heart , but she shrugged her shoulders with an affectation of resignation .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 11]: `` You are determined to put the blame on me !
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 17]: By your own account I seem to have lured you on by both precept and example .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 13]: What would men do without the poor women to carry the blame ?
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 18]: Bernard is never really consoled about any mishap until he has traced its origin back to me .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 47]: It 's difficult sometimes when it 's some matter connected with the land , about which I know nothing , but he had a bright inspiration about that one day , and declared that things had gone wrong because I _ did n't _ interest myself !
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 17]: If I _ had _ taken an interest , the deal would have been a success !
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 9]: I used to defend myself at one time .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 5]: Now I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 24]: I know that one of the ways I can help him is by letting him work off his irritation by blaming someone else .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 13]: In his heart he knows perfectly well that he is talking nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 8]: At least , I suppose he does !
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 12]: _ I _ always know when I 'm deceiving myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 30]: The blood rushed to her face as she finished speaking , for an inner voice seemed to jeer at the spoken words , to laugh with a saturnine unbelief .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 17]: She hurried breathlessly on : `` In your case , I do really seem to blame .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 5]: I did mislead you .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 14]: I was in a truant mood that afternoon , and forgot my responsibilities .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 18]: You must forgive me , and let me do all I can to help your convalescence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 8]: `` Thanks , '' Peignton said absently .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 6]: He sighed with profound regret .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 8]: `` That summer-house is so far away .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 10]: I sha n't be able to get so far .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 7]: I should have enjoyed another tea .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 7]: What about the Bath chair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 5]: Cassandra shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 9]: `` That summer-house is my own special property .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 13]: I admit a friend on occasion , but never more than one .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 25]: I even put up with tinned milk , rather than let the household know where I disappear for so many of the missing teas .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 22]: If one of the men wheeled your chair for you , there would be no more chance of running away . ''
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 8]: Peignton 's look showed a latent jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 10]: `` Whom have you taken there besides myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 4]: `` Not many .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 10]: One or two only , until the last months .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 9]: Then -- pretty often -- Mrs Beverley . ''
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 8]: The jealousy was still to the fore .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 10]: `` You are very devoted to Mrs Beverley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 10]: `` I 'm thankful to say , I am !
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 13]: I needed a woman friend , and we were friends at once .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 6]: There were no preliminary stages .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 15]: At our second meeting it seemed absurd to address each other by formal titles .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 23]: I knew her better at that early stage , than many of the women who have been my neighbours for years . ''
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 40]: `` I should have thought , '' Peignton said slowly , `` that at this period of her existence Mrs Beverley was too much engrossed with her man to have any interest to spare for an outside friendship . ''
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 8]: The latent grudge sounded in his voice .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 12]: Cassandra discerned it , and turned upon him with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 29]: Without troubling to think why or wherefore , she knew that he was jealous of her intimacy with Grizel , and the knowledge was balm to her soul .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 9]: `` I 'll tell you a secret ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 15]: she said , stopping her work to emphasise her words with uplifted finger . ''
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 10]: _ No _ man can altogether engross a woman !
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 26]: However good , and fine , and tender he may be , there 's still a need within her that only a woman can fill .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 9]: The happiest married woman needs a woman friend .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 11]: The better the husband , the more she needs her .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 10]: A good man is so aggravatingly free from littlenesses .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 33]: He objects to grumbling ; he makes the best of misfortunes ; he refuses to repeat gossip ; he has a tiresome habit of imagining that his wife means everything she says .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 29]: If a woman is to endure a good husband with any resignation , she must have another woman near by with whom she can let herself go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 21]: They laughed together , and Cassandra stretched out her hand for the silks which Dane was smoothing between his palms .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 21]: Just for a moment the two hands touched , but after that moment there followed a pause of mutual self-consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 14]: Cassandra bent her head , unwinding and re-winding her silks with careful deliberation .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 21]: Dane played with the tangled ball , longing , yet not daring to ask what shade would be next required .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 19]: He looked with distaste upon the two separate threads ; wondering how long they would take to work .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 26]: When Cassandra spoke again , she surprised him by a personal question : `` How soon are you to be married , Captain Peignton ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 8]: For a moment he stared in surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 4]: Then he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 7]: `` Apropos of good husbands ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 19]: `` I was not thinking of the connection , but let us hope it _ is _ apropos .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 5]: Soon , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 6]: Men are generally impatient . ''
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 5]: `` Are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 12]: He knit his brows , and appeared to consider the subject .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 10]: `` I do n't know that I am impatient .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 8]: Being engaged is quite a pleasant condition .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 9]: It 's an opportunity of getting thoroughly acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 16]: It does n't seem fair on the girl to rush her into a hasty marriage .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 10]: And in the meantime I have no settled home .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 24]: I could leave the Moat at any time , if there were a sufficient reason , but Paley will be home in autumn .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 10]: I should like to stay on until his return .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 31]: It has fitted in very well for me having the run of the place while he is away , and I do n't want to make a convenience of him .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 42]: He wants me to put up at the Moat over Christmas , and have some hunting , and then , if I can find it , I 'd like a small agency just to add the jam to my own bread .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 10]: Perhaps next spring ... '' A year from now !
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 9]: Cassandra was conscious of mingled dismay and relief .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 14]: A year more of friendship and understanding ; a year more of unrest .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 48]: For her own sake she could not decide whether she were glad or regretful , but she thought of Mrs Mallison and the pile of catalogues on a table when she had paid her visit of congratulation , and from her heart she was sorry for Teresa .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 33]: `` I was engaged for six weeks , '' she said , shrugging , and Dane opened his lips eagerly , choked back the coming words , and mumbled a conventional astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 12]: She longed to know what he had been about to say !
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 34]: For the next half-hour Cassandra stitched steadily at the under-robe of the pictured dame , but Peignton had not another chance of feeling the electric thrill of contact as his fingers met hers .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 18]: She declared that he ruffled the surface of the silks , and insisted upon unravelling for herself .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 10]: At half-past four a manservant announced Teresa 's arrival .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 25]: She had been shown into the drawing-room , and Cassandra rose to go to her , gathering her work materials together on the table .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 38]: Peignton 's eyes were wistful as they followed her movements ; again she had the impression that he was on the point of speaking some eager words , but again he checked himself , and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 14]: `` I will bring Teresa up to you , '' she said quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 12]: `` You will enjoy a talk with her before tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 23]: At five o'clock tea was carried into the Den , and the Squire and Cassandra came in to share in the meal .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 17]: They found Teresa sitting close to the couch , in a somewhat aggressive attitude of possession .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 22]: She had less colour than usual , and her eyes looked tired , and Peignton 's first words concerned her health .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 15]: `` This girl has no business to be out , '' he said kindly .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 8]: `` She is quite hoarse and wheezy .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 13]: I tell her she is a dozen times worse than I am .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 10]: I 'm afraid she has taken a chill . ''
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 17]: `` Oh , Teresa , _ do n't _ be ill after my bulb party ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 3]: Cassandra entreated .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 23]: `` Every year I have a batch of colds on my conscience , and this year there is an ankle thrown in .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 28]: I 'll order the car for you later on , and you must take half a dozen remedies to-night , to nip it in the bud . ''
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 11]: `` It 's no use , '' Teresa said gloomily .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 19]: `` All the remedies in the world wo n't stop my colds when they once get a start .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 31]: They begin on my chest , and work steadily up to my head , and I 'm fit for nothing but a desert island for a week or ten days .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 14]: I came out to-day because I knew it would be my last chance .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 16]: I shall be worse for it , of course ; but I do n't care .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 7]: I had to see Dane . ''
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 24]: cried Peignton with an air of imparting solace , `` if you are going to drive home there is no need to hurry .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 20]: Now that the Squire is in and we are a four , what about a game of bridge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 5]: `` Well thought of !
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 4]: So we will !
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 4]: Good idea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 5]: cried the Squire heartily .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 9]: Teresa smiled ; a thin , artificial smile .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 20]: At seven o'clock Cassandra wrapped her visitor in a warm coat , and walked beside her down the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 36]: During the pauses of the game the wheezing of which Dane had spoken had been distinctly audible , and there was no doubt that the girl was in the initial stage of a chest cold .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 12]: She was low-spirited too , impatient with the contrariety of fate .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 6]: `` Just my luck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 4]: she said crossly .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 22]: `` Now , of all times , when Dane has this tiresome ankle , and needs me to cheer him up .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 15]: A man hates sitting still , and of course you have a hundred engagements .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 17]: If he 'd been with us , I could have amused him all day long . ''
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 23]: `` It would n't have been very amusing for him , if you had been in bed with an attack of bronchitis !
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 9]: It _ is _ hard luck , Teresa .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 11]: But you must nurse yourself , and get better quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 12]: Captain Peignton will soon be able to come to see you .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 11]: Till then , I 'll do everything I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 8]: `` Oh , I know you will .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 3]: Of course .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 6]: You are most awfully kind .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 6]: But _ still _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 4]: cried Teresa eloquently .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 17]: Cassandra went back to her boudoir , and stood face to face with her own thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 19]: What a complex thing was human nature ; how many separate selves went up to make a whole !
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 37]: One part of her was sorry , quite honestly and unfeignedly sorry for Teresa , in that she was debarred from ministering to her lover during his confinement ; another part rejoiced with a ruthless joy .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 29]: For three or four days out of a lifetime , fate had decreed that Dane should be left in her own charge , dependent upon her for society .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 9]: She clutched at her chance with greedy hands .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 8]: `` They are all I shall have .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 18]: I shall have to live on them all my life , '' Cassandra said in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 16]: Then her lips trembled , and she spoke aloud in a low , trembling voice .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 7]: `` I suppose I love him .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 8]: I suppose that 's what it means .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 9]: -- I _ know _ I love him !
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 20]: Oh , Teresa , it wo n't hurt you to spare him to me for just four days ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 5]: OUT OF THE CAGE .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 39]: Teresa 's attack of bronchitis kept her on the sick list for several weeks , and it was not until she was able to go about the house as usual , that Mary found an opportunity for escape .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 93]: Every morning when Mrs Mallison was fresh and vigorous after a night of uninterrupted sleep , she informed the wearied night nurse that no money in the world could be so sweet as the privilege of ministering to a dear one in the hour of suffering : every evening when she was fatigued by the day 's fussings to and fro , she prophesied her own imminent decease , and put it to Mary , as a Christian woman , how she would feel if she took her hand from the yoke !
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 43]: Out of her husband 's hearing also she sang constant laments on the price of patent foods and fresh eggs , and gave instructions that on the first moment of sickening , she herself was to be despatched to the district hospital .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 24]: Teresa , tossing restlessly on her pillows , would interpose an impatient , `` Oh , mother , do n't be silly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 21]: but Mary had relapsed into her old silence , and automatically continued the work in hand , vouchsafing no reply .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 38]: But in her bedroom the big new box was packed ready for flight , and every evening before she went to bed , she took her cheque-book from her desk , and fingered it with reverent touches .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 4]: Everything was ready .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 29]: Quietly and steadily she had made her preparations , and on the morning when Teresa made her first reappearance at breakfast , the last barrier was withdrawn . ''
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 11]: _ So _ nice to be all together again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 5]: Mrs Mallison cried gushingly .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 17]: `` Plenty of fresh air , and you will soon look quite yourself , dear child .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 12]: The Captain would be sad if you lost your pretty colour .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 10]: Mary shall take you a nice walk this morning .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 9]: Elm Road , and round by the larches .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 7]: That will be sunny and sheltered .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 7]: You can start at eleven . ''
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 12]: `` I shall not be able to take Teresa a walk .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 16]: I am going to London this morning by the 10:50 , '' said Mary quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 7]: There was a moment 's silence .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 31]: Teresa bit her lip to repress a laugh , Mrs Mallison , crimson-cheeked , checked herself on the verge of angry words , and cast a glance at her husband .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 19]: `` My dear , '' said the Major courteously , `` I wish you a very pleasant time .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 11]: I will order a fly to take your luggage . ''
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 8]: No one accompanied Mary to the station .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 10]: Mrs Mallison detained Teresa on the score of draughts .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 30]: Everybody knew that stations were the most draughty places in the world ; since there was now no one to help , she herself must take Teresa a walk .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 14]: They could go round by the fish shop , and order a sole .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 24]: Since she was to be left alone to cope with the household , she must get into the habit of fitting things in .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 84]: The Major retired to his study , obviously ill at ease , and reappeared only at the last moment , to peck at his daughter 's cheek with chilly lips , and reiterate , `` My dear , I wish you a pleasant time , '' but Mary caught a glimpse of his bald head at the window as the fly crawled down the lane , and it did not raise her spirits to remember that she had wounded her father 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 38]: That morning , for the first time in her life , Mary travelled in a first-class carriage , an experience far from exciting , since it meant remaining in solitary splendour for the whole of the journey .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 30]: She found little improvement in comfort , but so far from regretting the expenditure of extra shillings , dwelt on it as the only satisfying part of the proceeding .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 48]: It was a real joy to her to have disbursed eighteen shillings , when only six were necessary , for to a woman who has escaped the miser taint , the mere action of spending has a lure , and Mary had counted pennies all her life .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 25]: She sat staring out of the dusty windows , wondering even at this eleventh hour where she should go when she reached her destination .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 28]: The question was not solved , when she found herself seated in a taxi , with the driver 's head peering through the window , awaiting instructions .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 18]: `` Could you -- I want to go to an hotel , a _ good _ hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 42]: It must be very good , but not -- not too fashionable , '' said Mary , with a blush , and the kindly Cockney ran a twinkling glance over her attire , and took in the position in a trice .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 9]: `` You leave it to me , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 17]: I 'll fix you up , '' he said genially , and sprang to his wheel .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 45]: `` Northumberland Avenue 's _ her _ touch , '' he said to himself with a grin , and presently Mary was alighting before a great , gloomy-looking building , and entering a hall which to her inexperienced eyes seemed alarmingly large and luxurious .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 34]: There were groups of people sitting here and there , who had apparently no other occupation but to stare at new-comers ; but after the most cursory glance no one stared at Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 17]: The fashionably attired women averted their eyes with an air of having wasted trouble for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 22]: At the office , the clerk gave the same quick scrutiny , and saw a chance of letting an unpopular room .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 43]: He rang a bell , gave instructions to an underling , and Mary mounted in a lift to inspect a grim , box-like apartment , papered in yellow , from which the nearness of a neighbouring building excluded every ray of sun .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 30]: The smart chambermaid played her part with skill , throwing open the wardrobe , and arranging towels on the stand with a confidence which froze Mary 's objections unsaid .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 18]: Perhaps , after all , there was nothing to say ; perhaps all hotel bedrooms were alike !
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 24]: Mary washed her hands , smoothed her already smooth hair , and betook herself to the great dining-hall where luncheon was in process .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 34]: The room was more than half filled , and the waiter led the way to a table some distance from the door , a dreaded ordeal on which Mary wasted much unnecessary nervousness .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 27]: Despite her experience in the hall , she still dreaded the scrutiny of strange eyes , and in imagination felt herself the observed of all observers .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 31]: A strange figure in Chumley High Street attracted general curiosity ; to walk up the church aisle in a new dress , was to hear every pew creak behind one .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 40]: At the private hotels which she had visited at the seaside , the arrival of a new inmate roused the whole establishment to animation ; to a lesser extent Mary was prepared to be of importance in London also .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 7]: But no one looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 50]: Not a single head turned as she trotted with short , nervous steps in the wake of the foreign waiter ; when , tentatively , she lifted her eyes from her plate , diners to right and left were consuming their food with an utter disregard of her presence .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 23]: Mary took courage , and began to look about on her own account ; presently she realised that no courage was required .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 19]: Seated in the midst of a crowd she was virtually as much alone as on a desert island .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 13]: After lunch she dressed herself , and went out into the street .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 28]: On the broad outer step of the hotel she hesitated , uncertain in which direction to turn , and the porter enquired if she wished a taxi .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 39]: It seemed easier to assent than refuse , so she allowed herself to be assisted into the tonneau of a passing car , and for the second time that day faced the problem of deciding where to go .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 25]: The reflection of her own hat in a strip of mirror settled the question , -- the hat which had aged unaccountably since morning !
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 26]: She directed the man to drive to a good milliner 's , and was set down before the door of a noted robber in head-gear .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 9]: The next half-hour was a nightmare of discomfort .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 25]: It began with the opening of the swing door , and the view into the luxurious , the terrifying luxurious _ salon _ within .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 36]: The floor was covered with the softest of carpets , cushioned lounges were set round the walls , reflected in mirrors were the figures of nymph-like forms , with wonderful coiffures of gold and auburn .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 21]: The same mirrors reflected the small , navy-blue figure standing in the doorway , and the contrast was not encouraging .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 33]: One of the nymphs floated forward , bowed Mary to a chair , and took off her hat and veil , the which she placed in horrible conspicuousness on a marble-topped table .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 23]: This done she floated away , leaving Mary to face her own reflection , and give surreptitious touches to her flattened locks .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 27]: Never had she harboured any delusions about her own appearance , but it had remained for that moment to show her the extent of her limitations .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 24]: When the nymph came back she bore in her hand a helmet erection , from which two brush-like feathers protruded at unexpected angles .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 24]: Mary 's exclamation expressed unmitigated distaste , but the nymph was plainly accustomed to such manifestations , and not to be discouraged thereby .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 30]: She merely proceeded to drop it in place , like a basin covering a mould , remarking in airy tones that `` it looked different on the head . ''
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 3]: It did .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 48]: Sheer horror at her own appearance gave Mary strength to tear it off , and declare that nothing would induce her to be seen in such a monstrosity , whereupon the nymph smiled with an ineffable forbearance , and produced another model more exaggerated than the first .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 25]: It was during the sixth sortie for fresh supplies that Mary seized her own hat , and thrust in the pins with feverish haste .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 10]: Not another moment would she remain to be tortured .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 21]: Was not her mind already stored with six nightmare portraits of her own visage , staring horror-stricken beneath preposterous erections ?
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 37]: She would say that she was pressed for time ; that she would call again ; that she was sorry that she cared for nothing ... but the nymph on returning allowed no time for explanations .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 31]: She exhibited no surprise at the visible signs of the customer 's revolt ; it appeared indeed that she was prepared for their appearance , and for her own counter-movement .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 65]: She wheeled round , sent a Marconi signal towards the far end of the room , and from behind the shelter of a screen stepped a new and formidable apparition , that of a woman of middle age , of more than middle age , for beneath the elaborate coiffure of golden hair , the large , chalk-white face was deeply lined and furrowed .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 20]: It was a horrible face , hiding beneath a stereotyped smile the marks of a cruel , unprincipled soul .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 21]: To Mary 's country-bred eyes there was something inhuman not only in the face , but also in the figure .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 26]: The enormous bust was moulded into a sheath of black satin , and thence to the hips the body presented a straight , unbending line .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 47]: The effect was like the trunk of a tree , rather than that of a woman , -- solid , shapeless , unyielding , and the tightness about the lower limbs , the smallness of the silk-shod feet , added to the unnaturalness of the effect .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 59]: Mary realised at once that she was in the presence of the august head of the establishment , and felt courage ooze from every pore , and in truth she was helpless as a fly in the hands of this woman , whose work in life consisted in bullying her customers into buying what they did not desire .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 17]: Madame approached , took up her position by Mary 's side , and began to speak .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 18]: Her tone was honey , and her words were soft , but the meaning thereof was plain .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 15]: `` You do n't find a hat that suits you , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 8]: ... Did you imagine that you would ?
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 13]: ... Look in that glass , and see yourself as you are !
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 31]: -- I have here the best selection of models in town , and if you are not satisfied , it is your taste that is to blame , not mine .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 19]: I do not employ a staff of assistants to have their time wasted by the like of you .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 15]: Out of this shop you do not go until you have paid the price !
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 11]: Make your choice , and be quick about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 16]: Mary made no attempt to rebel ; she knew too well that she was beaten .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 36]: She bought the least exaggerated of the models , paid down a cool four guineas , and emerged into the freshness of the outer air with the feeling of one escaping from a noisome animal .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 15]: Never in her life had she beheld a woman so repellent , so terrible .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 22]: She thought of the fate of the young girls who were caged up with her all day long , and shivered .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 20]: She wondered of what fibre were those other women , through whose patronage such a harpy lived and prospered .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 21]: She hoped , for the credit of the sex , that the majority of customers were casuals , like herself !
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 19]: For the next hour Mary wandered to and fro , finding interest in the study of shop windows .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 61]: At first she made her pauses in tentative fashion , for she had heard lurid stories of the dangers of London streets , and went in fear of a tall , gentlemanly-looking individual who would suddenly appear out of space , and whisper in her ear , requesting to be allowed to buy her a dress , or a blouse .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 41]: Such incidents had happened to girls of her acquaintance ; she distinctly remembered the horror and perturbation with which they had related the details , but it appeared that there was no such molestation to be expected in her case .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 12]: She remained as unnoticed as in the dining-room of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 20]: At four o'clock she retired into a confectioner 's shop , and refreshed herself by a daintily served tea .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 59]: The room was empty , but as time went on the scattered tables filled up one by one , mostly with young couples , the men tall and immaculately groomed , but far from manly in expression ; the girls attractive , despite their handicap of fashionable garments , in an age when grace is a forgotten joy .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 35]: They looked a different race from the girls who paced daily up and down the Chumley High Street , and Mary , beholding them , felt a dawning of interest in her four-guinea hat .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 24]: It was at least a becoming colour , and the feather was a beauty , -- so thick and long and gracefully curved .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 23]: Reduced in height , pressed into a less noticeable shape , the hat might turn out not a discreditable purchase after all .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 29]: She felt a distinct relief at the thought that after to-day she would see the reflection of that blue feather in the innumerable mirrors which lined the streets .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 24]: After tea Mary went into the Park and sat on a chair , watching the stream of fashionable life flow to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 32]: She wished she had someone with her to explain who was who , and was on the whole disappointed with the appearance of the crowd , but the flowers were beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 19]: She determined to come again in the morning , and enjoy the flowers undisturbed by the bustling crowd .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 30]: All the chairs were occupied ; the moment that they were vacated they were instantly seized by other loiterers , who appeared to have been waiting for the chance .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 23]: A man and woman seated themselves by Mary 's side , and fell into conversation with an absolute disregard of her presence .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 21]: A few moments sufficed to prove that they were husband and wife , but they belonged to widely different types .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 15]: The woman had a worn , handsome face , and a figure fashionably attenuated .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 23]: She was faultlessly attired , and with a royal disregard of cost , but both voice and manner betrayed a ceaseless discontent .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 52]: Every word was a grumble in disguise , reference to events past and to come were invariably supplemented by protestations of being `` bored to death , '' and all the time the big , jovial-looking husband smiled , and soothed , and skilfully steered the way on to subjects new .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 49]: There was no effort in his air ; if there had been a time when his wife 's grumblings had power to distress him , that time was past , now the tricklings of the thin voice flowed off him , like water from a duck 's back .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 9]: He listened , laughed , and began again .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 22]: Mary realised with a thrill of surprise that this man actually loved the bundle of nerves whom he called his wife .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 7]: There was no mistaking the fact .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 21]: There was love in his voice , in his face , in the sound of the deep , kindly laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 15]: He loved her , was proud of her , found pleasure in her society .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 65]: She watched the couple move away at the end of a quarter of an hour , the wife languidly leading the way through the crowd , the man following , his eyes bent on her in proud approval , and afterwards for long minutes she sat pondering on the nature of the tie which held a man 's heart faithful to such a mate .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 29]: Was it the remembrance of a past , before years and gold had left their mark , -- a past so sweet that it lived in undying memory ?
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 36]: Was it that beneath an outer querulousness of manner there still lingered recurrences of tenderness , of passion , which kept alight old fires , -- was it simply that the man did not feel ?
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 19]: `` If _ I _ had a husband -- If he had cared for _ me _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 9]: Mary repeated to herself for the thousandth time .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 28]: The sentence never reached a conclusion , it was simply an exclamation of amazement that a woman should be blessed with love , and yet know discontent .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 20]: She sat on until the crowd began to diminish , and the rows of chairs to show empty spaces .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 15]: There was nothing else to do , and the hotel bedroom made no appeal .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 41]: Already it seemed days since she had left Chumley ; she calculated how much money she had already spent , multiplied it , to discover what rate of expenditure per annum was represented , and was startled by the result .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 13]: Perhaps it would be wise not to take a regular dinner to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 10]: After such an extensive lunch she was not hungry .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 9]: She decided on a cutlet in the restaurant .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 14]: Later on , on rising from her chair Mary received a severe shock .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 5]: Her sunshade had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 23]: It was a new one , a birthday present from the family ; navy-blue silk , with a handle topped with gold .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 35]: She had rested it in all confidence against the back of her seat , and now ... With flushing cheeks she recalled the different people who had occupied the chair next to her own .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 45]: The jovial husband , an elderly woman in black , with a rope of pearls to match large solitaire earrings ; a pretty flapper in white ; a young girl , fashionably attired , with cheeks suspiciously pink ; one or two young men .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 22]: It was not possible , it was not conceivable , that one of the number could have stolen a modest sunshade !
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 15]: But the sunshade had disappeared -- no trace of it was to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 10]: Mary told herself that there had been a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 9]: Some woman had picked it up without thinking .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 6]: How sorry she would be !
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 14]: When she reached the hotel the hat box was waiting in her bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 14]: She opened it , and took the hat to the window to examine .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 6]: The first feeling was disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 21]: She had believed the feather to be much handsomer , -- softer , longer , of a more delicate shade .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 11]: She held it up , regarding it with puzzled eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 10]: How had she come by so mistaken an impression ?
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 11]: Finally she decided that it was a question of light .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 12]: She sighed patiently , and returned the hat to its box .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINETEEN .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 2]: ADRIFT .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 17]: Mary spent a week in the London hotel , the longest week she had ever known .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 32]: She rose late , and went to bed early , nevertheless the days stretched to an interminable length , and she was driven to extraordinary devices to get through the hours .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 63]: One day , attracted by a line of flaring posters , she spent the morning in a Turkish bath ; another afternoon she drifted into a barber 's shop and had her hair waved and coiffured , a process which so altered her appearance that she hurried to a similar establishment a few hundred yards away , and underwent a drastic shampoo .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 25]: Another day , after lunching in the restaurant of a great store , she whiled away half an hour by having her nails manicured .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 40]: From morning till night no one noticed her , no one spoke to her , she herself had no need to speak , yet all around was a babel of tongues , an endless , ever-passing stream of fellow-creatures .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 32]: If she had felt herself superfluous in Chumley , the feeling was accentuated a thousand times in this metropolis of the world , wherein she walked as on a desert island .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 23]: And yet , through all the desolation of soul pierced golden moments , when the sense of freedom filled her with joy .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 62]: To be able to rest without comment or questioning ; to rise in the morning , and retire to bed , according to preference , not rule ; to choose her own food , to go out , or stay within , as fancy prompted , -- such simple matters as these came as happy novelties to the woman of thirty-two .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 25]: Mary had despatched a post card announcing her arrival , and giving the address of her hotel but she received no message in reply .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 18]: Mrs Mallison was on her dignity , and would wait until she had received an orthodox letter .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 11]: The Major never wrote , and Teresa presumably was busy .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 31]: For a week or more the silence caused Mary no trouble , but by that time the continued silence of her life awoke the exile longing for news from home .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 20]: She despatched a colourless letter , filling with difficulty three sides of a sheet , and waited the result .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 18]: It came , according to her happiest hopes , in the shape of a missive from Teresa .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 26]: `` Dear old Mary , `` I hope you are enjoying your liberty as much as you expected , and having a real good time .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 8]: It 's pretty strenuous here without you .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 21]: I am running about all day long , and being instructed meantime to lie down , and take things easy !
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 11]: I never in my life felt so irritated and depressed .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 30]: It 's borne in on me , old thing , that you have been a buffer between me , and -- er -- shall we say _ circumstances _ ?
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 12]: and that I never appreciated you properly until you had gone !
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 10]: `` You do n't say much about your doings .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 7]: Do you go to the theatres ?
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 19]: I suppose you can go to matinees , if it is n't proper to go alone at night .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 6]: Have you bought any clothes ?
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 29]: You might look out for an evening dress for me -- white or pink -- not blue this time , and not more than three or four pounds .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 16]: The Raynors and Beverleys have taken a house together at the sea near good links .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 34]: Dane is to join them for part of the time , and I am asked for a day or two at the end of his visit , so I need a new dress .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 7]: The invitation came from Mrs Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 13]: I have n't once been asked to the Court since you left .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 13]: Lady Cassandra is dropping me now that she has her beloved Grizel .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 11]: Altogether I think her behaviour is rather _ queer _ .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 42]: You would have thought , after Dane staying there over a week , and getting so intimate , as they must have done , that he would at least have been asked to tea since he left , but not once !
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 10]: I asked him straight out , so I know .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 17]: He wo n't acknowledge that he thinks it odd -- you know how close men are .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 11]: -- but I can see he does from his manner .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 10]: I shall go to Gled Bay for his sake .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 9]: He would be so disappointed if I refused .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 20]: He has given me a gold bangle , just the sort I like : a plain , flat band .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 5]: He looks thin still .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 12]: Mother thinks he worried a great deal while I was ill .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 16]: Of course it was hard for him being tied by the leg -LRB- literally ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 11]: , and not able to do a thing for me .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 13]: Dane does n't say much , but his feelings are awfully deep .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 15]: `` I wonder if it is n't a mistake to conceal one 's feelings ?
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 9]: I 'm beginning to think that it is .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 22]: We have been brought up to be undemonstrative , but if I have children , I 'll teach them quite differently .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 24]: What 's the good of thinking nice things in your heart , if the person you care for does n't get the benefit ?
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 2]: Mary !
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 11]: I 'm sorry I have n't been nicer to you .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 14]: I 'm sorry I was selfish , and let you do so much .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 17]: If it 's any satisfaction to you to know it , I 'm paying up now !
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 11]: I do hope Dane will want to be married soon .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 11]: I do n't think I can last out much longer .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 25]: I have thought so often of what you told me the night we were engaged , about your own love story , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 13]: How could you bear it , and live quietly on at home ?
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 4]: I could n't .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 14]: If Dane treated me like that , I should -- marry Mr Hunter !
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 12]: I 'd like to see your face when you read that !
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 5]: But it 's true .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 16]: Much more sensible , too , than the river , or growing sour at home !
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 3]: `` Good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 3]: Write soon .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 9]: `` Your affectionate sister , `` Teresa . ''
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 20]: Mary put the letter back in its envelope , and went out to look for Teresa 's evening dress .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 24]: She paid for it out of her own money , and decided to offer it in the shape of an advance birthday present .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 21]: In any case she would have to give something in October ; it might just as well be bought now .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 22]: She experienced a torpid satisfaction in the transaction , but it soon faded , and left her mind empty as before .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 9]: Teresa 's appreciation and affection came too late .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 17]: Five years ago they might have transformed her life , but they had not been given .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 13]: Of what use to offer them now when their lives lay apart ?
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 19]: Speculations as to Lady Cassandra Raynor , even as to Peignton himself , aroused no flicker of interest .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 17]: They had been mummers in a play , and she had escaped into the open air .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 21]: The only person of whom she had cared to hear was her father , and concerning him Teresa was mute .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 8]: Another week passed , and still another .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 19]: Mary left the big hotel , and moved into a smaller one , of the glorified boarding-house type .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 72]: Here , if she had chosen , she might have been less lonely , for there were half a dozen solitary women like herself , who would have been glad to include her in games of cards , or to exchange confidences over afternoon tea , but Mary had played a duty game of whist every week night for a dozen years , and had vowed never to touch another card .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 25]: Moreover , she shrank from the furious curiosity of these women , who seemed capable of asking personal questions for hours at a time .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 45]: She left the boarding-house and took furnished apartments , but the hot weather came on with a rush , and the rooms grew stuffy and breathless , so for the third time she was faced with the problem , of where to go next .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 33]: One afternoon she sat at tea at one of the little tables belonging to the outdoor restaurant near Victoria Gate , and essayed the difficult task of making up her own mind .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 23]: In a limited sense the world was before her , but the very largeness of the choice made it the more difficult .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 17]: If she could but think of something which interested ... something for which she really cared !
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 20]: No answer came to the question , yet of a certainty she was happier under some conditions than others .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 31]: Looking back over the blank stretch of days , there were hours which stood out from the rest , hours in which she had felt restful , -- almost content .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 13]: Mary lived those hours , trying to draw from them a conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 23]: There were hours spent in the Park , not in the afternoon , but the morning , when it was comparatively empty .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 27]: The rhododendrons were in full bloom in the beds near Rotten Row ; she heard people say that they had never been finer than this year .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 63]: There had been other hours in the Abbey , both during the services and after ; there had been an afternoon on an excursion steamer plying up the river to Oxford ; and a drive on the top of an omnibus on a misty night , when the lights twinkled in softened radiance , and the great buildings assumed a mysterious splendour .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 17]: One by one , Mary recalled the hours , but the conclusion could not be found .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 20]: Then suddenly her ears were opened to a woman 's voice talking at the table next to her own .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 8]: `` Switzerland , '' she was saying .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 4]: `` Of course !
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 8]: As soon as I can run away .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 9]: I am longing for the time to come .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 28]: I have been there every summer for the last ten years , and if it rests with me , I shall go every year till I die .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 28]: I 've tried Norway , I 've tried the Tyrol , but I 've gone back to my old love , and I shall never wander again .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 7]: Switzerland gives me what I need .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 8]: I go there and feed upon it .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 18]: It 's the tonic that braces me up for another year of hard , ugly life . ''
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 23]: There was a moment 's silence , then another voice asked : `` But what exactly _ do _ you feed on ?
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 14]: What is the name of the tonic which helps you so much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 4]: `` Beauty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 5]: said the woman deeply .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 8]: The blood rushed to Mary 's cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 6]: She had found her clue !
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 10]: That word showed her the secret of her heart .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 19]: All her life she had fed on prose ; now unconsciously she was craving the tonic of beauty .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 19]: It had been beauty in one form or another , which had brought her few hours of content .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 15]: The next morning she packed her box , and took a ticket for Berne .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWENTY .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 2]: BARRIERS .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 46]: The house at Gled Bay was situated at some distance from the cliff , which was the spot most desired by its female tenants , but at the very gates of the golf links , which presented the be-all of existence to the two men .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 34]: It was one of the aggressively new-looking edifices , which the house-hunters of to-day regard with dismay , protesting with unnecessary violence that nothing would induce them to make so prosaic a choice .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 6]: That is stage number one .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 29]: Stage number two consists in an inspection of cheerful rooms , wide windows , and sunny balconies , and a grudging admission that new houses have their points .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 35]: Stage number three follows hard on the discovery of rats in the kitchen of the panelled house of dreams , and consists in a sceptical wonder if the villa could possibly `` do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 17]: Stage number four marks the signing of a lease , and the planting of innumerable creepers .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 52]: In the case of the villa rented by Martin and the Squire in conjunction , the creepers had already mounted to the second story , so that it was possible to pick roses out of bedroom windows , and forget the glaring brick and imitation timber hidden beneath the clustering leaves .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 51]: Cassandra and Grizel had rooms which opened on the same balcony , and there was a covered verandah which ran the length of the south side of the house , in the shade of which they partook of tea together , what time their lords were absent on the links .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 14]: The mental attitude of the two women towards the masculine absorption differed naturally .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 22]: Cassandra was unfeignedly thankful to have her husband kept in good temper , and to be left alone to amuse herself .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 55]: Grizel began each morning in a mood of exemplary unselfishness , rejoiced in the prospect of healthful exercise for her student , and speeded him on his course with the sunniest of smiles , but when tea-time brought no sign of return , her eyes showed sparks of light , and her lips tightened .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 57]: _ This _ meant that the men had started on a third round , and would not appear until six , at which hour they would be graciously pleased to repose themselves on the verandah , drink cooling draughts , and smile benignly upon waiting wives , until it should be time to dress for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 37]: On such occasions it was Grizel 's habit to leave the house shortly before six o'clock and start on an hour 's walk over the country in a directly opposite direction to that of the links .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 58]: If a man elected to spend the whole day apart from his wife , -- if he found his pleasure in so doing ... far be it from her to say him nay , but on his return she would not be found sitting in an appointed place , meekly awaiting the light of his countenance . ''
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 14]: _ That _ smacks too much of the harem for my taste ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 7]: quoth Mistress Grizel with a shrug .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 43]: These perverse excursions invariably ended in a pursuit by a tired Martin , when Grizel would be inwardly overwhelmed with remorse , and would make vows of forbearance for the future , which vows were fated to be broken with all speed .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 25]: A state of mind for which no excuse is offered , but which is commended to the sympathy of the wives of golfing bridegrooms !
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 33]: Sometimes Cassandra disappeared for long walks on her own account , and Grizel realised that she went forth to wrestle in solitude for a medicine of which her soul was in need .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 21]: She was a restless Cassandra in these days , sometimes moody , often irritable , and anon almost obtrusively gay .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 42]: For all their intimacy Grizel had a consciousness of being kept at a mental distance , or whenever their talks together took a deeper turn , Cassandra was ready with a laugh or jest to switch it back into light impersonality .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 14]: So does a man with a maimed limb instinctively shield it from touch .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 21]: Thus the first fortnight passed by , and brought the day when Dane Peignton was due to make his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 33]: He arrived at tea-time , looking tired and pale beside the tanned golfers , who had shortened their day in his honour , and were not above letting him realise their generosity .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 52]: They were too pleasantly engaged describing the crack strokes of the day , to allow the new-comer much chance of speaking , but he had an air of abundant content as he drank his tea , vouchsafed appreciative murmurs of admiration , and took in the charming details of the scene .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 15]: Grizel , as hostess _ ex officio _ , presided at the tea table .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 16]: The two women had discussed the question of housekeeping during the joint month 's tenancy .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 7]: Who should be the nominal head ?
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 5]: Who should give orders ?
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 7]: To whom should the servants apply ?
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 26]: Since to possess two mistresses was anathema to everything in cap and apron , it was evident one must sacrifice herself for the common good .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 27]: `` It had better be me , then , '' Grizel said , shrugging , `` for I sha n't worry , and you will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 25]: and Cassandra shrugged in her turn , and added , `` Also if things go wrong , Bernard wo n't growl at you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 7]: And so the matter was arranged .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 50]: Cassandra 's swing chair was drawn close enough to the rails of the verandah to allow the rays of the sun to touch her hair as she tilted gently to and fro , and give an added lustre to the points of gold in the thick , wreath-like braid .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 47]: She wore a white dress , which to masculine eyes appeared the acme of simplicity , and Peignton , watching her , believed that the style of coiffure and dress alike was the outward proof of inward simpleness of heart , and lack of feminine vanity .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 5]: Wherein he was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 25]: After the first greeting he had never directly addressed himself to Cassandra , but his eyes wandered continually towards the white , swinging figure .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 18]: `` We 've fixed up your game all right , Peignton , '' the Squire informed him .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 18]: `` Found a decent fellow at the club , who 's keen to make up a foursome .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 10]: I think you can give him about two strokes .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 10]: He 's to meet us to-morrow at ten o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 11]: We ought to get in some good days before Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 15]: Of course when the fair Teresa arrives you 'll want to knock off . ''
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 6]: Grizel made an expressive grimace .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 12]: `` Seeing that she is -- _ not _ his wife !
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 16]: Oh , matrimony , where are the charms our mothers have seen in thy face ?
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 10]: There ought to be a second line to that .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 24]: -- La la la , -- la la la , la la la _ La _ ... since golf has taken our place !
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 13]: I shall have a word to say in Teresa 's ear . ''
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 5]: `` No use ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 5]: cried Peignton , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 8]: `` She 's caught the fever herself .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 5]: No small player either .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 12]: The first time I met her was on the golf links .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 22]: She wo n't have the usual plea of desertion , as we shall probably spend our spare time playing together . ''
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 8]: `` Community of interests , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 7]: The Squire made a wry face .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 21]: `` Very idyllic , no doubt , but I 'm not keen on a wife as a partner at golf .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 23]: Cassandra ca n't bit a ball to save her life , and I 've always thought it one of her chief virtues .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 11]: Women are the deuce when they fancy themselves at games .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 10]: I gave up tennis parties for that very reason .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 15]: Never do more now than ask up three other fellows to make a four .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 9]: Girls are all very well in their place .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 20]: I like girls , but I 'd choose a man every time when it comes to a game . ''
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 11]: Grizel cocked her head at him with a challenging air .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 21]: `` What do you bet I do n't beat you hollow at croquet , before the clock strikes seven ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 3]: `` Nothing !
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 7]: Ai n't going to play . ''
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 13]: `` Oh , yes , you are , '' Grizel said coolly .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 20]: `` You 've been amusing yourself all day ; now you are going to amuse me for a change .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 27]: Croquet is about the only game I _ can _ play , and I have a fancy that it would do you good to be beaten .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 7]: Does anyone want any more tea ?
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 15]: They ca n't have it if they do , for there 's none left .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 10]: Anyway , you 've all had three cups . ''
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 9]: She held out her arm in mocking fashion .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 9]: `` Come along , and be butchered ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 7]: The Squire shrugged , and submitted .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 9]: `` That 's all right , Mrs Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 2]: Delighted .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 33]: Never said I objected to other fellows ' wives ... '' They moved off round the corner of the house ; Martin glanced after them , yawned , and stretched his legs .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 28]: In Grizel 's absence he became very conscious of his tired body , and the two hours which had still to elapse before dinner assumed formidable proportions .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 70]: It entered his head to excuse himself and retire to his own room , for a read , followed by a leisurely bath , then he remembered his duties as host , and resigned himself to stay at his post , and his two companions , noticing his sigh and yawn , read his thoughts as a book , and waited in a tensity of suspense for his decision .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 71]: Peignton was in no doubt as to his own feelings , -- he longed with all his heart for the fellow to take himself off , and leave him to talk to Cassandra alone ; Cassandra believed that she wished precisely the opposite , but to both came the same sharp pang of disappointment , as Martin took out his cigarette case , and settled himself in a lounge chair .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 17]: After a quarter of an hour 's casual conversation Cassandra rose , and entered the house .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 41]: She felt too impatient to continue the three-sided conversation , but , inside the drawing-room , she lingered on pretence of rearranging the flowers in the tall green vases , while her ears strained to hear what was happening without .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 29]: If Dane cared enough to follow , it would be so easy , so natural , to ask to be taken a walk of inspection round the gardens !
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 65]: Those minutes of waiting had been sufficient to prove the fallacy of her pretence , and she knew that she was hungering for the time when they should be alone together , when she could look into his eyes , and hear his voice speaking in the deep , full tones which had made music in her ears during the stolen days of convalescence .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 20]: She had gone hungry for weeks , and for a moment it had seemed that she might be fed .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 14]: If only Martin had obeyed his first impulse , and taken himself away !
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 13]: She stayed her hand , and stood motionless listening with strained ears .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 21]: From the balcony without came the sound of a masculine voice , running on in a smooth , even flow .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 26]: The feminine element being withdrawn , Martin had embarked on a serious discussion which sounded as if it might be prolonged to an interminable length .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 8]: At that moment Cassandra hated Martin Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 30]: Half an hour later , from an upper window which gave a view of the verandah , Cassandra beheld the two men playing chess with every appearance of absorption .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 17]: After dinner , bridge occupied the hours till bedtime , the men cutting in and out .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 24]: The next day they disappeared from ten until six , and after being fed and refreshed , were keen for bridge once more .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 20]: The Squire was keen , that is to say , and the others acquiesced with more or less readiness .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 12]: The second and third days brought little variation in the programme .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 34]: The golfers arrived home a little later , a little earlier , sat smoking and talking on the verandah , or rested their limbs , and occupied their brains with contests at chess .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 8]: Frequently Martin disappeared to his own room .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 57]: He had some short articles on hand , which he was anxious to finish ; moreover , being accustomed to long hours in his study , he grew weary of the sound of voices , and felt at liberty to take an occasional hour of solitude , now that the Squire was provided with a companion .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 15]: So it came about that Dane could never count upon ten minutes to himself .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 76]: In the short part of the day which he spent in the villa , he was continually shadowed by the Squire 's big , bronzed presence ; the big voice boomed continually in his ear , challenging him to fresh contests , haranguing on politics , laying down the law on the eternal subject of land , and with every hour that passed , there grew in Dane 's breast a smouldering fire of rebellion .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 20]: The time was passing , was flying fast ; he had the feeling of being continually baffled and outflanked .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 24]: In another two days Teresa would arrive , and her coming seemed to mark the end of , -- of _ what _ ?
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 71]: Peignton did not acknowledge to himself in so many words that he was crazed with disappointment at the impossibility of spending five uninterrupted minutes in Cassandra 's company ; it was easier to skirt round the subject , and declare that he was tired of golf , bored with the Squire 's eternal bluster , yet reluctant to approach the end of a visit from which he had expected much .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 25]: As he was dressing in the morning he debated how he could escape from the links , but the solution was difficult to find .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 17]: Each day 's game was arranged in advance , his own willingness being taken for granted .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 13]: Had he not been invited for the special purpose of playing golf ?
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 25]: Again , if in the evening he were to cry off bridge , it would simply mean that Cassandra was chained to the table .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 45]: The only chance of a _ tete-a-tete _ lay during the interval between the return from the links and the serving of dinner , and so persistently was fate against him at those times , that Dane began to suspect an abetting human agency .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 11]: Not the Squire , not Martin , but Grizel herself !
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 27]: It did not seem possible that it was owing to chance alone that the pawns on the board were so consistently moved to block his approach !
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 34]: There is nothing so irritating to the nerves as the fret of continual disappointment , and in both looks and manner Peignton showed signs of the mental strain through which he was passing .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 24]: Cheerfulness forsook him , he grew silent and preoccupied , only by the hardest struggle did he prevent an outburst of actual ill-temper .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 28]: Looking back he realised that it was the intimacy of that week spent at the Court a month before , which made the present condition so unbearable .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 53]: Then , day after day , Cassandra had sat alone by his side , now working at her embroidery , and again dropping her thread , and sitting with folded hands , while they talked together -- that talk which never jarred , never wearied , never seemed more than just begun .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 24]: He had tried at times to recall what exactly they had talked about during those lengthening hours , but he could not remember .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 43]: The subject had seemed of so little importance , it had been but a vehicle to convey the inward sympathy and understanding , an opportunity of hearing Cassandra 's voice , and watching the lights pass over her beautiful , vivid face .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 17]: It had been a happy face in those days , but it was not happy to-day .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 45]: A look of strain was upon it which corresponded to his own ; there were moments of suspense when he sensed that she also was holding her breath ; moments of exasperated check , when his own anger leapt to meet an answering flame .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 19]: On the morning of the day on which Teresa was to arrive , Peignton made a determined revolt .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 23]: Breakfast was over , and the five members of the party had strolled on to the verandah to enjoy the fresh air .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 29]: When the Squire sounded the usual cry of haste , Dane nerved himself , and spoke out : `` I think I shall stay at home this morning .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 6]: I feel inclined to laze .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 10]: You 'll enjoy a single for a change . ''
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 7]: There was a moment 's silence .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 21]: Dane was conscious that to each of the four hearers his words had come with the effect of a shock .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 16]: Cassandra strolled a yard or two away , and stood with her back towards him .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 10]: Grizel 's golden eyes were fixed on his face .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 5]: `` What 's this ?
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 5]: What 's this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 8]: cried the Squire , breaking the silence .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 15]: `` Ca n't bear to be out of the way , ca n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 13]: I 'll tell Miss Teresa what a devoted lover she 's got !
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 26]: Upon my word , it 's a mercy she 's coming , for the strain has been getting too much for you these last days .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 12]: Quite ratty once or twice , was n't he , Beverley ?
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 13]: It 's all right , old man , it 's all right !
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 3]: We understand .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 10]: Been there ourselves , have n't we , Beverley ?
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 8]: It 's a stage -- a stage .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 17]: Painful at present , but ` twill cease before long , as the little hymn says .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 4]: Eh , what ?
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 4]: Look at Beverley !
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 15]: Only been married six months , and as callous as the best of us .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 14]: Goes off comfortably , day after day , and leaves his wife behind .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 10]: Never gives her a thought till he comes back .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 6]: Do you , Beverley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 8]: `` Not one , '' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 48]: He looked across into Grizel 's eyes , and Grizel looked back at him , and in that glance was concentrated all the poetry , and all the music and all the pure and lovely things that have lived and blossomed , since the beginning of time .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 14]: But the Squire saw none of it , because his eyes were blind .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 8]: `` Do n't be a fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 10]: he continued bluffly , addressing himself to his guest .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 15]: `` The time will pass twice as quickly if you 've something to do .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 19]: We 'll be back for lunch ; that will give you time to walk comfortably to the station .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 24]: As a matter of fact , my dear fellow , you 're bound to come , for we 've fixed up the game .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 16]: We 'll let you off to-morrow , but you ca n't chuck us to-day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 22]: He turned back into the house to collect his clubs , which lay in the gun-room half a dozen yards away .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 15]: Martin and Grizel followed , and for the moment Cassandra and Dane were alone .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 21]: She stood still and rigid , her hands clasping the rail of the verandah , her eyes staring straight ahead .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 13]: Peignton drew nearer ; so near that his arm almost touched hers .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 9]: His heart pounded within him with sickening thuds .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 53]: It seemed to him that if she would give him one glance of understanding and sympathy , he could hold himself in , as he had done a dozen times before , but she stood immovable , vouchsafing no sign , and suddenly he found himself at the end of his endurance .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 27]: He bent his head to hers , and his voice came in a thick , broken whisper : '' _ I wish to God _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 14]: he gasped , '' _ I could break my ankle again _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 13]: The next moment the Squire returned calling loudly for Martin to follow .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 14]: The three men shouldered their clubs , and crunched down the garden path .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 8]: That afternoon at tea-time , Teresa arrived .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 5]: `` THIN-SPUN LIFE . ''
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 14]: During the next two days Grizel was haunted by a prevision of danger .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 24]: She rose with it in the morning , carried it in her heart all day , was pursued by it in her dreams .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 27]: On the surface all seemed smooth and placid , -- a pretty house , a charming garden , a party of friends enjoying the summer weather .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 30]: There were games , there was laughter , there was a flow of words , but beneath it all , her sensitive nature sensed the rumbling of a storm .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 48]: The third morning the sun blazed from a cloudless sky , but within and without the air was still and lifeless , and the members of the house party , gathered round the breakfast table , showed signs of an unrefreshing night in pale and listless faces .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 20]: Conversation flagged , and Grizel sounded a frank note of warning : `` I 'm in a vile temper .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 7]: Be careful , all of you .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 9]: If anyone annoys me , I 'll snap .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 6]: Nothing seems right this morning .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 12]: Martin , the shape of your head gets on my nerves !
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 12]: I ca n't think _ why _ I married you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 7]: `` Neither can I , darling .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 5]: Have some cream ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 25]: Martin carried the jug round the table , and tried to pour cream over a plate of strawberries , but Grizel pushed him aside .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 7]: `` Do n't _ fuss _ !
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 11]: If I want cream , I can ask for it .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 6]: Some people have no tact .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 9]: Why was n't breakfast set in the garden ?
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 23]: Nobody thinks of anything in this house , unless I see after it myself ... Let 's have a picnic lunch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 12]: Martin looked at the Squire , the Squire looked at Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 33]: Their plans were made for a long day 's golf , and each felt a pang of anticipatory regret ; moreover , each hated picnics , with a true man 's hatred .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 17]: Grizel 's quick eyes caught the glance , and had no difficulty in understanding its meaning .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 13]: It seemed indeed that she was thankful of an opportunity to snap .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 8]: `` Pray , do n't trouble yourselves .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 10]: We do n't want anyone to come on sufferance .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 16]: Captain Peignton will look after Teresa , and Cassandra and I are perfectly happy alone .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 8]: Go off on your horrid old golf .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 7]: We do n't want you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 9]: `` I apologise for my wife , Raynor .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 9]: She is usually quite polite to her visitors .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 6]: Just a little atmospheric disturbance .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 4]: Take no notice .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 9]: She 'll be sorry by and by . ''
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 25]: Grizel looked across the table , and made two separate and deliberate grimaces , one at the Squire , the other at her husband .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 14]: `` That 's nothing to what I can do , if I choose !
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 4]: Better be careful !
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 11]: Captain Peignton , do _ you _ want to come ?
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 33]: You 're engaged , of course , and engaged men used to wish to be with their _ fiancees _ , but that 's all changed since they began to play golf .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 39]: I 'm a bride of six months , and my husband vowed before hundreds of witnesses to cherish me all his life , and you see how he scowls if I ask him to spare me an hour !
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 17]: Teresa , be warned by me , and break it off unless he gives up golf .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 6]: I hate and detest golf .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 6]: Golf has ruined my life .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 13]: We 'll look after you , Teresa dear , do n't worry !
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 22]: We 'll have chicken and mayonnaise , and fruit and lemonade , and Cassandra and I will dry your tears . ''
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 12]: `` But I 'm coming ; I want to come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 4]: Peignton assured her .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 33]: `` It 's too hot for golf , and a picnic would be good fun if we can find a spot where there 's some air , and not too much undergrowth .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 14]: I like to eat at a picnic , not to be eaten myself .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 15]: I was up half a dozen times last night anointing myself with ammonia . ''
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 6]: `` I know a place .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 7]: I spotted it a week ago .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 22]: Just beyond Queensdom , the cliff shelves steeply and leaves a patch of shade open to all the air there is .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 76]: It 's quite a short walk , -- a mile or a mile and a half ; the servants can leave the baskets , and come back for their own lunch , and in the afternoon we 'll sleep , Cassandra and I , and discuss the iniquities of husbands , while you two go off on your lone , and come back to us for tea ... What it is to be engaged ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 16]: Teresa smiled happily , Martin raised his eyes to the ceiling in tragic self-vindication . ''
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 13]: _ Who _ is always holding forth on the necessity of exercise ?
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 15]: _ Who _ is always warning me against the danger of a sedentary life ?
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 12]: _ Who _ insisted upon a house near to golf links ?
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 20]: _ Who _ goads me every night of her life to arrange a match for the next day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 8]: `` I do , '' cried Grizel .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 5]: It 's my duty .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 9]: And then I 'm furious when you go .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 4]: Of course again .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 4]: Any wife is .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 11]: Do you expect me to be _ pleased _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 8]: `` It would seem a natural inference .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 10]: -- If you really mean what you say . ''
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 8]: `` I _ do _ mean it .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 62]: I want you to have everything you like ; I 'm a monster of unselfishness over night , but to sit still in the morning , watching you dressing yourself up , polishing your clubs , starting off grinning from ear to ear , so happy to go off without me , and to feel pleased at the time -- no !
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 6]: that 's beyond me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 4]: Grizel declared vigorously .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 9]: `` I 'm human , my good man .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 11]: Do n't expect me to act like an angel . ''
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 16]: Bernard Raynor glanced across at his wife and laughed ; his slow , complaisant laugh .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 10]: `` You must be a full-blown angel , Cass .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 2]: What ?
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 8]: Never gives _ you _ any qualms !
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 16]: Wait a bit , Mrs Beverley , and you 'll find it comes easy enough .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 13]: In another year you 'll be thankful to be rid of him .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 9]: Deadly mistake to hang together all the time !
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 22]: Go your own way , and allow the other to do the same ; that 's the sure tip for matrimony .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 11]: Then you jog on contentedly , and avoid spars . ''
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 24]: The blue , shallow eyes roved round the table , complacently seeking approval ; complacently unconscious of the artificiality of the smiles vouchsafed .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 10]: Cassandra held her head high , disdaining a reply .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 16]: Grizel hugged a glorious certainty that there would be no `` jogging '' for her .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 32]: Storms perchance , half-serious , half-pretence , clearing the atmosphere , and opening the way for a glorious `` make up '' ; but a `` jog , '' -- never !
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 2]: never !
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 20]: Teresa mentally condemned both , and reflected how much more wisely she herself would manage _ her _ husband .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 21]: From the beginning there should be a fair arrangement -- so much time for sport , so much for home .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 12]: One would not want a man pottering round all the time .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 13]: Grizel 's good-humour returned with characteristic speed , nevertheless conversation still flagged .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 17]: An atmosphere of strain lay over the little company , and silenced the usual merry banter .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 14]: Dane and Cassandra had not looked at each other since the first greeting .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 23]: They had agreed to the proposal of the picnic out of polite necessity , but to each the prospect was drearily unwelcome .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 26]: A _ partie carree _ afforded no opportunities for the talks _ a deux _ , which were the only things for which they cared .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 23]: Cassandra saw herself sitting on the cliff-side watching the two figures walk away side by side until they disappeared round the headland .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 19]: What would they do when they were alone together , with no onlookers but the seagulls swirling overhead ?
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 23]: Would he take her in his arms , would his calmness disappear , and his eyes grow dark with love and longing ?
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 30]: Would they sit entwined together , beatifically content , asking from the wealth of the universe nothing more than this , -- to be together , to be alone ?
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 22]: Never in her life had Cassandra experienced that sensation , yet she could imagine it with mysterious , with horrible distinctness .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 17]: She could project herself into Teresa 's place , and feel the tingling current of joy .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 41]: And she must sit afar off in the shade , and pretend to sleep ... At ten o'clock the two men started off for the golf links , but it was not until noon that the picnic party followed suit .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 39]: As there was no new ground to explore , and as the eating of lunch seemed to be the _ raison d'etre _ of the excursion , it was plainly foolish to start until the luncheon hour approached .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 44]: The servants had gone on in advance to unpack the hampers , and after the walk cross the bare , unshaded fields , it was a refreshment to sit down in the cool patch of shade , and taste the refreshing sea breeze .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 24]: Immediately in front the cliff curved sharply inland , so that the lap of blue waters surrounded two sides of the little platform .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 47]: Marking the farther side of the narrow bay , a white headland jutted into the sea , and the sharp glare of the sun intensified each colour in its turn , blue sea , bluer sky , white cliff , crowned by a tangle of green .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 30]: Inland , to the rear of the headland , lay fields of oats and barley , interspersed with patches of yellow groundsel , and the blaze of myriad poppies .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 10]: Cassandra 's colour-loving eyes dwelt lingeringly upon the scene .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 21]: There was not a human creature in sight ; a few white-sailed yachts alone broke the surface of the waters .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 15]: The soft lap of the waves added to the impression of rest and peace .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 20]: She lay drinking in the beauty of it , while the final preparations for the meal were being made .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 40]: In her mind was no prevision that in future years that scene was to be associated in her mind with an extremity of pain and fear , with the dawning of a joy that hurt more sharply than pain .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 42]: She was conscious only of rest to her tired limbs , of satisfaction to her craving for beauty , acutely conscious of Dane Peignton 's presence , as he stood talking to Teresa , helping her to arrange the cushioned seats .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 13]: For the rest , she was weary and discouraged , and oh !
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 3]: overpoweringly lonely !
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 22]: But nowadays she always felt lonely ... The servants pronounced all ready , and retraced their way across the field path .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 12]: Grizel made a tour of inspection and gave a favourable verdict .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 6]: `` It looks -- scrum !
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 28]: Why are stray meals always so much more attractive than proper ones , and why are men so stupid that they ca n't understand that they are ?
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 11]: That 's one of the many distinctions between the sexes .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 5]: All women adore picnics .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 6]: All men -- do n't !
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 33]: `` Perhaps , '' Dane volunteered , seating himself in front of the cloth , in response to a gesture of invitation , `` perhaps because -- they have longer legs . ''
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 10]: `` Well , you must tuck them up somehow .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 12]: They ca n't take up the _ whole _ side ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 20]: Grizel objected , sinking down in a compact little mass in which her own legs apparently ceased to exist .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 5]: `` Let me see .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 5]: Where do we begin ?
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 6]: Savoury eggs , chicken mayonnaise .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 29]: We 'll start on the eggs as a _ hors d'oeuvre _ , and dull the first fierceness of our appetites before getting on to the real business .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 7]: -- I hope everyone is hungry .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 15]: Let 's be polite , and eat very slowly to make it last out .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 25]: It 's such a blank feeling at a picnic when the feed 's over , -- like a wedding when the bride has gone .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 12]: When we 've done , the gulls shall have their turn .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 8]: _ Do _ gulls eat mayonnaise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 12]: Cassandra was conscious of a certain effort in the light babble .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 31]: She suspected that Grizel was forcing herself to talk , to ease the strain , which like a low rumble of thunder had underlain the peace of the last week .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 28]: In the midst of her own pain , she felt a pang of regret for her hostess , -- a pang of compunction for her own shortcomings .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 10]: If only Bernard would be induced to return home !
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 21]: but as long as fine weather and good play were his portion , no persuasion would be of any avail .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 17]: There was nothing for it but to set her teeth and endure , and -- incidentally !
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 13]: -- to make things as little trying as possible for other people .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 13]: She sent a smile across the table to cheer Grizel 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 9]: `` I 'm too lazy to be hungry .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 23]: It seems a waste of time to eat , instead of peacefully feeding one 's mind on the beauty of it all .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 9]: All the same these eggs are mighty good .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 19]: I wonder how often before tea we shall refer to a painted sail upon a painted ocean . ''
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 10]: `` Yes , but _ try _ not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 4]: Grizel pleaded earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 30]: She was relieved to see Peignton help himself to a second egg , and consume it with relish ; relieved to see Teresa carefully sifting sugar into her lemonade .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 14]: Such simple , homely acts seemed to keep at bay the creeping dread .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 21]: It was so easy for Grizel to be happy , to banish fear , and plant hope in its place .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 33]: She was as quick to pounce upon signs of good , as most people are upon menaces of evil , and Cassandra 's smile was sufficient to send her spirits racing upwards .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 54]: She ate and she talked ; few people can do the two things at one time with out neglecting one or the other , but Grizel came triumphantly through the ordeal , keeping her listeners in a gentle ripple of laughter , and demanding nothing of them but an occasional word of response .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 18]: Then in the middle of a complicated sentence she stopped , and looked sharply at her friend .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 17]: Cassandra rose with a hasty movement , struggled to speak , and pointed to her throat .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 4]: `` A. . .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 6]: bone ... Do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 24]: The `` Do n't '' was accompanied by a gesture of the arm , as though to thrust away any offer of help .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 26]: She walked away a few yards ' distance and stood facing the sea , while her companions looked at one another , sympathetic but calm .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 4]: `` A bone !
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 4]: In the salad .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 5]: The _ Wretch _ !
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 7]: I 'll give her notice to-night .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 6]: _ Poor _ dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 8]: `` It 's horrid swallowing a bone .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 5]: I did it once .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 4]: It was rabbit .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 6]: Mother was quite frightened . ''
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 4]: Peignton said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 21]: His eyes were fixed on the white figure outlined against the blue , on the shoulders which rose and fell .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 14]: He filled a tumbler with water and sat waiting , glass in hand .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 23]: A moment passed , the upheave of the shoulders became more pronounced , he rose swiftly and walked to Cassandra 's side .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 24]: She stepped away from him as he approached , waving him away , but he had seen her face and kept steadily on .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 4]: `` Drink this .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 3]: Gulp it !
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 7]: It will carry it down . ''
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 33]: The waving fingers spilled half of the liquid , he steadied it with his own hand , while she gulped , and panted , and gulped again , and struggled choking away .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 18]: The drink had not dislodged the bone , it had served only to hinder the sharpened breath .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 13]: Peignton hurried back to the table and seized a lump of bread .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 9]: Grizel and Teresa stared wide-eyed , and silent .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 61]: Even in the moment which it had taken to go and to come , Cassandra 's face had taken a deeper hue ; the damp stood on her forehead , but she made a gallant effort at composure , standing with her back resolutely turned to her companions , so that they might be spared the sight of her struggles .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 8]: `` I 've brought you some bread .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 8]: That moves it often when water fails .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 11]: Chew it for a moment , then gulp it whole .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 8]: As big a piece as you can .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 11]: It 's a wretched feeling , but it will pass .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 5]: A big bite now !
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 6]: ... Swallow it whole . ''
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 32]: She snatched it from him , crammed it in her mouth , struggled with a force that was frightening to see , choked and retched , and staggered against his arm .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 6]: The bone had not moved .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 8]: From behind came a murmur of consternation .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 11]: Grizel and Teresa swept forward , calling out confused instructions .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 5]: `` More water ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 8]: `` Kneel down ; bend your head !
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 5]: ... Massage your throat .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 3]: Press downwards !
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 9]: More bread ; gulp _ hard _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 13]: Cassandra faced them suddenly , her lips curved back from her teeth .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 37]: She struggled to speak , but the hoarse sounds had no coherence , her eyes rolled from one face to the other , and on each as she looked there fell the dawning of mortal fear .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 26]: They had read the terror in Cassandra 's eyes , the next moment they saw it afresh in the sudden violent breakdown of her composure .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 17]: She no longer avoided them , but came nearer , stretching out her hands in appeal .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 13]: Her face was red and mottled , and strangely , horribly changed .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 27]: Grizel was white as paper , but she kept her composure better than the girl by her side , and spoke in calm , level tones .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 12]: `` Cassandra , try , _ try _ to be quiet !
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 8]: You make things worse by rushing about .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 7]: We _ will _ help you .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 6]: It will be all right .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 13]: Try pushing something down ... Here 's the handle of my fan .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 3]: Try that .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 2]: Hard !
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 5]: Push it well down .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 11]: Oh , do n't , do n't give up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 20]: For after one desperate trial Cassandra had sent the fan spinning into space over the edge of the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 28]: For a moment in her desperation she looked inclined to follow herself , and Dane quickly moved his position so as to stand between her and danger .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 15]: How many moments had elapsed since they had been happily seated on the grass ?
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 18]: So few , -- so pitifully few , yet enough to wreck the exquisite machine of life !
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 37]: Not alone to Cassandra herself , but also to the anguished onlookers , came now the realisation that this accident was no trifling happening of a moment , but a grim battle between life and death .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 31]: The bone was a long one , lodged in such a manner that to attempt to move it by the usual means was but to accelerate the process of suffocation .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 68]: Cassandra was being suffocated ; moment by moment the inhalations of breath became more difficult , her strength was weakening beneath the strain , but still she struggled and fought , and raised wild arms to the sky , while moment by moment , youth , beauty , and charm fell away from the blackening face , leaving behind nothing but a mask of torture and despair .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 14]: Both the women were weeping , but they were unconscious of their tears .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 14]: At that moment existence meant nothing more than an anguished realisation of helplessness .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 25]: Theirs was the most lacerating trial of life , -- the torture of looking on helplessly , and watching a fellow-creature done to death .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 6]: Then suddenly the scene changed .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 28]: Cassandra 's limbs gave way , and she fell to the ground , and as she fell Peignton fell after her , and knelt by her side .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 35]: To the onlookers the man 's face was as unrecognisable as that of the woman ; in both was the same terror , the same despair , almost it appeared , the same suffering .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 25]: It was a voice which they had never heard before , which spoke now , uttering wild appealing words : `` Cassandra -- Darling !
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 12]: Oh , my precious , what can I do for you ?
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 8]: ... God show me what to do !
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 22]: Oh , my God , to standby and see this ... I 'd give my soul ... It ca n't be .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 5]: -- It ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 5]: It 's not possible !
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 9]: ... Cassandra , _ try _ , try !
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 23]: For my sake , for my sake , darling ... How am I to live ... '' The wild words surged on .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 4]: Did anyone hear ?
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 4]: or hearing understand ?
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 20]: Even to Teresa herself they seemed for the moment to voice nothing but the cry of her own heart .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 26]: The shadow of death had obliterated the things of life ; nothing counted , nothing mattered , but Cassandra , and her struggle for breath .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 40]: With every moment her strength was ebbing , the faint whistling sounds emerged less frequently from her writhing lips , the black tint deepened on her cheeks , even as she gazed , the staring eyes rolled and fixed .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 4]: Then Peignton pounced .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 32]: Like a wild beast leaping on its prey , he pounced upon the prostrate form , and lifting it in his arms he shook and tore , he dragged and bent .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 10]: The two women shrieked , and hid their faces .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 43]: Of all the terrors that had been , the most ghastly and blood-curdling of all was the sight of this maniac figure with its superhuman strength , and the jointless , lifeless form , tossed to and fro ; beaten , abused .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 17]: The onlookers thought , -- if thought were possible , -- that Dane had gone mad .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 26]: It seemed the crowning horror that in death Cassandra 's body should be so outraged ; but they had no strength to move or protest .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 13]: Suddenly came a cry ; a cry of triumph , not grief .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 25]: Peignton had sunk to the ground , but Cassandra lay in his arms , and the breath was once more whistling through her lips .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 6]: `` It has moved ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 5]: `` It has moved !
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 3]: She breathes .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 10]: For God 's sake , _ Water _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 32]: In a second it was in his hand , and Teresa knelt , holding the jug , while he sprinkled drops on the dark brow , and moistened the cracking lips .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 22]: The face resting against his shoulder was still unrecognisable , still terrible to see , but momentarily life was flowing back .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 26]: The brutal wildness of Dane 's assault had done its work in removing the block , and air was rushing back into the flattened lungs .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 31]: The marvellous intricacy of the machine of life was at work once more ... Peignton bathed , and the two women knelt by his side , watching with fascinated eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 22]: Gradually as the dark hue faded , other marks came into view , the marks of bruises left by frenzied fingers .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 34]: There were marks on Cassandra 's brow , on her cheek , on the slim column of her throat , on her hands , on the arms beneath the torn fragments of sleeves .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 5]: Everywhere there were bruises .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 36]: The women held their breath at the sight , Peignton groaned and shuddered as with a nausea of horror , but he went on bathing , his hand resolutely steadied to hoard the precious drops .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 55]: Only once , with an uncontrollable impulse , he bent and pressed his lips against the most cruel of the marks , holding her close the while , crooning over her in a passion of tenderness , and as he lifted his head Cassandra 's eyes opened , and looked upward into his face .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 26]: They were conscious eyes , and the opening of them brought back the first resemblance to that Cassandra who had so horribly lost her identity .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 22]: Deeply , darkly blue they stared out of the disfigured face , met Dane 's adoring gaze , and gazed back .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 39]: For a moment it seemed as though the wraith of a smile were dawning in their depths , then pain claimed her once more , and she groaned and winced , lifting a hand to her bruised throat .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 17]: It was a piteous little action , and Dane 's self-possession broke down at the sight .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 9]: Once more he bent his head to hers .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 8]: Once more the caressing words burst forth .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 6]: `` Darling , forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 8]: I _ had _ to do it !
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 33]: ... '' Then for the first time Grizel felt a tremor pass through the figure of the girl by her side , and looked with a pang into a set white face .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 47]: Through her quick mind flashed the realisation that here was another threatened death , -- the death of Teresa 's youth ... She laid a hand on the girl 's shoulder , and spoke in brisk , commonplace tones : `` She must be laid down .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 8]: Collect the cushions and make a bed .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 10]: She will come round more quickly lying flat . ''
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 11]: Teresa rose and with automatic obedience set about her work .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 18]: Grizel took advantage of her absence to seize Dane 's arm between a vigorous finger and thumb .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 10]: Her eyes met his with a gleam of anger .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 5]: `` Pull yourself together !
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 6]: Think what you are saying .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 9]: Have you forgotten that Teresa is here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 4]: Apparently he had .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 21]: Even now when he was reminded , his blank look showed that his mind was incapable of realising her existence .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 6]: Grizel wasted no more words .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 15]: Nor indeed was there time , for Teresa came back carrying the piled cushions .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 32]: Their gay colour accentuated the pallor of her own face , but she was composed as ever , and arranged an impromptu bed on the grass with firm , capable hands .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 5]: `` That 's right .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 10]: Perfectly flat ; her head must not be raised .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 5]: Now , Captain Peignton !
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 5]: this way a please !
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 5]: Pacing the sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 26]: Peignton 's answer was to entwine his arms more firmly ; it seemed to the watching eyes as if Cassandra herself nestled closer in response .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 11]: Grizel bent downwards , and forcibly unloosed the clasped hands .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 14]: `` I am accustomed to nursing ... you must obey me , please .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 11]: You are doing her harm , keeping off the air .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 5]: Lay her down here .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 4]: At once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 15]: Grizel had different ways of enforcing her will , but they were invariably successful .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 10]: The stem tone of command roused Peignton into obedience .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 23]: With painful effort he rose , laid his burden on the cushions , and stood over her , straightening his cramped arms .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 34]: The mad output of strength which had saved Cassandra 's life had left him almost as much exhausted as herself , but so far he had had no time to think of himself .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 12]: Now that his work was over , the realisation would come .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 15]: Grizel poured out a glass of wine , and forced it into his hands .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 7]: `` Drink it -- this moment !
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 16]: You ca n't afford to break down , there 's too much to be done .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 7]: We will stay with her here .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 8]: You must go home for help ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 14]: `` Do n't dispute , please ... You will do as I say .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 13]: Nature will help her now ; we can only leave her alone .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 23]: You must go home and telephone , -- to the Club House for her husband , to the village for the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 6]: They must come straight here .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 16]: And the car , -- it must drive to the nearest point , and wait .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 11]: Possibly in an hour she may be able to walk .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 9]: If not , she can be carried . ''
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 7]: `` I 'll carry her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 11]: `` Her husband will carry her , or the men .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 17]: Tell two men to come , and bring brandy , smelling-salts , anything you think of .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 10]: If you are wise you will lie down yourself .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 12]: You are worn out , and can do no good here .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 7]: We do n't want two invalids .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 5]: Now , please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 15]: For a moment Peignton stood gazing down at the motionless figure on the grass .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 14]: Then hunching his shoulders , turned inland , and took the field path .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 10]: Teresa straightened herself to watch him as he went .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 16]: She was kneeling by Cassandra 's side , but he had no glance for her .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 16]: She watched him pass swiftly down the narrow path between the barley and the oats .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 17]: The poppies blazed their brightest red ; the patches of groundsel shone golden in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 17]: Cassandra lay motionless , with closed eyes , her breathing growing momentarily more natural and regular .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 25]: Grizel smoothed the hair from her brow , laid a practised finger on her pulse , and crept away , beckoning Teresa to follow .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 4]: `` All right !
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 3]: doing well .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 4]: Leave her alone .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 7]: The air is her best medicine .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 5]: Perhaps she will sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 4]: Teresa , dear !
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 6]: get me some wine . ''
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 17]: She collapsed in a limp little heap on the grass , and raised a piteous face .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 31]: To evoke Teresa 's pity for herself , not to pity Teresa , that was her inspiration , and to this intent she made the most of the natural exhaustion .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 18]: Teresa waited upon her deftly , and then quite calmly and sensibly proceeded to wait upon herself .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 43]: Grizel 's eyes widened with amaze as she beheld the girl with a wine-glass in one hand , and a sandwich , in the other , eating and drinking with as much apparent composure as if the tragic interruption had never occurred .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 14]: To the ardent , impulsive nature such composure seemed unnatural , almost brutal .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 8]: `` How _ can _ she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 5]: Grizel asked herself blankly .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 5]: `` How can she ?
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 21]: Oh , Martin , dear , to know your love gone , and to sit down quietly to eat sandwiches !
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 2]: Chewing .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 3]: -- Chewing !
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 11]: What can it feel like to be made like that ?
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 17]: It 's marvellous , it 's magnificent , _ mais ce n'est pas la femme _ !
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 24]: Poor , poor little Teresa , and my poor , beautiful Cassandra , and poor Dane Peignton , poor Squire , poor Everybody !
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 12]: God help us all ... We 're in a rare muddle !
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 7]: What is to happen next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 16]: Her breath caught in an involuntary sob , and Teresa put out a protecting arm .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 33]: Grizel leant against it , careful still to demand , rather than offer consolation , and they sat shoulder to shoulder , hand clasped in hand , while the minutes dragged past .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 18]: From time to time Grizel rose and tiptoed across the grass to look at Cassandra 's face .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 35]: Once she breathed her name , and the blue eyes opened in a recognising glance , but instantly they closed again , and the whole pose of the figure proclaimed an extremity of fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 11]: `` But it will pass ; it will pass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 8]: Grizel whispered to Teresa on her return .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 7]: `` It was a maddening experience .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 8]: We were all mad , I think .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 8]: It was enough to make us mad .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 15]: Millions of people go through life , and never even imagine such a horror .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 20]: But it was so short ... only a few minutes ... it will pass ... it will pass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 6]: `` Oh , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 10]: said Teresa steadily , `` it will pass . ''
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 10]: The healthy colour had come back to her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 23]: Beyond a certain hardness in the set of the lips , the smooth young face showed no sign of the recent conflict .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 12]: A quarter of an hour dragged by ; half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 36]: Cassandra 's breath came in deep , steady respirations , her hands lay slack by her side , she slept the sleep of exhaustion , and the two women sat silently watching her from afar .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 35]: Three-quarters of an hour , an hour , and then at last , over the shimmer of barley came the sight of hurrying figures , -- the Squire and Martin running to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 18]: Grizel rose , crossed to Cassandra 's side , and laid a gentle hand on her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 10]: She must be prepared for the men 's appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 7]: There must be no more shocks .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 6]: `` Wake up , dear .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 4]: It 's time .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 13]: The men will be here in a minute to take us home .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 3]: Sit up !
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 8]: You are such a dishevelled old dear .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 7]: Let me tidy you up . ''
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 37]: Cassandra had started painfully at the first touch , but she sat up now , supporting herself on her hands , while Grizel smoothed the straying hair , and gave deft touches to the disordered attire .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 27]: On the colourless face the bruises stood out with increasing distinctness , the lips were swollen , the eyes seemed to have retreated into the head .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 20]: Grizel seized a light scarf , tied it hoodwise under the chin , and pulled forward the screening folds .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 25]: She had a woman 's tender commiseration for the loss of beauty , a woman 's natural instinct to conceal it from masculine eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 22]: Thus the Squire , hurrying forward , beheld his wife sitting erect , orderly in attire , with face discreetly shaded .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 12]: `` Good God , Cass , you gave me a fright !
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 13]: I 've run all the way ... Swallowed a bone , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 3]: Beastly carelessness .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 6]: Peeling all right now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 12]: For a moment Grizel felt inclined to repent that shrouding veil !
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 13]: `` She 's _ not _ at all right , Mr Raynor .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 23]: It was a terrible time ... We must get her home as quickly as possible , and put her to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 6]: `` Poor old Cass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 5]: said the Squire kindly .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 9]: `` Feel a bit played out , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 12]: It 's all over , you know ; all over now .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 8]: We 'll soon have you all right .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 12]: Think you could walk , if I gave you an arm ?
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 13]: The car is waiting , at the end of the field . ''
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 21]: Cassandra rose with unexpected strength , and the Squire tucked her arm in his , with a pat of reassurement .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 7]: `` That 's a good girl .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 12]: Told you you were n't half as bad as you thought !
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 11]: You 'll feel A1 after an hour 's rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 31]: The two figures passed on in advance , Cassandra 's head bowed low over her breast , and the three who were left , stared after them in dumb amaze .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 23]: Martin had passed his arm round Grizel 's shoulder , and she clung to him , trembling with mingled misery and indignation .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 3]: `` Martin !
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 2]: Martin !
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 14]: she nearly died ... she was fighting for her life before our eyes !
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 10]: It was horrible , -- the most ghastly horror .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 11]: We felt as if we should go mad , too .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 29]: She has been down to the very gates of death , and he smiles , he jokes , -- he is as calm as if nothing had happened !
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 8]: Has he _ no _ heart ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 6]: `` No imagination , dearest .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 5]: That 's the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 11]: Nothing is real to him that he has n't seen .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 4]: You poor girls !
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 6]: you look worn out yourselves .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 23]: there will be room for you in the car , and you will want to look after her when she gets home .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 16]: I 'll come back , and wait till the men arrive for the hampers . ''
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 14]: He held out his free hand and slid it through Teresa 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 8]: `` Your man is chasing the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 8]: You 'll find him waiting at home .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 10]: What a comfort that he was with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 10]: `` He saved her life , '' Teresa said .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 14]: `` Not one man in a thousand would have done as he did .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 6]: He was so brave . ''
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 7]: `` I know someone braver ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 6]: said Grizel in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 4]: JUDGMENT OF YOUTH .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 48]: For the rest of the afternoon the house was still as the grave , each member of the little party preserving a rigorous silence for the sake of those others who were presumably asleep , but with the exception of Cassandra sleep was conspicuous by its absence .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 24]: The Squire retired to a distant corner of the garden , and practised putting by himself , reflecting ruefully on his interrupted game .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 16]: Martin sat by Grizel 's couch , mentally abusing himself for the morning 's desertion .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 21]: Grizel had asked him to join the picnic , and he had preferred to go off on his own devices .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 28]: Probably if he had been present , the accident would have happened just the same , but he would have been beside her to help and support .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 19]: Excuse himself as he might , the fact remained that Grizel had gone through an appalling experience alone .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 38]: The thought filled him with a passion of tenderness and remorse , and even in the depths of her mental and physical exhaustion , Grizel luxuriated in the consciousness , and lured him on with tender wiles .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 26]: It was all the rest she wanted , just to lie still , holding Martin 's hand , to feel his touch on her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 21]: The unconsciousness of sleep would have been poor in comparison , for her heart needed healing more than her body .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 39]: A few hours , a few days at most , and even Cassandra herself would have surmounted the physical strain of the morning , but what of the hidden danger from which the veil had been torn aside ?
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 17]: Now that it had been revealed -- what was to happen to those three young lives ?
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 25]: Grizel had given her husband a detailed account of the accident , but she had refrained from telling him of Dane 's mad words .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 15]: Whether or not she would ever tell him , would depend on future events .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 37]: He had a right to know everything that concerned herself , but she would have felt it to be a disloyalty to her friends to have betrayed the new complication which had come into their lives .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 25]: It was for them to work out their own salvation ; for her , as the onlooker , to be silent , and wait .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 34]: As for Martin , he was too much absorbed in his wife to display undue curiosity , and his eyes had discovered nothing mysterious in the condition of either Teresa or Dane himself .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 7]: `` The fellow is played out .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 12]: He must have been half crazed to do what he did .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 11]: No man would have the strength in a normal condition .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 21]: In the great moments of life we draw drafts on our reserve forces , and no effort seems too great .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 7]: But we have to pay up .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 20]: Peignton condensed the energy of months into three or four minutes , and for the moment he is bankrupt .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 21]: It must have been a blood-curdling sight for you , my darling , -- and that poor girl , Teresa !
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 13]: She seemed the calmest of the party , by the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 9]: `` Calmness is comparative -- everything is comparative .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 40]: It 's impossible to know how much people feel ... Oh , Beloved , there are so many sorts , and if they do n't feel _ our _ way , it may be just as bad to them !
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 2]: Martin !
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 33]: we 've been married six months , we know each other six hundred times better than when we began , and there 's this virtue about me -- I do n't pretend !
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 13]: You know the worst of me , as well as the best .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 17]: Honestly -- on your solemnest oath , -- have you _ ever _ been sorry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 5]: Martin did not reply .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 8]: He smiled a smile of ineffable content .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 12]: Grizel tilted her head on the cushion , and smiled back .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 9]: `` I _ knew _ you have n't .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 6]: That 's why I asked .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 16]: If there had been the faintest doubt , I could n't have faced it to-day .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 12]: But there are so many months -- life is so long .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 2]: Martin !
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 5]: you might change ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 5]: Martin 's face sobered .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 31]: His thoughts flew back to the girl wife who , for a few short months , had shared his life ; at whose death life itself had seemed to end .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 21]: He had been but twenty-five at the time , and he had suffered with all the fierce intensity of youth .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 42]: If Juliet had made a similar suggestion in those far-off days , he would have refuted it with scorn , yet he _ had _ changed ; the young image had faded , and a living woman now filled his heart .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 12]: Was it the remembrance of Juliet , which made Grizel doubt ?
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 18]: `` So long as you live , Grizel , it is n't possible that I could change .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 16]: A man who had once loved you could never be satisfied with an ordinary woman .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 11]: And I am a man now , not a boy .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 18]: Even -- even if I were alone again -- '' She leant forward in a quick caress .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 9]: `` You are not going to be alone !
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 10]: I am not going to leave you , Honey !
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 11]: If I were , I should not ask for promises .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 18]: It 's because I intend to live on to eighty or ninety , that I 'm anxious .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 12]: I could n't bear it if you grew cool and cold .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 10]: I would n't _ try _ to bear it !
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 9]: Prosaic matrimony would drive me to the devil .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 24]: I ca n't tell you what sort of devil , -- there might be several , but a devil it would certainly be .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 17]: But if you 'll love me , dear , I 'll grow nearer the angels ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 21]: He laid his head beside hers on the cushion , and they sat silently , through blessed moments of communion .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 18]: In heart and love they were at one , but their thoughts carried them on different voyages .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 26]: When he spoke again , it was to say in tones of kindly toleration : `` Do n't be too hard on the poor Squire .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 17]: He 's a good fellow , and , as you say , there are all sorts .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 6]: Presumably she loved that sort .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 8]: She chose him , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 6]: `` Unfortunately she did n't .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 24]: She chose a waking man , who fell asleep the moment he 'd got her , and has slept on steadily ever since .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 35]: He was in love , you see , and love galvanised him into a show of life , and poor , dear Cassandra saw the miracle , and believed it was going to last .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 56]: You 're a man , my dear , and you 're an author , and you write very clever books , but you do n't realise for a moment how intoxicating it is for a woman to hold the reins in her own hands , while a lord of creation kneels trembling at her feet !
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 21]: It 's the one little time of her life when she is master , and it goes to her head .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 88]: He tells her that she is the sun , and the moon , and the eleven stars , and that his only object in life is to adore her for evermore , and that if she wo n't have him he 'll pine away and die on Wednesday week , and the poor dear thing believes every word , and is so touched to find herself of such importance after being just an ordinary , superfluous girl , that she will promise anything he likes to ask .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 19]: I am talking , of course , '' said Grizel markedly , `` of _ country _ girls !
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 17]: Girls like Cassandra , shut up in moated granges a dozen miles from the nearest anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 6]: _ Not _ of myself !
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 14]: It was _ no _ novelty to me to have men squirming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 7]: `` What a very undignified word !
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 9]: Do n't dare to apply it to me .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 17]: I 'll kneel , as much as you like , but I refuse to squirm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 10]: Martin stretched himself , and rose to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 23]: Grizel was better , beginning to talk in her natural vein , and his conscience began to prick him about his guest .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 14]: `` Do you think you could manage to get a little deep now !
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 11]: I really ought to look after poor old Raynor . ''
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 22]: Grizel accorded a gracious permission , and submitted meekly to an irritating process which Martin called `` making her comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 34]: When the door was closed behind him , she deftly rearranged all the accessories which he had misplaced , and composed herself for the long-deferred rest , but it was not to be .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 26]: In less than five minutes a knock sounded at the door , and after a moment 's pause was repeated in a more insistent fashion .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 5]: `` Come in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 17]: cried Grizel clearly , and Teresa 's head peeped enquiringly round the corner of the door .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 6]: `` You are alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 7]: `` I hoped you would be .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 13]: I could n't rest , and I knew you could n't either .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 14]: Do you mind if I sit down and talk a few minutes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 29]: `` Do , dear ; I 'd like it , '' Grizel said kindly , her eyes fixed on the girl 's figure , with an astonished admiration .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 42]: Teresa had taken off her dress , and put on a plainly made blue cashmere dressing-gown , the loose folds of which disguised the somewhat ungainly lines of her figure , and gave to it an effect of dignity and height .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 26]: Her hair had been unloosed and hung in two heavy plaits to her waist , giving a Gretchen-like expression to the fair , blue-eyed face .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 16]: Teresa had prepared herself for her siesta with characteristic thoroughness , but apparently without avail .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 27]: She seated herself beside Grizel 's couch , folded her hands on her knee , and asked a level question : `` I wanted to know .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 10]: Have you told your husband everything that happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 7]: `` Everything about the accident itself .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 6]: Nothing more , Teresa . ''
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 10]: For a moment the blue eyes lightened with gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 9]: `` I _ thought _ you would n't .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 5]: But most women would .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 9]: I 'd rather no one was told . ''
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 9]: `` No one shall hear anything from me .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 6]: It is not my business .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 8]: I shall forget it , Teresa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 6]: The girl shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 7]: `` You ca n't do that .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 10]: I do n't think I want you to forget .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 10]: It 's a help to have someone who understands .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 13]: Mrs Beverley -- do you think he _ meant _ it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 31]: Grizel sat upright on the sofa , her small hands locked on her knee , and for a long silent minute blue eyes and hazel met in a steady gaze .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 15]: There were no secrets between the two women at the end of that minute .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 10]: `` Yes , Teresa , '' said Grizel unsteadily .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 7]: `` I think he did . ''
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 11]: `` You know he did , '' corrected Teresa gravely .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 38]: She was silent for another moment , sitting motionless with downcast eyes , then deliberately raised them again and continued : `` At the time he did mean it ... She is so beautiful , and fascinating .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 4]: Everyone admires her .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 13]: And it was terrible to watch her choking before one 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 6]: It wrung one 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 11]: What he said at the time should not be counted .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 5]: He was not sane .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 8]: I am thinking of the time before .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 16]: -- Do you , -- do you think he meant it _ before _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 5]: Grizel did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 15]: To her impetuous ardent nature , the girl 's composure seemed terrible and unnatural .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 11]: It affected her more strongly than the most violent hysteria .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 30]: She sat crunched up into the corner of the sofa , looking white and scared , and helpless , flinching before the steady scrutiny of the blue eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 7]: _ Please tell me _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 7]: `` Teresa , I -- wondered !
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 4]: It troubled me .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 5]: Lately I felt sure .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 12]: I was sorry it had been arranged to come here together .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 19]: I tried to alter it ; you know I tried ... Did _ you _ never suspect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 3]: Teresa hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 16]: The colour had faded from her cheek , but she was still calm and collected .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 7]: `` Not -- _ that _ !
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 11]: I knew he admired her -- that was of course .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 12]: I knew he liked to be with her whenever he could .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 8]: Once or twice I felt -- lonely !
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 5]: But she was married .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 7]: -- I never dreamt of this .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 22]: I have read of men falling in love with married women , but I have never known it in real life .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 10]: I did not think he was that sort . ''
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 12]: Scorn spoke in her voice , a youthful intolerance and contempt .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 13]: It was not only on her own account that she was suffering .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 15]: Peignton had been to her the ideal man , and the ideal had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 11]: The whole structure of life seemed shaken under her feet .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 10]: Grizel looked at her , with a saddened glance .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 8]: `` Poor , dear , little girl !
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 13]: It 's hard for you , but you must try to understand .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 26]: You 've lived in a very sheltered little corner , dear , where the difficult things of life have been hidden away out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 23]: It 's hard for you to be quite fair , and see the other point of view as well as your own .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 5]: But you must try .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 7]: You must n't condemn poor Dane .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 16]: He was engaged to you , and he has fallen in love with another woman .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 41]: It sounds bad enough on the face of it , but you and I who know him , and have watched him these last months , know that there has been nothing deliberate about it , nothing guilty or underhand .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 15]: He was engaged to you and he was faithful to you -- in intent .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 6]: He wanted to be faithful .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 20]: The other thing was just a great trial wave which overtook him and swept him off his feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 11]: Teresa set her lips , her face hard and cold .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 14]: `` It could not have swept him , if he had been firm !
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 20]: If he had been faithful to me , he could not have noticed any other woman in that way .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 6]: I never noticed another man .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 7]: I do n't understand it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 3]: Grizel sighed .
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 13]: The youthful arrogance of the girl was at once pitiful and menacing .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 28]: To her there existed but the two hard lines , a right and a wrong , the maze of intersecting paths had no existence in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 15]: Her judgment , like that of all young untried things , was relentlessly hard .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 11]: Grizel sat looking at her , pondering what to say .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 12]: `` When you first knew Cassandra you were fascinated by her .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 9]: You felt a longing to see her again .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 11]: Every time you saw her , you admired her more .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 10]: You have told me about it , so often .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 14]: In a feminine way you fell in love with her yourself , Teresa .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 8]: You _ ought _ to understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 8]: `` He was engaged to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 4]: echoed Teresa obstinately .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 17]: Suddenly her face quivered with pathos `` And -- I 'm young -- I 'm pretty .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 5]: -- I loved him .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 4]: _ Why _ ?
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 8]: `` Oh , my poor child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 12]: Grizel cried sharply , and the tears started to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 34]: Poor , ignorant , complaisant Teresa fighting against the mysteries of life , demanding explanation of the inexplicable , -- what tenderness , what forgiveness was to be expected from such an attitude ?
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 9]: `` He chose me , '' she insisted .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 7]: `` It was his own doing .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 4]: Nobody made him .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 6]: It was his own choice .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 12]: And he had met her _ before _ he asked me .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 8]: We used to talk about her together .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 27]: -- I was glad when he was enthusiastic ... She was my friend , and a married woman with a husband and -- that big boy !
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 6]: He is ten years old .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 9]: She must be thirty at the least . ''
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 13]: All the arrogance of the early twenties rang in Teresa 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 9]: `` It 's such folly -- such madness !
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 14]: It is n't as if she could ever -- love him back . ''
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 2]: Silence .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 21]: Teresa looked up sharply , held Grizel 's eyes in a hard , enquiring stare and deliberately repeated the pronouncement .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 13]: `` It is n't possible that she could care for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 11]: `` Did you find it so difficult , Teresa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 9]: `` Why do you compare her with me ?
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 4]: It 's different .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 7]: You know it 's different . ''
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 7]: `` Yes , I do know .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 12]: You were a free , happy girl with your life ahead .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 26]: _ Her _ youth , the best part of her youth has gone , and she has never had the joy that every woman needs .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 6]: You know what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 7]: We need not go into it .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 14]: Some men mean well , but they have no right to be husbands !
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 15]: The women who have to live with them are slowly starved to death . ''
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 7]: `` She has her boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 8]: `` Yes , she has her boy .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 9]: For a few weeks in the year . ''
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 11]: `` He is her son all the year round . ''
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 9]: `` That 's perfectly true , Teresa . ''
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 17]: `` A married woman with a son ought _ not _ to love another man . ''
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 8]: `` That 's perfectly true , Teresa .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 12]: Do you never by any chance do anything you should not ?
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 23]: Ca n't you find the least scrap of pity in your heart for other people who are more unhappy than yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 11]: `` I am not sorry for people who do wrong .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 9]: It 's easy to talk , Mrs Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 26]: Suppose it was your own husband , and you had seen him , as I did to-day , with another woman -- with Cassandra herself .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 8]: How would _ you _ feel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 9]: Grizel 's grimace was more expressive than words .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 10]: `` My dear , I ca n't imagine it .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 5]: I 'd rather not .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 7]: I should certainly not be calm .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 65]: I 'm an impetuous person who is bound to let off steam , and there would be a considerable amount of steam on that occasion , but I 'm older than you , and have seen more of the world , so that perhaps it would come easier -- after the first explosion -- to be sorry for them as well as myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 8]: `` Why should one be sorry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 29]: `` Because they _ are _ in the wrong , and are bringing sorrow on others , whereas you are the injured martyr , who is sinned against .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 14]: There 's considerable balm in the position -- for those who like it .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 19]: How do you suppose poor Dane will feel at the prospect of his next interview with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 6]: Teresa 's face quivered again .
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 9]: `` He has n't wanted many interviews lately .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 12]: We 've hardly been alone an hour since we came here .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 13]: I suppose I -- should have suspected ... but I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 17]: He has never been demonstrative , but he chose me , he said he loved me .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 7]: I _ trusted _ him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 11]: There was pathos in the lingering on those last words .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 28]: Grizel made a little crooning sound of tenderness , and stretched out a consoling hand , but Teresa ignored it , and rose slowly to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 10]: You 've told me all I wanted to know .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 12]: And I 'm grateful to you for not telling your husband .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 10]: Please do n't mention anything to a single person .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 20]: The less that is said about it the easier it will be to -- '' `` To -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 5]: Grizel 's eyes dilated .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 14]: She sat upright on the sofa , her whole body a-quiver with eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 9]: `` To _ what _ , Teresa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 17]: `` To put things right , '' said Teresa , and marched stolidly from the room .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 4]: BETWEEN TWO WOMEN .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 30]: It was late on the following morning when Teresa , sitting over her embroidery in the garden , saw Dane Peignton making his way towards her across the lawn .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 30]: It was his first appearance since the return from the fateful picnic , and Teresa , looking at him , marvelled at the change which twenty-four hours had wrought .
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 35]: She herself had suffered from shock and disillusionment , yet the mirror had shown no change , the fresh pink colour had not faded from her cheeks , her eyes were clear and blue .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 22]: The first realisation of the truth of Grizel 's words came to her at the sight of Dane 's lined face .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 16]: At the glance of his wan eyes , the forced smile faded from her lips .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 23]: A shiver of dread passed through her at the realisation that there was to be no covering up of the ugly truth .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 18]: The grim determination of Peignton 's mien showed that he was braced for the ordeal of confession .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 11]: They shook hands , and he seated himself beside her .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 31]: A clump of shrubs hid the windows of the house , no path broke the smooth stretch of green ; they were alone , free from the fear of interruption .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 14]: `` I hope you feel better this morning , '' said Teresa primly .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 14]: She was embroidering a large entwined monogram on a square of green velvet .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 23]: The monogram was Peignton 's own , and the square was designed for the back of a blotter for his writing table .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 20]: He had watched its progress from the first stitches onward , and had given his opinion on contrasting shades .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 19]: His face twisted with pain as he watched the sweep of the needle with the long brown thread .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 6]: `` Thank you , yes .
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 4]: I am better .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 8]: -- I was -- very tired ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 23]: Teresa sewed on , her eyes downcast , the needle rhythmically lifting and falling to take up another neat , accurate stitch .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 13]: Her low muslin collar showed the line of the young bending throat .
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 11]: Peignton 's eyes softened into tenderness as he watched her .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 12]: He stretched out his hand , and intercepted another upward sweep .
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 3]: `` Dear !
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 28]: Put that down ... We 've got to have this out ... There is so much that we have to say to each other , Teresa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 16]: Teresa disengaged her hand , folded her work , and turned a resolutely composed face .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 11]: `` Why need we say anything at all ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 5]: _ Why _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 7]: He stared at her in perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 19]: `` You ask me that when you know ... you have seen ... '' `` I must forget .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 5]: We must both forget .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 14]: I must n't judge you for ... for what happened _ then _ .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 15]: I think it will be best if we never speak of it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 24]: Peignton was silent , stricken dumb by amazement , and the paralysing feeling of helplessness which Grizel had experienced at a similar moment .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 18]: The crass certainty of Teresa 's common sense appeared at this moment the most baffling of barriers .
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 15]: He stared at her hopelessly for a long minute , before making his reply .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 5]: `` That is impossible .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 10]: There could be no peace for either of us .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 9]: In justice to myself , I must explain .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 38]: It seems an extraordinary thing to say , but it is the simple truth that until I came down here -- until a couple of days ago , I did not know that I loved Lady Cassandra .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 46]: Only yesterday morning I had decided to make an excuse to go home , to put myself out of temptation ; then , an hour later , I saw her , as it seemed , dying before my eyes , and I forgot everything else .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 15]: It was wrong , of course , confoundedly unkind , -- humiliating for you .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 20]: I apologise with all my soul , Teresa , but ca n't you see how inevitable it was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 21]: `` If you loved her in the first instance , I suppose it was inevitable , '' said Teresa steadily .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 9]: `` But you were engaged to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 9]: She lifted her eyes with a reproachful glance .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 7]: `` You chose _ me _ .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 19]: You said you loved me ... All these weeks we have gone on peacefully , without a hitch .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 6]: I never noticed any change .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 16]: As you insist on talking about it , I should like to understand one thing .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 10]: -- Is it that you grew tired of me ?
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 8]: Was I different from what you expected ?
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 12]: When did you stop -- caring for me at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 9]: `` My dear , I have not stopped !
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 4]: I do care .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 10]: You have been all that is sweet and kind .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 22]: I tell you honestly that I care for you more , not less , than when we were first engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 5]: `` Then -- Why ?
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 8]: I _ do n't _ understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 10]: `` Ah , Teresa , neither did I. . .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 7]: That 's the pity of it .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 8]: It was a mistake from the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 22]: I was lonely , and I wanted a wife , and I liked you better than any of the other girls .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 9]: I was honestly fond of you , dear .
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 9]: I am now , -- but , Teresa !
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 7]: it was affection , not love .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 8]: I had no idea what that meant .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 25]: -- It is only the last few days that I have known ... There is a world of difference between the two things . ''
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 8]: The colour flamed in Teresa 's cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 10]: `` There _ is _ a world of difference .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 4]: One is right .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 6]: The other is -- sin !
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 11]: It is wicked to love your friend 's wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 9]: Dane 's lips twisted in a grim smile .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 33]: `` It is a misfortune , Teresa , a horrible misfortune for us all , but there is nothing that could possibly be called wicked about it , as matters stand to-day .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 8]: Do n't be too hard on me .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 11]: I am about as miserable as a man can be .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 8]: There seems no way out of it .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 36]: I 'd give everything I possess , if I could go back and be as I was when we were first engaged , content and happy , with the prospect of happiness to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 24]: `` I _ did _ make you happy for a time , then , even though it was n't -- the best ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 20]: Teresa 's face relaxed from its hard composure ; a faint twitching showed at the corner of the mouth .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 3]: `` Dane !
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 4]: what was it ?
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 3]: Tell me !
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 4]: I must know .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 9]: What was it made you love her more ?
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 38]: She 's beautiful , but I 'm pretty too , and so much younger , and she wears lovely clothes , but you liked me to be simple ; and she 's clever and amusing -- sometimes !
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 29]: but other times she 's quite dull , and we had always plenty to say , you and I. I took an interest in all you did . ''
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 22]: Dane 's sigh was compounded of pity for Teresa , and for himself at the memory of that `` interest . ''
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 24]: It was true that she had questioned him ceaselessly about his affairs , and had on frequent occasions offered advice concerning their management .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 31]: He had been mildly bored , mildly amused ; looking back on his intercourse with _ his fiancee _ , a contented boredom seemed to have been his normal condition .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 12]: And she compared herself with Cassandra , wanted -- pitiful heavens !
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 6]: to have the difference defined .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 18]: He shook his head in dumb helplessness , but Teresa 's flat voice obstinately repeated the request .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 3]: `` Dane !
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 9]: You must tell me _ why _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 7]: `` Teresa , it 's impossible .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 12]: Good God , do n't you realise how impossible it is ?
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 24]: Why did you care for me instead of other fellows , younger , better looking -- that young Hunter , for example ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 10]: `` Mr Hunter never paid me any attention . ''
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 36]: `` You mean to say , '' he stared at her blankly , `` that if he had , if _ any _ man had -- '' But at that she showed a wholesome anger .
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 7]: `` You know I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 6]: You know I would not .
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 12]: At once , from the very beginning I cared for you .
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 14]: I prayed every night of my life that you would love me back .
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 10]: I used to watch for you wherever I went .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 16]: If I saw you drive past in the dog-cart , I was happy for hours .
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 11]: When you were ill that time I was ill too .
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 23]: They thought it was a chill , but it was n't , it was misery , and not being able to help .
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 12]: One day there was a button hanging loose on your coat .
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 8]: I _ longed _ to mend it !
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 41]: That 's all I wanted , -- just to be able to look after you , and mend your things , and make you comfortable , and sit beside you in the evenings and talk , and watch you smoke .
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 6]: I 'm old-fashioned and domesticated .
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 17]: Lady Cassandra used to laugh at me , and call me Victorian and men laugh too .
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 12]: They say they like old-fashioned girls , but they do n't .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 35]: They may be ` fond ' of them , as you are fond of me , but they get tired , and then -- then ... they meet the Cassandras ... and forget everything !
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 20]: duty , faithfulness -- honour -- '' `` There is no loss of honour in this case , Teresa .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 11]: That is one of the things you must not say .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 19]: This is a bad enough business for us all -- do n't make it worse than it is !
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 10]: There has been no deceit , no double dealing .
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 20]: It was only two days ago that I realised how things were , and then I determined to leave .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 10]: It was that accident which took us unawares . ''
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 14]: Before he realised his slip , Teresa had pounced upon the word . ''
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 4]: _ Us _ !
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 4]: You mean that ?
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 6]: _ She _ cares too ?
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 5]: How do you know ?
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 6]: How do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 26]: `` I did not mean to imply anything of the kind , '' Peignton said sternly , and his eyes sent forth a warning flash .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 42]: Not for the world would he have answered , not for a hundred worlds have confessed to a living creature -- the wondrous , incredible fact that even in her deadly exhaustion Cassandra had understood , and responded to his love .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 24]: Her eyes had met his , her lips had moved , the tiny flutterings of movement had brought her nearer to his heart .
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 22]: He knew that her spirit had responded , and through all the bristling difficulties of the moment the knowledge brought joy .
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 18]: `` We will leave Lady Cassandra 's name out of the discussion , '' he said coldly .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 12]: `` You are not concerned with her , only with me .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 18]: It 's banal to go on repeating that I 'm sorry , you know that well enough .
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 23]: The question now is , -- how can we break off our engagement in the way least unpleasant for _ you _ ?
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 12]: It 's bound to be unpleasant , but -- things pass !
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 27]: In a year or two you 'll meet another fellow , and look back upon this episode , and be glad that it came to nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 41]: I 'm giving you a lot of trouble , but I 've not made a hash of your whole life , as I have of my own ... Think of that , Teresa , and try to forgive me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 40]: `` I shall never care for another man while you are unmarried , and I should be miserable living on at home , as Mary has done , year after year , with nothing happening to break the monotony .
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 14]: So you _ would _ spoil my life as well as your own .
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 8]: And what would you do living alone ?
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 5]: You are not strong .
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 7]: You said you needed a home .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 13]: You 'll have to leave this place and go away among strangers .
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 6]: You 'll be miserable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 7]: `` Very miserable , Teresa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 8]: `` And I shall be miserable too .
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 4]: It 's senseless .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 2]: Dane !
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 29]: will you do something for me -- to show that you really are sorry , and to help us both to , -- to get over this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 7]: `` I will indeed , Teresa .
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 5]: Only try me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 20]: `` Then marry me at once , and let us go away together to live in another place . ''
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 9]: He stared at her , stunned , incredulous .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 16]: Of all the wild , impossible requests this was the last which he had expected .
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 11]: He could hardly believe that he had heard aright . ''
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 5]: _ Marry _ you ?
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 2]: Teresa !
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 6]: You ca n't mean it .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 15]: When you know that I love -- '' She held up a warning hand .
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 10]: `` I thought she was not to be mentioned !
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 7]: I do mean it , Dane .
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 14]: It 's the best thing for you , as well as for me .
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 12]: Ca n't you see that it 's the best thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 8]: `` I see that it 's impossible .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 8]: Excuse me , if I 'm brutal .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 10]: If you could do it , I could n't .
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 5]: I should be wretched .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 7]: I should make you wretched . ''
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 11]: `` You were n't wretched when we were first engaged !
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 13]: You chose me , and you were satisfied , until this happened .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 22]: If we were far away in a new place , you would be satisfied again -- I could make you satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 4]: -- I. . .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 24]: I do n't say -- '' the even voice quavered over the admission -- `` that it would be the _ same _ .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 18]: It can never be the same for either of us , it would be better than nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 12]: We would find a little home , and make it pretty .
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 8]: You would be interested in the land .
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 16]: There 'd be the shooting , and you could keep a horse , and hunt .
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 10]: We 'd grow all our own fruit and vegetables .
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 20]: There would be neighbours ... They would ask us out , and we could give little parties in return .
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 3]: Quite cheaply .
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 18]: There would be quite a lot of things to interest you , and fill up the time .
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 8]: And ... there might be children ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 18]: These last words came with a gasp , rendered additionally touching by the effort which they entailed .
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 20]: Teresa did not approve of such allusions , and did violence to her own feelings in giving them utterance .
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 13]: It was only the desperation of her need which made her daring .
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 20]: Her chin quivered with a childlike helplessness , and Dane looking on felt a pang of tenderness and remorse .
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 6]: `` You poor little girl !
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 5]: You dear little girl !
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 7]: You are too kind to me .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 17]: I do n't deserve it , but I 'll be grateful to you all my life .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 20]: I 'll never forget you , but , I ca n't do it , dear -- I ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 4]: Try to understand .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 14]: Put yourself in my place ... _ I 'm in love _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 12]: `` But it 's no use , '' Teresa repeated stolidly .
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 7]: `` It 's no use . ''
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 34]: She was fighting doggedly with her back to the wall , fighting for love , and for something only less precious than love , the preservation of her own position among her neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 13]: In the estimation of the village Teresa Mallison was a social success .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 39]: Lady Cassandra had `` taken her up , '' and while other girls hung on season after season without sign of an admirer , Teresa at twenty-two had become engaged to the most eligible bachelor of the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 23]: At the present moment she had reached the zenith of her success , and was actually visiting `` in the county . ''
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 19]: Only those who have had their habitation in country towns can realise the devastating burden of public opinion .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 54]: In the first bitterness of disappointed love , Teresa could still think with a shudder of what `` they '' would say ; could imagine eyes peering from behind short blinds , hear the jangle of the bell announcing callers , sympathetically curious , and full of commiseration for the `` Poor Dear !
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 15]: ... '' It was torture to Teresa to think of becoming a Poor Dear !
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 6]: `` It 's no use .
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 6]: You ca n't live here .
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 7]: It would only mean -- Dane !
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 14]: have you thought for a moment what it _ would _ really mean ?
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 10]: Of course you will have to leave Chumley . ''
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 9]: `` Is it ` of course ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 8]: Her eyes rebuked him for his weakness .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 10]: `` It would be _ wicked _ to stay .
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 57]: The Squire would never have you in his house if he knew , but he would _ not _ know , and he would keep worrying you to go ... if you stayed away you would have to lie and pretend ; if you went , it would be just the same -- lies and pretence !
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 9]: And it would get worse , not better .
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 11]: There could be no happiness meeting each other like that .
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 5]: Only misery and deceit .
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 24]: Think of what it would be , and then of the other life , the life with me ... Doing right ... Comfort .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 5]: _ Peace _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 11]: The tears came now , and rolled down her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 30]: She looked very young , and pitiful , and appealing , with her hand stretched out towards him , the hand on which shone the ring he had given !
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 36]: Dane took that hand and folded it between his own , he was touched into tenderness by the girl 's clinging devotion , and his conscience told him that she was right in her prophecies .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 23]: He was one of the many Englishmen whose religion amounted to a determination to be straight in their dealings with their fellows .
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 42]: He knew himself to be guilty of many failings , but it had seemed inconceivable that he could ever stoop to double dealing , far less to the extremity of deceit involved in making love to the wife of a friend .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 60]: Six months ago had such a case been presented to him he would have tolerated no excuse , no palliation , would have poured forth condemnation with relentless lips , but now ... God knew his ideals were unchanged , God knew he wished to do the right , but he was no longer confident of his own strength .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 62]: If in the future he found himself alone with Cassandra , and she looked at him as she had looked for that one breathless moment , if her hand clung again to his , as it had clung , what about honour then , what about loyalty to his friend , and fealty to the girl to whom he was engaged ?
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 38]: By the beat in his heart , by the throb in his veins , he knew that such considerations would be but straws upon the wind , to be hurled aside by the rushing forces of nature .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 23]: Despicable , base , unworthy it might be , but if that moment came , it would find Cassandra in his arms !
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 27]: It came to this then , that there was only one course open to him as an honourable man , and that course was -- flight !
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 21]: He must leave Chumley , put a barrier of distance between himself and his temptation , and start life afresh .
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 7]: `` I made you happy once .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 12]: -- I could do it again if we were alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 17]: Teresa 's voice broke in upon his reverie , repeating her former argument in insistent tones .
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 20]: Her blue eyes were so wistful that it seemed cruel to point out the difference between then and now .
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 7]: Nevertheless it had to be done .
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 11]: `` I am afraid it would not be so easy .
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 9]: At that time I had no other thought .
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 7]: Now I _ know _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 16]: `` It is not going to make you happy to hanker after a married woman .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 6]: It will make you wicked .
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 15]: You will begin to wish in your own heart that he would -- die !
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 11]: It would be like committing a murder in your heart .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 67]: We are taught to pray to be delivered from temptation , it would be walking into it deliberately to stay here , -- to allow yourself to go on caring ... Oh , Dane , would n't it be better for you , would n't it , would n't it , to have me beside you , loving you , helping you , making a home ?
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 39]: I do n't say it could be the best thing -- the best thing is over -- but would n't it , would n't it , be better than loneliness , and wandering , or ... sin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 6]: Peignton looked at her helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 11]: The deadly logic of her words there was no denying .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 17]: A man must have been a stone who had failed to be touched by her earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 18]: `` Teresa , if it were possible -- anything that is possible I would promise at once .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 10]: But I can not face marrying just now . ''
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 10]: `` But you wo n't break it off ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 4]: Teresa cried eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 17]: She had now the first advantage in the fight , and her eye lightened with hope .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 21]: `` Promise me that , and we will leave the rest ... You can make an excuse and go abroad .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 15]: There was no time fixed for our wedding , so no one will talk .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 28]: And in a few months I could come out to you , and we could be married abroad , and travel until you heard of another post .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 7]: I 've always wanted to travel .
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 11]: You said you looked forward to showing me things . ''
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 5]: It was quite true .
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 31]: Dane as a world-traveller had found amusement in the country-bred girl 's primitive ideas of sightseeing , and had occupied occasional spare hours in sketching out programmes of imaginary tours .
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 22]: The remembrance came back to him with the remoteness of a childish dream , from which years had sapped the savour .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 30]: Then he had been interested , amused ; it had seemed a goodly task to act as Teresa 's guide ; now the prospect filled him with dreary dread .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 49]: He saw a mental picture of himself walking the sunlit streets , with a leaden heart , dragging through interminable lengths of galleries , sitting over _ tete-a-tete _ meals in crowded restaurants , obliged to talk , obliged to smile , and act the bridegroom 's part .
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 33]: With a wince of pain he saw himself and Teresa ensconced in a dream-like hotel on a dream-like Italian lake , watching happy lovers wander about a garden of almost unearthly beauty .
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 6]: Oh God , that beauty !
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 22]: How it would intensify every longing ; how hopelessly , maddeningly wretched a man might be , alone , in Eden !
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 18]: He did not speak , but his face spoke for him , and Teresa flushed and winced .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 33]: She had humbled her pride to the dust , but it was impossible any longer to blind herself to the fact that for the time being her influence over Dane was dead .
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 18]: He had no feeling left but the kindly pity which was but another stab to her heart .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 22]: Mind and heart alike were so filled by another image that there was no loophole by which she could enter in .
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 14]: For a bitter moment Teresa digested the fact , and faced the truth .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 20]: She had done her utmost and she had failed , there remained to her but one hope -- time !
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 21]: Given time and separation from the temptation her chance might return , but for the present she must stand aside .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 17]: One more argument remained to her , and that she had hoped need not be made .
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 8]: She braced herself now to deliver it .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 29]: `` For Lady Cassandra 's sake , it would be better if our engagement were not broken off now , when we are staying in the same house .
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 8]: People have noticed that you admire her .
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 5]: They might talk . ''
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 12]: He looked up quickly , and stretched out an impetuous hand .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 12]: `` That 's good of you -- to think of that !
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 13]: I would n't for the whole world drag her name into it .
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 29]: They 've no right to talk ; I 've given them no cause , but if there 's any fear ... _ Thank _ you , Teresa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 22]: His hand gripped hers , but for the first time the girl 's fingers remained limp and irresponsive in his grasp .
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 32]: She was horribly sore , horribly wounded , her endurance was at an end , she wanted to get away to her own room , and hide her head and cry .
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 11]: She rose and faced him with a grave young dignity .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 26]: `` I want you to understand that if she , Lady Cassandra , were free , I would give you back your promise at once !
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 36]: You would not have needed to ask me , I should have spoken myself ; but if I set you free because you love a married woman , I am helping you to -- sin !
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 6]: I wo n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 15]: You are engaged to me , and I shall keep you to your promise .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 16]: It is n't nice for a girl to have to force herself upon a man .
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 35]: If I did n't love you I could n't do it , but I do love you , and I know that some day you will understand , and be grateful to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 20]: She turned without allowing him time for a reply , and marched stiffly across the lawn towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 4]: THE CHAIN HOLDS .
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 10]: The next day Cassandra was still confined to bed .
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 36]: Grizel said that it would probably be some time before she was able to be about , and announced her own intention of acting as nurse , while her husband played golf with the Squire .
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 36]: So plain an intimation that visitors would be _ de trop _ went beyond a hint , and in truth Dane had already made up his mind to return home by the first possible train .
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 30]: That being so , it was obvious that Teresa must return with him , since it had been solely on his account that she had been invited at all .
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 52]: Peignton looked across the breakfast table around which the little party were seated , and Teresa met his eye , and said instantly as though she had been waiting for the sign : `` I think , Dane , it would be better if you and I went home this morning !
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 18]: I am afraid we can do nothing to help , and shall only be in the way .
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 15]: Could I have the carriage for the eleven o'clock train , Mrs Beverley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 33]: `` I will come with you , of course , '' Dane added , and Grizel shrugged her shoulders , and held out her hands with an eloquent little gesture of appeal .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 17]: `` Dear people , it 's most inhospitable and horrid , but I think so too !
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 9]: I sha n't have a moment to spare .
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 16]: I expect we shall be rushing home ourselves by the end of the week . ''
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 11]: The Squire and Martin looked uncomfortable , but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 38]: Plainly they also thought that the lovers would be better away , so Teresa excused herself and went upstairs to pack her box , an operation which she could not be persuaded to leave to a maid .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 55]: With care and contrivance she could contrive to give the effect of a wardrobe that was sufficient , though not in any degree to be compared to those of her two hostesses , but the gimlet-like eyes of a lady 's maid would speedily discover and despise the little contrivances inevitable to small means .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 14]: Teresa had the true middle-class dread of what servants would `` think . ''
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 21]: She had discussed with other Chumley girls the horror of staying in houses where a maid `` poked about . ''
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 18]: One friend in especial had recounted a thrilling incident which had befallen her on a recent visit .
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 54]: For the purpose of impressing the maid she had borrowed from a married sister her very smartest `` nightie , '' a cobweb confection of lawn and lace , which , discreetly crumpled , was hung over a chair in the morning , the while the utility flannelette was locked in a drawer .
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 33]: All went well , until one fateful morning , when , on the arrival of early tea , drowsiness overcame discretion , and the flanneletted figure had reared upright in the bed .
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 18]: `` My dear , '' concluded the sufferer tragically , `` I could have _ died _ !
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 9]: ... After that her manner entirely changed . ''
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 18]: It was a sorry task , refilling that box which had been packed with such high hopes .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 40]: As she folded ribbons , and stuffed tissue paper into the sleeves of dresses , Teresa could recall the exact sentiments which had been in her mind as she had gone through the same process a few days before .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 19]: Dane liked blue , so she had decided to wear the new blue dress on the first evening .
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 17]: The new sports coat was green , which suited her fairness almost as well as blue .
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 21]: She would wear that when they went out walking together , and he would slip his hand through her arm .
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 25]: There was a filmy white scarf which she had intended to throw over her shoulders when they escaped together into the garden after dinner .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 11]: That scarf had never been taken out of its wrappings .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 6]: It had never been required .
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 28]: The visit to which she had looked forward , as she had looked forward to nothing else in her life , had ended in tragedy and upheaval .
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 49]: An ordinary girl would have assuredly shed tears over such a packing , but Teresa was not given to tears ; moreover , in another hour she would be starting on a _ tete-a-tete _ journey with Dane , and a disfigured face would not help her cause .
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 32]: She recognised the fact , and set her lips , refusing to give way to the choky sensation in her throat , to the pricking at the back of her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 19]: Tears were for those who had lost hope , and she had not yet come to that pass .
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 10]: If much was lost , a great deal remained .
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 6]: She would go on fighting .
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 9]: Downstairs Teresa made her adieux with smiling composure .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 25]: It was Grizel who cried , crumpling her tiny handkerchief into a ball , and dabbing at her eyes without an effort at concealment .
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 40]: The curse of a vivid imagination was presenting to her the inner tragedy of the journey ahead , when the two who were supposedly lovers were left alone together for leaden hours which should have been winged with joy .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 29]: She envisaged the home-coming too , the flood of maternal questionings , the blankness of spirit which would descend upon the girl when she attempted to settle down .
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 44]: While Teresa had been packing her trunk Grizel had been with her in spirit , feeling the reflex of every pang , and now as the carriage drove from the door she cried unrestrainedly , to her husband 's mingled bewilderment and concern .
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 8]: `` Are you sorry they are gone ?
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 14]: You said you would have no time ... '' `` I have n't .
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 23]: I 'm glad ; but , oh , Martin , I _ am _ Teresa at this moment , and it hurts !
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 13]: I know exactly how she suffers ... '' `` That 's impossible .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 18]: Teresa could never feel in your way , and besides , dearest , why should she suffer ?
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 16]: She 's not such a baby as to grouse over a few days ' visit .
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 8]: Especially when she has her man . ''
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 46]: Martin knew nothing of the awkwardness of the position , and Grizel realised that she must appear hysterical in his eyes , and longed to pour out the whole tale , but it would not do ; for everyone 's sake it would not do .
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 17]: There might come a time when his unconsciousness would be the greatest boon to all concerned .
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 12]: `` It 's all the fault of my beastly imagination ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 4]: she sniffed ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 32]: `` I 'm always living through other people 's dramas , and tearing my heart to fiddle-strings imagining how I should agonise and despair if I were in the same place .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 25]: You said one day that it was easy to be philosophical about a neighbour 's toothache , but it is n't easy to me .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 30]: I feel the horrid thing leaping inside my own mouth , and stabbing up to my own ear , and taste the nasty chlorodyney cotton-wool in my own mouth .
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 9]: I 'm such a sensitive little thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 13]: `` You 're a little goose , '' Martin said , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 37]: `` In nine cases out of ten , while you have been torturing yourself , the toothache has stopped , or the poor martyr has shaken off his troubles , and gone off to play golf .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 22]: We ca n't carry other people 's burdens for them , darling , they 've got to struggle through by themselves .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 18]: It 's curious with your happy temperament , that you should have such a lurid imagination . ''
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 7]: `` No , it is n't !
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 6]: Not a bit curious . ''
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 5]: `` Is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 3]: Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 7]: I 'm interested to hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 17]: `` Because I imagine happy things as well , stupid , and they come out top .
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 15]: If I worry over other people 's troubles , I glory in their joy .
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 22]: You ca n't do one without the other ; if you do n't feel one you ca n't feel the other .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 39]: You may never shed a tear in your life over an imaginary woe , but _ have _ you ever wakened in the morning and thanked God because the housemaid 's young man had come home from abroad ?
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 32]: -- Have you ever felt your soul flooded with joy when you saw the sun shining in through pink and white curtains on to a brand-new wall-paper you had just chosen ?
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 21]: Did you feel as if you could have jumped over the moon , when the Czarina had a son ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 9]: `` I -- I was very glad . ''
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 7]: `` Well , I was n't !
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 36]: I cried with joy , and said my prayers all day long , and thought of her lying there , and hugged the thought of her happiness , the poor , beautiful , tragic thing !
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 30]: What _ do _ you do , may I ask , if one of your own friends is in trouble , and does n't see the way out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 18]: `` I -- er , -- well , if I can help him , I invariably do .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 10]: For my own sake , as well as his .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 4]: I like helping .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 15]: Take it all round , it is the most agreeable sensation one can have .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 23]: If the other fellow feels as light-hearted and generally bucked up afterwards as I do myself , he is jolly well off .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 11]: But if I ca n't -- '' `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 5]: I do n't worry .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 5]: What 's the use ?
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 17]: It would do him no good for me to be miserable as well as himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 23]: `` The thought of him does n't follow you wherever you go , like a nightmare , squeezing up your heart ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 9]: `` Do n't mix your metaphors , darling .
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 3]: That squeezes .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 3]: Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 6]: I should call it weakness .
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 8]: I dismiss it from my mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 25]: `` Well , I think you are a callous wretch , and I like my own disposition a million times better than yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 11]: `` There is no discussion on that point is there ?
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 7]: because I most heartily agree . ''
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 8]: `` There you are , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 4]: cried Grizel triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 9]: `` But you _ will _ argue . ''
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 29]: She shook out the damp ball of a handkerchief , and held it flag-ways to the breeze , tilting her head to look into her husband 's face .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 8]: `` Do I look very plain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 7]: `` Comparatively speaking -- yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 60]: replied Martin , seizing on his revenge , whereupon Grizel proceeded to declaim in a loud , artificial voice : ... '' ` Teardrops still lingered on the long eyelashes ; the lovely , mutinous face was wasted and ravaged with grief , yet never in her most queenly moments had she appeared to him more alluring and sweet .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 12]: For weal or woe his life was in her hands . '
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 13]: ... Another fine instalment to be given in our next number ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 25]: She waved her hand and turned back to the house , while Martin , laughing , walked across the lawn to join the Squire .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 45]: Meantime Peignton and Teresa had reached the station , and he was unhappily facing a two hours ' journey which might easily devolve itself into a _ tete-a-tete _ , since considerate travellers have a habit of avoiding carriages occupied by interesting-looking young couples .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 32]: He was divided between a horror of a repetition of the scene in the garden the day before , and an overpowering sympathy for the girl whom he wished to avoid .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 30]: Her set composure went to his heart when he recalled the radiance of the face which had beamed at him in the same place only a few days before .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 24]: She had been so happy , poor girl , so fond , so unsuspicious ; and now ... Teresa turned towards him hastily .
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 14]: `` You will go in a smoker , Dane , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 5]: I am tired out .
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 9]: I expect I shall sleep all the way .
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 15]: Come for me at the Junction , in case I am carried on . ''
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 26]: She stepped into a carriage , and moved towards the farther side , arranging impedimenta upon the seat , with her back turned towards him .
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 47]: There was no time to wait , for he was obliged to move along quickly to take his own seat , but though the alertness of relief showed in his movements , his heart went out towards his _ fiancee _ with a rush of gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 12]: How kind , how considerate , how singularly wise and far-seeing !
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 55]: Most girls , he was convinced , would have manoeuvred for a _ tete-a-tete _ , and turned the journey into a torture of tears and reproaches , but Teresa had voluntarily sent him away , and had done so , moreover , in a natural , commonplace fashion free from trace of offence .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 4]: Bravo , Teresa !
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 27]: As he took his seat in a corner of the smoker Peignton was probably more warmly her admirer than at any previous moment in their acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 19]: A sensible , level-headed woman , who would help , not hinder through the hard moments of life .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 41]: Mentally he took off his cap to Teresa ; but when he had lighted a cigarette he fell back into dreams of another woman who was neither practical nor level-headed , as admirers of sensible women are apt to do .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 68]: As for Teresa , she cursed herself a hundred times over for having thrown away a valuable opportunity , but her resolution not to harass Dane in this first miserable day of indecision sprang into life again at the sight of his worn face when he came to join her at the Junction , and she braced herself afresh to help him through the ordeal of arrival .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 27]: Mrs Mallison had been prepared by wire for her daughter 's sudden return , and her curiosity was at boiling point as to the reasons thereof .
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 23]: The statement that Lady Cassandra was ill , and Mrs Beverley engaged in nursing , was far too vague to prove satisfying .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 36]: She wanted to hear what nature of ill , how long an ill , how serious an ill , with details of the premonitory symptoms , and the precise circumstances under which they had developed .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 24]: She waved the way towards the dining-room , explaining that lunch had been delayed half , an hour for the travellers ' benefit .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 10]: Of course Dane would stay and take pot luck .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 6]: Mutton haricot and gooseberry fool .
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 31]: `` You can tell us all about it over lunch , and afterwards , '' she added meaningly , `` Teresa and you can have a nice quiet afternoon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 15]: Peignton quailed at the prospect , but once again Teresa came to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 8]: `` Dane is very tired , mother .
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 5]: We are both tired .
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 8]: He is going straight home to rest .
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 24]: Be sure you _ do _ rest , Dane , '' she added , turning towards him , and holding out her hand .
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 13]: `` I sha n't expect to see you again until Sunday . ''
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 15]: `` I am quite sure he wo n't agree to _ that _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 67]: Mrs Mallison declared , and continued to protest volubly against Dane 's departure , and to sing the praises of the haricot and fool , but her flutters had no power against the inflexibility of Teresa 's calm , and finally she realised her defeat , and scurried back to shut the dining-room door , with the obvious intention of giving privacy to a tender farewell .
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 14]: `` You are very good to me , Teresa , '' Dane said .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 40]: The next second he realised that he was expressing gratitude to his _ fiancee _ , for giving him a chance of escaping her own society , and the realisation infused an added warmth into his last words . ''
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 8]: _ Thank _ you , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 16]: Quite simply and naturally Teresa lifted her arms , and clasped them round his neck .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 27]: She did not kiss him , but she laid her fresh , cool cheek against his , and said : `` I love you , Dane .
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 9]: I shall always be good to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 24]: Peignton went out into the road hating himself because the sound of that `` always '' had dried up the spring of tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 16]: God help him , he wanted nothing of this girl which should last for always !
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 29]: If he were free of her to-day he would remember her all his life with gratitude and affection , but those twining arms chafed him like a chain .
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 21]: Peignton took Teresa at her word , and paid no visit to the Cottage for the rest of the week .
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 35]: He sent down a hamper of flowers , however , with an envelope enclosing a short note written on his thickest paper , which to the maternal eye might give the effect of length .
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 45]: He would not be less careful of Teresa 's feelings than she had been of his , and he knew well that to allow three days to pass without visit or message would stamp him in Mrs Mallison 's eyes as neglectful and unappreciative .
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 14]: The best flowers which the hothouses afforded were collected to fill that hamper .
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 36]: Since the announcement of his engagement it had been an understanding that Peignton should spend Sunday with the Mallisons , appearing in time for early dinner , and remaining until after the eight o'clock supper .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 48]: In the afternoon he and Teresa sat in the morning room together , or walked into the country , and after tea he played a game of chess with the Major , while from the drawing-room came the sound of hymn tunes played on a cracked piano .
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 30]: Mrs Mallison had been `` brought up to hymn tunes '' after tea on Sunday afternoons , and commandeered her daughters to produce her old favourites for her delectation .
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 37]: `` The Church 's one foundation '' led the way to `` Onward , Christian soldiers , '' while `` Oh come , all ye faithful , '' enjoyed a vogue independent of time or season .
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 82]: Sometimes Teresa sang the words in a strong soprano voice , an excellent voice for a choir , but a trifle harsh when heard by itself , but one afternoon , during one of the protracted pauses which preceded the Major 's moves , Peignton 's ear was attracted by a new tune , played with a softer touch , and presently another voice began to sing , a soft , somewhat tremulous voice , with a quality of extraordinary sweetness .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 30]: The hymn was `` Abide with me , '' and the sound of the well-known words sung in that soft , tremulous voice brought back a hundred boyish memories .
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 50]: That was the hymn which he had liked best in the old knickerbocker days when he trotted to church with his parents ; that was the favourite closing hymn at the school chapel ; away on the Indian plains he had heard his men whistling it over their work .
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 21]: On the impulse of the moment Peignton pushed back his chair , and crossed the little hall to the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 37]: The door was intentionally left ajar , owing to Mrs Mallison 's persistent belief that `` Papa liked to hear the music , '' so that Dane found himself able to see , without being seen .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 44]: Teresa was not present , Mrs Mallison lay back in an easy chair , her eyes closed , her head swaying to and fro in time with the music ; at the piano sat -- could he believe the evidence of his senses ?
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 20]: -- Mary Mallison herself , that machine-like automaton in human form , whom he had believed incapable of feeling !
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 42]: Through the chink of the door Peignton stared for one incredulous moment at the bloodless lips through which breathed those low , crooning notes , then drew noiselessly back , with a tingling in his veins which was curiously like shame .
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 18]: He had caught a glimpse of a naked soul , and the revelation filled him with distress .
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 24]: No woman could have that note in her voice , and not possess the power of feeling an acuteness of joy or grief .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 17]: No woman could have it who had not already tasted the sweets and bitters of experience .
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 16]: But if Mary could feel , how could she endure the life that was hers ?
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 39]: As he went slowly back to his game , Peignton had his first glimpse into the tragedy of the life of a woman to whom nature has bequeathed a sensitive heart , and a plain and unattractive exterior .
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 40]: Sunday in the Mallison _ menage _ was not at the best of times a cheerful occasion , though hitherto Teresa 's society had made it bearable ; under the new conditions it became a penance difficult to endure .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 9]: The one o'clock dinner was invariably the same .
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 30]: Roast beef and Yorkshire pudding , a pie made of the fruit in season , flanked by custard in glasses ; biscuits and cheese , and a sketchy dessert .
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 9]: Mrs Mallison invariably discussed the morning 's sermon .
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 12]: Teresa invariably disagreed , and the Major preserved a dejected silence .
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 23]: To Peignton 's supersensitive sight it had appeared sometimes as if each daughter had assumed a startling likeness to a separate parent .
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 13]: Mary had her father 's features , her father 's shrinking air .
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 10]: Teresa -- why had he never noticed it before ?
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 10]: -- Teresa was a youthful replica of her mother .
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 15]: Given another twenty years she would develop into the same stout , bustling matron .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 17]: His flesh crept at the thought of sitting opposite to her in the Major 's place .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 48]: In the afternoon Teresa suggested reading in the garden as an alternative to the usual walk ; she also announced that Mr Hunter and his sister were `` coming in '' to tea , an innovation in the day 's programme for which Peignton was devoutly thankful .
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 29]: He had met the young doctor and his sister , and knew them to be lively , talkative young people , eminently capable of rolling the conversation ball .
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 15]: Their presence would prevent personalities , and keep the talk away from dreaded topics .
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 15]: Never in his life had he accorded a more cordial welcome to comparative strangers .
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 28]: The table was set beneath a tree in the garden , and Teresa in her white dress made an attractive figure against the green of the background .
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 44]: Her hair was carefully dressed , a touch of blue at the throat intensified the blue of her eyes ; there was in her manner that touch of self-consciousness and artificiality which to a discerning eye bespoke the presence of an admiring male .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 25]: Roused to a momentary interest , Peignton realised that the admirer was not himself in this instance , but Hunter , the young doctor .
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 31]: He hovered about the table with eager looks ; he discovered what Teresa needed , as soon as she found it out for herself , and darted forward to help .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 42]: When she moved , his eyes followed her ; when she spoke , he was all ears ; and once , turning from the tea table , the young fellow knitted his brows , and stared fixedly into Peignton 's face .
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 12]: -- `` What does she see in _ You _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 27]: -- said that look as plainly as words could speak , and Dane , knowing himself to look weary and absent , felt an answering sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 46]: He roused himself to take part in the conversation , and for the rest of the evening was careful not to relapse into silence , but the whole thing was like a dream , a dull , long-drawn-out dream which had no connection with life .
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 21]: He was moving as in a dream , speaking with forced , unnatural words , but presently he would awake .
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 22]: All day long the sense of waiting was upon him , of doing time until a a certain period was reached .
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 20]: If this sort of thing were to continue , it would be unbearable , but it would not continue .
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 8]: There was a limit to his endurance .
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 22]: In a few days , in a week at longest , Cassandra would be home again , and they would meet !
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 11]: The sense of waiting grew stronger ... CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 4]: A CROWDED HOUR .
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 17]: An interminable period seemed to elapse before Peignton heard the news for which he was waiting .
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 48]: He had received one or two post-card bulletins from Grizel , and knew that the shock of the accident had left no lasting effect on Cassandra , but it was not until the morning of the tenth day that he heard of her arrival at the Court .
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 31]: His informant was a workman on the place , who mentioned having seen her ladyship driving , as a proof of that more interesting event , the Squire 's return .
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 11]: The natural enquiry , `` How did she look ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 33]: could , of course , not be asked under the circumstances , but Peignton knew that it would be impossible to exist for another twenty-four hours without settling that question for himself .
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 39]: If he had been asked what plans were in his mind he would have replied that he had none , yet deeply , subconsciously , during every one of those long ten days a plan had been shaping .
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 55]: When he left the house after lunch that afternoon , he knew exactly where he was going , and although he might delude himself that he was following a sudden impulse , it would have been in just that direction that he would have directed his steps on any one of the previous days .
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 19]: Half an hour 's brisk walking brought him to the northern gate leading into the Squire 's grounds .
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 19]: It was the farthest entrance from the house , but Peignton had no intention of visiting the house .
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 45]: The gate was but a short distance from the secluded summer-house in which Cassandra had given him tea on the afternoon on which they had run away from the incursion of afternoon callers , and it was to the summer-house that he was bound .
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 5]: Cassandra would be there .
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 28]: He knew it as certainly as though he had had her written word of promise , and he knew also that she would be awaiting his arrival .
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 31]: Such knowledge is not to be accounted for in ordinary terms , nor is it given to all , but those who have once heard the voice recognise and obey .
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 41]: Peignton quickened his footsteps as he passed the lodge , then turned down a small grassy path , followed its windings for a few hundred yards , and saw before him the timbered roof , with its drapings of ivy .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 38]: The window was in front , level with the door , so that he could not see into the interior ; but if Cassandra were there she would hear his footsteps and know that he was approaching .
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 31]: The last yards stretched long as a mile , the laboured beating of his heart seemed to mount to his throat , he set his teeth , and went forward .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 35]: The next moment he saw her , even as his mind had pictured , seated on a low cane chair , her hands clasping its arms , her face bent forward to greet him .
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 42]: She wore a white dress over which a knitted silk coat of a bright rose-red hung loosely apart ; her hat lay on the table by her side , and the dark wings of her hair fell low over her brow .
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 34]: Seen through the arch of greenery which covered the doorway , the colours of her dress attained an added vividness , and the beauty of face and figure were thrown into fullest relief .
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 28]: She looked like a princess imprisoned by the evil genii of the forest ; like an enchanted princess watching for the prince who should set her free .
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 23]: For one moment Peignton paused silently , his eyes meeting hers , then he crossed the threshold and stood by her side .
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 36]: Neither had spoken , neither had affected any sign of astonishment , and now as he stood waiting , Cassandra lifted her face to his and said simply : `` I knew you would come .
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 7]: I was waiting for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 14]: `` I knew you would be here , '' replied Peignton as simply .
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 20]: He sat down on the seat next hers and looked into her face with a long , lingering glance .
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 56]: The last time he had seen that face it had been marked with bruises made by his own hands ; the bruises had disappeared , nevertheless this was not Cassandra 's face as he had known it ; there was something new in its expression , something wonderful , something that thrilled to his heart .
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 20]: Instinctively he held out his hand , and in an instant hers lay inside it , warm and close .
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 38]: The great lady had disappeared ; it was a girl who was sitting beside him , a girl with soft Irish eyes and a soft Irish voice which spoke impulsively , asking tremulous question : `` Dane !
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 6]: Is it my fault ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 7]: `` Your fault that I. . .
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 4]: _ care _ ?
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 46]: Only in so far as you are yourself ... Once I had met you , the rest was bound to follow ; but I never dreamt ... I never dared to dream that you -- '' `` But I did , '' she said quickly .
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 4]: `` I did !
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 22]: I cared first ; before you thought of me ... That is why I asked if it was my fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 39]: `` I have always loved you , but I did n't understand ... Cassandra , there are some things a man ca n't say , but that night -- I had no intention of getting engaged to Teresa .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 14]: We ... the car ... there was an accident ... she was afraid .
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 21]: I _ had _ intended to propose to her months before , when I knew you only as a name .
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 48]: I had given her every reason to suppose that I should ... There is not a word to be said against Teresa , but _ that _ night I had come straight from you ... I do n't want you to think -- '' `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 10]: Cassandra turned her hand to clasp his more firmly .
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 8]: `` Need we talk of her now ?
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 3]: I know .
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 3]: I understand !
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 11]: We make mistakes ; have n't I made my own ?
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 18]: but they are past , they ca n't be helped , and now -- we are together !
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 6]: I have waited so long .
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 60]: I do n't want to talk of her , or of anyone else , but just ourselves ... '' Her eyes met his ; their message was the same as that of the lips , the beautiful vivid face was close to his own , he saw it with a clearness of detail which had never before been possible .
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 21]: The dark eyelashes grew thickly on the lower lids ; underneath the lids the skin had a faint bluish shade .
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 25]: Was that the explanation of the tired look which , even in moments of animation , gave a touch of pathos to her air ?
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 22]: The quality of pathos was there at that moment , and with it a fragility which gripped at Dane 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 20]: He forgot everything but the dearness of her , the nearness of her , the wonder of her love .
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 25]: With an impetuous movement he held out his arms and she met him half-way , swaying into them with a soft murmur of joy .
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 53]: That which Dane had foreseen had come to pass : he had confessed his love to his friend 's wife , and she lay wrapped in his arms , yet there was no feeling of guilt in his heart at that moment , and he knew that Cassandra herself felt equally guiltless .
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 24]: The overpowering forces of nature had hurled them together , and they clung helplessly , like two children , dismayed by the dark .
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 3]: `` Dane !
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 3]: Dane ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 13]: sighed Cassandra tremblingly , `` I wanted you , I wanted you !
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 33]: It has been so long lying there alone , all these days , hearing nothing , knowing nothing , having no one to speak to ... '' `` Mrs Beverley -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 5]: `` I could n't .
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 5]: I was n't sure .
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 47]: It was all so misty and confused at the time that I did not know how much the others had heard ... Your voice sounded to me like a trumpet call , bringing me back to life , but it might have been only a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 19]: I could n't tell if she knew , and until I did , I could n't speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 7]: `` And she never -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 4]: Grizel would n't .
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 7]: She was just her natural self .
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 7]: _ Did _ she know then ?
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 11]: You talk as if ... Did they both know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 5]: Peignton bowed his head .
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 2]: Both .
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 5]: There was no disguise .
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 19]: There was only one thing in the world for me at that moment , and that was you .
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 11]: Heaven knows what I said , but it was enough .
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 9]: Fate has been against us all the way .
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 15]: If it had not been for that accident , no one need have known .
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 10]: -- I could have kept it to myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 11]: `` Oh , Dane , would that have been better ?
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 10]: Do you think that would have helped me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 4]: Cassandra asked pitifully .
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 24]: `` There is only one thing that makes life endurable at this moment , and that is that I _ do _ know .
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 13]: It 's wicked ; it 's selfish ; but it 's true !
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 6]: I was starving with loneliness .
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 24]: All those dreadful days at the sea when she was there , and I saw you together , I was longing to die .
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 25]: It seemed as if I could not endure to go on with life , but when death really came near , I was frightened .
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 9]: It 's terrible to feel your breath go .
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 54]: I think for a few moments I must have lost consciousness , for I remember nothing after you seized hold of me , until I was lying -- like this -- with my head on your shoulder , and you were saying -- saying ... '' Peignton 's breath came in a groan .
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 6]: `` Did I say it ?
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 14]: I mean , am I more responsible than for the breath I drew ?
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 14]: What I said to you then , Cassandra , _ said itself _ .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 25]: If I had been in my sane senses , I would have killed myself rather than have said them then -- before her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 10]: Cassandra lifted her fringed eyelids in a questioning gaze .
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 16]: `` For my own sake I am glad ; but it was hard for her .
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 3]: Poor Teresa !
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 15]: Was she -- did she ... What has happened between you , Dane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 5]: `` Nothing has happened .
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 8]: We had it out , of course .
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 4]: The next day .
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 16]: Before we came home I wanted to set her free , but she refused . ''
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 3]: `` Refused !
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 5]: But how could she ?
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 5]: When she _ knew !
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 7]: Why _ did she refuse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 6]: Dane flushed in miserable discomfort .
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 35]: `` If you had been free , she would have broken the engagement herself , but she believes that it would make things harder for -- for us both , if she stood aside .
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 24]: She thinks we might be tempted to -- to -- '' `` What _ are _ we going to do , Dane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 4]: Cassandra asked simply .
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 27]: `` Is n't it strange how one comes up against problems in life , and how different they are in reality from what one has imagined ?
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 23]: I 've heard of married women falling in love with other men , and meeting them , as we have met now .
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 7]: It seemed so despicable and mean .
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 18]: I felt nothing but contempt , but we are not contemptible ; we have done no wrong .
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 18]: We needed each other , and all the barriers in the world could n't keep us apart .
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 7]: We are sitting -- like this !
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 12]: -- but I do n't feel that I am doing wrong .
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 4]: It helps me .
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 70]: If I could meet you here -- not often -- just now and then for half an hour , a quarter of an hour , and could put my head on your shoulder , and feel your arms holding me tight -- I could go on ... I could be better -- '' Peignton shook his head , and a dreary travesty of a smile passed over his face .
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 25]: He was marvelling for the hundredth time at the extraordinary difference between a woman 's sense of honour , and that of a man .
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 58]: He could have set his teeth and stolen his friend 's wife , carrying her off boldly in the face of the world , prepared to pay the price , but it would have been impossible for him to continue a series of clandestine meetings , however innocent , and still hold out the hand of friendship .
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 14]: Cassandra was not the type of woman to desert her home and child .
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 26]: She had made a vow , and she would keep it , yet she could declare that she would be the stronger for such meetings .
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 3]: Poor darling !
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 7]: she meant it in all sincerity .
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 12]: He would never allow her the misery of discovering her mistake .
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 8]: `` No , '' he said firmly .
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 6]: `` Never that , Cassandra .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 8]: It has to be all or nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 11]: There 's no midway course possible for you and me .
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 19]: I love you ; there 's nothing in the wide world that counts with me , beside you .
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 31]: If you could trust yourself to me , I would swear to serve you until my death , and it would be joy , the truest joy I could know .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 34]: It is for you to order , Cassandra , and I shall obey ... '' He felt her shrink in his arms ; her voice trembled , but she forced herself to speak .
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 6]: `` What do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 11]: Say it plainly , Dane , please , quite plainly .
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 5]: Let me understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 15]: `` If you will come with me , Cassandra , we 'll go abroad .
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 16]: I 'll take a villa in some quiet spot , out of the tourist beat .
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 25]: We could stay there , together , until ... He would divorce you ; he is not the kind of man to shirk that .
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 26]: The case would be undefended , so you would not have to appear ... In less than a year we could be legally married . ''
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 11]: `` But -- but -- _ my boy _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 5]: cried Cassandra , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 24]: She passed her right hand against Peignton 's shoulder , the hand with the emerald ring , and raised herself from his embrace .
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 22]: There was a look in her eyes which he had not seen before , the mother-look on guard for her young .
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 44]: It was not of the stolid , freckled-faced schoolboy that Cassandra was thinking at that moment , but of the small , soft-breathing thing which had been the reward of her anguish , which she had greeted with such a passion of joy .
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 3]: `` Dane !
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 7]: have you forgotten my boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 5]: I have forgotten nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 13]: Is the boy more to you than I am , Cassandra ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 11]: No , '' she turned to him with eager penitence .
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 18]: `` Not so much ; not so much ; but he is mine ; I am responsible .
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 15]: And he is growing so big -- in a few years he would understand .
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 18]: ... Even now the other boys -- I have done very little for him in his life .
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 15]: I have been allowed to do so little , and he is n't affectionate .
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 26]: It is n't me personally that he would miss ... a new gun , or a pony would more than make up _ now _ !
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 7]: But he _ would _ care !
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 11]: ... The time would come when he would be ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 18]: -- I could n't bear my own little son to be ashamed of me , Dane ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 11]: There was no answer to be made to that protest .
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 15]: Dane stared at the ground , miserably conscious of the hopelessness of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 28]: He was determined to keep to his resolution that it should be all or nothing between Cassandra and himself , yet the prospect of parting was intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 10]: `` Are you thinking entirely of the boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 8]: he asked slowly , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 4]: `` Your husband ?
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 9]: Does n't he enter into your calculations ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 5]: Cassandra 's face hardened .
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 8]: `` No , '' she said coldly .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 8]: `` I am not thinking of Bernard .
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 13]: If there were only Bernard to consider , it would be different .
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 15]: Bernard has not kept his promise to love and cherish me all his life .
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 14]: I am a live woman , and he treats me like a machine .
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 11]: A man like that has no right to a wife .
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 20]: If I left him , it would open his eyes to his own selfishness , and do him good .
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 14]: He would marry again , and his second wife would reap the benefit .
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 33]: You need me more than Bernard needs me , and I need you ... But there 's the boy -- '' `` And , '' said Peignton heavily , `` Teresa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 13]: Cassandra glanced at him swiftly , and into her eyes came fear .
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 17]: `` Dane ... will you , can you , -- marry her _ new _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 19]: `` I have told her that it 's impossible , but she insisted on keeping on the engagement .
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 30]: I stood out , but she said that possibly your name might be dragged in if the engagement were broken off just now , after our visit to you .
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 17]: -- I could not stand the risk of that , so -- it was left ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 10]: `` And you are engaged to her still ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 3]: `` Nominally .
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 5]: She is very considerate .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 19]: She makes it as easy for me as she can ... That 's a hateful thing to say !
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 7]: I hate myself for saying it .
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 13]: If it 's hard for us , it 's harder for her .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 7]: She 's the one left out .
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 7]: She might have made things unbearable .
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 41]: Can you imagine what it would have been if she had blurted out the whole tale , -- told it to her own people , to have it handed round the neighbourhood , with a hundred exaggerations within twenty-four hours ?
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 25]: A girl might so easily have lost her head under the circumstances , but she -- I do n't think she reproached me once !
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 14]: She seemed all the way through to think of me more than herself .
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 9]: -- I never saw her more sweet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 24]: A vision of Teresa had come into his mind as with flushing cheeks she had said , `` There might be children ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 18]: Many times over had he recalled that moment , and always with the same tenderness and pain .
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 17]: Cassandra recognised the note in his voice , and felt a very human pang of jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 11]: `` What did she say about _ Me _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 8]: `` You and I count as one .
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 4]: We must do .
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 7]: There 's no considering us apart .
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 23]: She fears that if I were free , it would be one barrier removed , and we should be the more tempted .
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 33]: -- By holding me to my word , she is doing all that is in her power to prevent -- '' Cassandra 's short upper lip curved with a touch of scorn .
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 18]: It touched her pride that insignificant Teresa Mallison should presume to lay down rules for her guidance .
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 30]: It had pleased her to admit the girl to a certain amount of intimacy , but always it had been she who had condescended , Teresa who gratefully received .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 27]: Cassandra was not a snob , but she was an Earl 's daughter , and the consciousness of her birth was very present at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 18]: `` It seems , '' she said coldly , `` that we are in Teresa 's hands !
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 13]: She has given you her orders , and you have obeyed . ''
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 16]: Then Peignton looked at her , and she quailed before the passion in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 21]: `` Give me _ your _ orders , '' he said thickly , `` and she goes , everything goes !
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 55]: I 'll throw over the whole thing to-night , work , honour , friends -- everything there is , if you will give me yourself -- if you 'll come to me to-night , and let me take you away -- Oh , my Beautiful , if you only would ... '' `` Dane !
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 3]: Dane ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 12]: cried Cassandra sharply , '' _ I want to _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 17]: She covered her face with her hands , and he wrapped her close to his heart .
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 5]: `` Am I wicked ?
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 4]: Am I wicked ?
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 35]: I 've always called a woman wicked who felt like this , but it seems now as if it would be so right , so natural : so much more natural than saying good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 11]: But I ca n't -- I ca n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 6]: I 'm bound with chains .
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 14]: It 's the boy 's home ... '' They clung together in silence .
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 19]: On this point at least there was nothing more to be said , and each realised as much .
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 29]: The chains might tear Cassandra 's heart , but they would not give way , for they were forged out of the strongest sentiment of the human heart .
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 12]: The mother in her would not stain her boy 's home .
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 16]: In the midst of his misery , Peignton loved her the more for her loyalty .
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 20]: Presently she spoke again in a low , exhausted voice : `` Dane -- what shall you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 3]: `` I ?
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 7]: Leave Chumley as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 4]: Go somewhere else .
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 6]: It does n't matter where .
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 3]: Nothing matters .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 9]: But I must clear out of this . ''
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 5]: `` Is it necessary ?
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 6]: If we meet very seldom ?
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 11]: Never , if you think it better , in private !
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 11]: Would it really be easier if you never saw me ?
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 15]: I do n't feel as if I can live if I lose you altogether .
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 16]: Even to see you driving past in the street -- '' Peignton shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 5]: `` It 's impossible .
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 7]: The thing could not be worked .
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 7]: The Squire would ask me here .
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 6]: I could not always refuse .
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 18]: I could n't stand it , Cassandra ; it would be too much for flesh and blood .
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 8]: It must be all or nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 8]: `` You wo n't go at once ?
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 9]: I must see you again ; I must !
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 3]: I must !
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 7]: There is so much to say .
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 11]: I 'm going to do what is right , Dane .
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 17]: I 'm strong enough for that , but I must have _ something _ for myself !
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 28]: You will meet me again , just once , to -- to say good-bye -- '' Her voice broke , and the tears poured down her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 14]: Dane kissed them away , murmuring passionate words , promising everything she asked .
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 18]: If they were to part for a lifetime , fate need not grudge them a short hour .
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 23]: He promised , and Cassandra lay silent with closed eyes , her hands clinging to his , her cheek touching his own .
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 25]: In both minds was the thought of the barren years to come when they would remember this hour as a treasure snatched from fate .
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 21]: This was the golden time , the fleeting glory , -- let them realise , let them make the most !
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 12]: Neither spoke ; it seemed a waste of time to speak .
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 30]: Dane lifted the beautiful hands and gazed at them with adoring eyes ; Cassandra lifted his in her turn , and found their sun-baked strength every whit as beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 35]: They looked into each other 's eyes , deeply , endlessly , as lovers look who are about to part , and the world and all that is in it has ceased to exist .
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 21]: Footsteps came along the winding path but they did not hear ; light , tripping footsteps drawing nearer and nearer .
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 12]: They reached the summer-house , and halted before the opened door .
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 4]: `` Cassandra ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 5]: said a quiet voice .
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 5]: `` It 's me .
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 5]: It 's Grizel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 3]: ENTER GRIZEL .
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 19]: Cassandra lifted her head and stared blankly , then with cold displeasure , into the intruder 's face .
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 24]: There was not the faintest tinge of embarrassment in her mien , nothing but surprise , and anger , and an intolerable impatience .
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 34]: She sat in silence , struggling to collect her thoughts , and the while she stared , Grizel stepped lightly over the threshold , and seated herself on one of the scattered chairs .
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 32]: It was done so quickly that there was no time for protest , if protest had been possible , and Cassandra , biting her lip , turned towards Dane for support .
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 26]: He had risen to his feet , and looked miserable and embarrassed as a man is bound to do when placed in an awkward situation .
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 25]: Cassandra looked for signs of an anger corresponding to her own , failed to find it , and in consequence felt angrier than before .
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 8]: Her voice was steely in its hauteur .
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 9]: `` Did you wish to see me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 4]: `` Please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 4]: said Grizel softly .
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 20]: Her hazel eyes met Peignton 's with a long , straight glance , whose message he could not misunderstand .
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 9]: He flushed , and held out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 15]: `` I 'll go ... Good-bye -- '' `` I shall see you again .
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 10]: I am free on Wednesday and on Friday . ''
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 15]: Cassandra spoke in a heightened voice , as though scorning an attempt at deceit .
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 8]: `` You will meet me here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 28]: I 'll let you know -- '' He dropped her hand , bowed slightly to Grizel , and swung rapidly away , leaving the two women alone .
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 15]: `` Grizel Beverley , '' said Cassandra deliberately , `` I hate you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 5]: `` Poor darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 5]: said Grizel , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 7]: `` Of course you do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 15]: She shook out a minute handkerchief , and wiped the moisture from her face .
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 12]: It dawned on Cassandra 's perceptions that she was deathly pale .
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 7]: `` Why did you come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 7]: `` Was it just chance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 5]: Grizel 's lip trembled .
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 19]: `` Cassandra , I loathe to preach ; but I do n't believe it _ was _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 8]: `` How did you get here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 4]: `` I walked .
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 10]: It 's the longest walk I 've ever taken .
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 10]: I never came in by the north gate before .
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 8]: I 've never turned up this path .
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 6]: I just -- came ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 4]: `` I see .
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 21]: It was a coincidence , which you are trying to turn into a special guidance of Providence on my behalf .
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 13]: I 'm sorry that I can not recognise it in that light .
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 24]: I wish with all my heart that you had stayed away ... What good do you suppose you are going to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 11]: `` The Lord knows , '' said Grizel , shrugging .
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 12]: The next moment , with a startled air , she continued .
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 7]: `` He _ does _ know !
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 21]: I said that without thinking , but it 's true ... Wo n't you let me help you , darling ?
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 10]: I 'm not a bit shocked , you see .
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 16]: I knew before , and I 'm not a chicken , -- I 'm twenty-eight .
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 10]: I know that love does n't work to order .
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 23]: I was horribly afraid for you before that day on the cliff , and then of course I _ knew _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 9]: `` How many people have you told ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 4]: Grizel was silent .
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 9]: Cassandra moved her shoulders with an impatient shrug .
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 6]: `` I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 6]: I did n't mean that .
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 6]: But -- your husband ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 6]: `` Not one word . ''
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 9]: `` I thought you told him everything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 6]: `` About myself I do .
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 5]: Not about friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 14]: `` Thank you for that , at least , '' Cassandra said ungraciously .
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 15]: The next moment she threw out her hands with a gesture of hopeless appeal .
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 24]: `` Oh , Grizel , I 'll have to forgive you , for I need you so much , but it was hard !
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 21]: You need n't have grudged us that little time ... I could have killed you for coming in just then .
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 15]: As you know everything , tell me what we are to _ do _ ?
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 17]: ... I feel as if I were going mad ... What are we to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 7]: `` What does he suggest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 11]: `` He asked me to go away with him to-night .
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 14]: I 've told you , so now you can go and warn Bernard .
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 14]: Perhaps Providence will throw you up against him on the way home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 9]: Grizel mopped her eyes with the little handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 5]: `` Why sneer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 4]: she asked softly .
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 24]: `` It 's bad enough , goodness knows , without that to make it worse ... And are you going , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 11]: The voice was so tranquil that Cassandra started in surprise .
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 13]: `` What would you say , if I said I was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 15]: `` I think -- at this moment , I rather expect that you will !
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 13]: I should have said ` Yes ' myself at this point . ''
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 7]: `` Well , I did n't !
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 6]: I am stronger than you .
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 8]: I refused , because of the boy .
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 7]: But you need n't praise me .
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 5]: I deserve no praise .
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 18]: I 'm going to do my duty , but I 'm not doing it from my heart .
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 13]: I _ want to go _ , and I told him so .
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 9]: Did you know I was a bad woman ?
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 4]: I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 14]: I was rather proud of myself for being so unflirtatious all these years .
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 10]: It was only because I had not been tempted .
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 11]: The moment I am tempted , I go to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 14]: If we are judged by our thoughts , I 'm a wicked woman .
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 20]: I 'd give everything I possess in life , if I were free to go to him to-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 22]: `` So would I , so would I , -- if it had been Martin , '' cried Grizel , sobbing .
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 7]: `` Everything that belonged to myself .
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 26]: And it _ is n't _ wrong ; it is n't wicked ; it 's the human nature in us that we ca n't help .
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 14]: Every consideration for oneself goes down like ninepins before the one big thing .
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 18]: They do n't count ... It 's the _ other _ people who block the way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 8]: `` One other person in my case .
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 5]: Bernard does n't count .
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 6]: I am nothing to him .
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 17]: Why should I ruin my life by staying with a man who does n't want me ?
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 13]: If it were not for the boy , I 'd go to-night .
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 27]: You know what my married life has been , -- would you think I was doing wrong if I left the pretence to take the reality ?
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 17]: It would be a truer marriage , even if it were not blessed by the Church .
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 8]: Yet people would think we were wicked .
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 7]: Would you think so too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 3]: Grizel hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 9]: `` Sure I may speak straight out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 3]: Of course .
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 4]: I asked you .
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 16]: I 'm hurt so much already that you ca n't hurt me any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 21]: But for several minutes Grizel sat silently , her hands folded on her knee , her eyes steadily gazing ahead .
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 16]: And as she sat , gradually , surely , the expression of her face changed .
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 23]: The sparkle died out of her eyes and left them soft and grave , the curling lips took on a new tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 26]: It was as though she were deliberately banishing the things of this world , gathering to herself a strength to help in time of need .
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 18]: The little face grew tense with earnestness ; when she spoke her voice had a deepened note .
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 12]: `` Yes , dear , I think it would be wicked .
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 15]: Not so much for your own sake , as for all the people around .
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 12]: You know the inwardness of things , but they do n't .
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 22]: They would see only the bare , ugly fact ... ` Lady Cassandra has eloped with her husband 's friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 46]: It would be a bad breath stealing out , infecting wherever it went ; searching out weak places , and weakening them still more , -- If you three were alone on a desert island , I would n't hesitate a moment in your place .
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 37]: I should go to my mate , and there would be no sin on my soul , but we 're not in the desert , we 're in a crowd , and you , poor darling !
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 5]: are perched high up .
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 34]: You are a big person here in this little place ; down to the very school-children , everyone notices , everyone copies , everyone takes you as an example of what should be .
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 12]: And they have to keep the laws themselves , poor souls !
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 35]: whether they like them or not ... How do you think it would look to them if you , who have so much , threw over your duties , just to please yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 9]: Cassandra shook her head with a dreary indifference .
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 15]: `` But I do n't care , you see ; I do n't care .
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 13]: Nothing matters to me at this moment but just our two selves !
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 11]: It 's so easy for you to talk , Grizel .
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 10]: You are more than happy ; you are content !
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 10]: I 've never been content in all my life .
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 37]: I 've been starved of all that really matters in a woman 's life , and now , when I am offered a full meal , I must give it up and be hungrier than before !
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 46]: I am going to do what is right , for there is something in me which is stronger than passion , an inheritance , I suppose , from generations of stiff old Protestant ancestors , -- but the doing of it will break my heart .
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 11]: According to the old ideas it should make me happy .
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 11]: Oh , Grizel , Grizel , it is n't true !
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 12]: How can I be happy if I give up Dane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 5]: Grizel shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 5]: `` You ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 8]: Not for a long , long time .
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 14]: You 'll be miserable ... There 's only one thing , darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 10]: `` It would be worse if you did n't !
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 25]: You may be unhappy as Bernard 's wife , but you would be a hundred times more miserable as -- Dane 's mistress ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 4]: Cassandra flushed hotly .
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 7]: `` He would marry me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 7]: `` I 'm sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 4]: If he could .
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 8]: But -- '' `` Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 11]: why discuss it ; it is not going to happen .
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 35]: I 'm going to live on at the Court , and set an example to the school-children , and keep Bernard 's accounts ... and grow old , and die , and be buried .
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 40]: That is all I have to look forward to , and you have this to remember , Grizel Beverley , that it was _ you _ interrupted the one hour of perfect happiness that I have ever known ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 23]: `` I 'll stay away on Wednesday , '' Grizel said meekly , and they laughed together in feeble , halfhearted fashion .
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 57]: `` But I 'll come up later , and say everything all over again , '' she continued presently , `` and I 'll go _ on _ saying it , as often as you need it , and do my penance that way ... Take long views , Cassandra , darling , take long views !
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 58]: One is n't always young and ardent ; it 's only for a little spell , after all , and all the long , long time stretches ahead , when one has to be middle-aged , and elderly , and old ... Think how thankful you 'll be at forty , when the boy comes of age .
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 16]: Think how thankful you 'll be at fifty , when the grandchildren begin to appear .
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 32]: Think what a far-off tale it will seem at sixty , when you do n't want romance any more , but just to be quiet , and comfortable , and respected .
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 15]: And when you are seventy -- '' Cassandra stopped her with a hasty hand .
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 15]: `` I 'm not a bit interested in what I shall feel at seventy .
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 9]: I want to be happy _ now _ .
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 24]: I could say all these things to you , Grizel , if you were in my place , but they would n't help .
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 7]: I want to be loved ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 3]: Grizel sighed .
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 31]: She knew better than to advance the reality of her own affection at that moment , for the truest friendship on earth can never feel the gap left by love .
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 32]: There was only one person on earth who in any fashion could console Cassandra for Peignton 's loss , and he was the one for whom she was making her sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 28]: The glimpse she had had of Bernard junior during an exeat spent at home , was not inspiring , but Grizel 's indomitable optimism surmounted all difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 14]: `` The boy will love you , darling , '' she said softly .
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 5]: `` That will come !
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 19]: He is getting to the age when he will appreciate your beauty , and that means so much .
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 15]: He will begin by being proud of you , and the rest will follow .
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 10]: And he will mean more to you after this .
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 20]: When you have sacrificed so much for a person , he becomes more precious ... You 'll grow together .
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 8]: I know it , I feel it !
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 13]: In a few years ' time he will be your devoted companion .
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 26]: I 'm going to have a son like that myself some day , but I sha n't have the right to him that you have .
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 11]: I sha n't have paid such a big price ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 9]: The tears welled slowly into Cassandra 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 20]: She turned her head aside , and sat gazing into the mist of green which formed the outer world .
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 30]: A son 's love would be sweet , but it was at present merely a possibility , while Dane 's love was real , and near , and strong .
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 6]: And other women had both !
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 12]: Blessed women on whom husbands and sons waited with rival devotion .
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 48]: The bitter problem of inequality , old as the earth itself , tore at Cassandra 's heart , demanding why she should starve , while others sat at a feast ; why the narrow path should sometimes be strewn with flowers , and again with jagged stones .
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 24]: She fought it out in her mind while Grizel sat waiting , but to-day she had no power to find comfort for herself .
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 9]: Body and mind alike were spent and weary .
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 33]: She was thankful to feel the presence of a friend ... `` Are you one of the people , Grizel , who preach that all lots in life are equally good ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 6]: `` I should hope not .
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 7]: I have some common sense . ''
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 19]: `` Oh , it 's not a question of common sense ; it 's a question of faith .
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 7]: Mrs Evans would say they were .
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 30]: She says every heart knows its own bitterness , that people may appear very fortunate , but one can never tell that there is not a skeleton locked away .
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 75]: And if other people are terribly poor , or chronic invalids , or anything desperate like that , she says that they have a temperament that makes up , or that we can only see the present , and not life as a whole ... '' `` I 've known , -- by sight and hearsay , -- many whole lives , and they 've been a martyrdom , nearly all the way through .
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 16]: I 've known others , in the same way , which were nearly all sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 20]: Rainstorms , of course , and an occasional squall , but never , never the whirlwind or the lightning .
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 15]: Life is _ not _ evened out ; it 's folly to pretend it .
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 12]: It 's fifty times harder for some than for others . ''
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 4]: `` But why ?
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 6]: It does n't seem fair .
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 11]: It 's _ not _ always their own fault ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 5]: `` Of course not .
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 4]: That 's absurd .
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 10]: Some of the best people have the most trials .
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 25]: We 're bound to have our training , Cassandra , dear , and to go on being trained till we 've mastered our lessons .
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 30]: In that way we all fare alike , but some of us get most of it in this life , and so have the less to learn over there .
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 60]: Whatever happens to us after we die , we are not going to be metamorphosed in a moment into perfected saints ; we shall have to go on working our way up , and oh , Cassandra , would n't it be a discouraging feeling to be done with earth , and still drag about the same old sins ?
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 22]: How thankful we 'll be when we awake , for every struggle which had thrown off a bit of the load !
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 18]: That 's my explanation of life 's inequalities , and it has helped me more than anything .
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 39]: When the troubles came along , -- there were plenty of them , my dear , in the old days -- just as a detail I was in love with Martin for eight years before we were engaged !
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 31]: -- I used to say to myself : ` No use shirking ; if you do n't fight it out to-day , you 'll have to do it to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 9]: It will wait for you , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 11]: ... Set your teeth , and get it over . ''
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 8]: Cassandra looked at her with thoughtful eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 5]: `` Eight years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 9]: she repeated softly , `` eight years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 8]: and stared again , wistful and perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 16]: `` You are a continual joy to me , Grizel , and a continual surprise .
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 13]: -- I did n't know that you were a religious woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 10]: `` But I am , '' Grizel said nodding .
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 3]: `` Very !
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 5]: In my own way .
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 36]: The worst of it is , it is n't other people 's way , and they are always getting shocked at me , which is hard lines , for I 'm never shocked at them .
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 38]: I 've needed lots of help all those years , and I 've always found it , and I wish I could hand over my secrets to you ready made , but it would be no use .
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 32]: We 've got to worry them out for ourselves , and it takes time before the comfort begins to soak in ... '' `` I do n't want to learn lessons .
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 11]: I want to be happy , '' Cassandra repeated piteously .
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 28]: All the long lean years of her marriage added force to the yearning to take advantage of the long-deferred joy now that it was within her reach .
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 16]: `` And I want him to be happy too , but not -- with her !
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 16]: Grizel , did you know that she wishes to keep him to his engagement ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 3]: I know .
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 6]: She told me . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 6]: _ Told _ you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 9]: Cassandra 's voice took the old haughty ring .
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 17]: `` Then she discussed me with you also , and her altruistic efforts on my behalf !
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 13]: Dane is to remain engaged to her as a safeguard against myself .
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 9]: That 's the idea , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 7]: -- Life is a curious business .
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 17]: I never imagined that the time would come when Teresa Mallison would dictate to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 4]: Grizel smiled mischievously .
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 14]: `` And does n't it rouse the devil in you when she does !
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 3]: Never mind !
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 7]: I 'm pleased to see it .
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 9]: It 's a healthy sign under the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 30]: You 'll need a good supply of that pride to see you through the next month , and I guess there 's no fear of its running out . ''
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 13]: Then her face sobered , and her voice took a serious tone .
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 3]: `` Cassandra !
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 9]: you must try to be fair to Teresa .
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 28]: She 's young and crude , and opinionated , but this has been a great big test , and she 's been rather -- _ fine _ .
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 14]: I never admired anything more than her composure that day on the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 9]: It was n't because she did n't feel .
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 20]: The slight must have been all the worse , just because she is so complacent and sure of herself .
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 9]: She went through torture with her lips shut .
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 56]: She 's even more to be pitied than you , Cassandra , for she _ was _ happy , and she believed so firmly that she was going to be happy ever after , and now -- at the best -- it can never be the same -- '' Cassandra interposed with a sharp-cut question .
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 12]: `` What do you mean by ` the best ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 23]: `` From her point of view , -- that he should eventually marry her , and make the best of what remains .
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 33]: It 's pretty hard on a girl of twenty-four to know that her lover has to nerve himself up to take her like a disagreeable tonic which may eventually do him good .
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 21]: I could not have stood it ; I 'm quite sure _ you _ could n't , but Teresa can .
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 25]: The bull-dog quality in her wo n't let go ; she can sit tight and wait , and it 's the waiters who win .
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 28]: She will go through a bad time , but in the end -- '' Grizel met Cassandra 's flashing eyes , and said gently , `` Dear !
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 52]: if you had the choice , would n't you rather think of him in the future with a home and children , happy again , if not just in the same way , rather than as a lonely man , eating his heart out for what he could n't have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 4]: cried Cassandra defiantly .
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 6]: I want him to remember .
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 8]: I _ want _ him to think .
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 53]: I 'd rather anything happened than that he should forget ... '' Then Grizel laughed , a soft , tender little laugh , and looking back on that scene in the days which followed , Cassandra knew that more than for any words of comfort , she was grateful for that laugh .
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 49]: There was in it the tenderness which a nurse bestows upon the railings of pain-racked sufferers , and with it a beautiful incredulity which refused to believe mere words , and set her faith on the force within , content to wait until it should resume the mastery .
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 16]: The task of a comforter is only less difficult than that of the sufferer himself .
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 17]: He has need of infinite tenderness , infinite tolerance , above all , of infinite patience .
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 58]: Not in one hour , or one week , or one month will his solace work its effect ; again and again must he open his heart , and pour forth all that is his of wisdom , and strength and inspiration , only to find himself thrown back to the very position from which he started .
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 6]: `` Oh , Grizel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 4]: cried Cassandra sharply .
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 6]: `` Why did you come ?
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 6]: Why did you interrupt us ?
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 9]: And oh , what are we to do ?
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 6]: What shall we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 3]: THE SUMMONS .
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 14]: Cassandra returned home to fight her battle hour after hour with weary reiteration .
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 44]: In her mind was one predominating determination , -- to be loyal to the son she had borne , and to bring no shame upon his name , but against the cold rock of that decision dashed the waves of a passionate desire .
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 20]: She was starving for love , and the gates of her woman 's kingdom stood open entreating her entrance .
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 29]: All that she had longed for , all that she had dreamt , was waiting for her ; the lifting of a hand would bring it to pass .
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 22]: Duty faced passion in grim stolidity ; passion lashed itself in fury , only to fall abashed before that impenetrable front .
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 43]: Cassandra had sufficient strength to hold fast to her determination ; sufficient weakness to regret its power , and to long , wildly , weakly , overwhelmingly for courage to throw everything to the winds , and snatch her hour of joy .
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 31]: Grizel had prophesied that the joy would be but of an hour , that continued happiness was impossible under wrong conditions , and in her heart Cassandra acknowledged the truth .
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 34]: Both Dane and herself had lived their lives in an atmosphere of convention and morality ; they were not the stuff to defy the world , and live undaunted by snubs and chills .
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 14]: The first wild rapture would be succeeded by mutual loneliness , mutual remorse .
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 15]: On each would press a burden of responsibility for that other dear wrecked life .
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 43]: Cassandra acknowledged the inevitability of regret , in imagination lived through it , saw the cloud on Dane 's face , felt the cramp at her own heart , but even so ... even so ... they would have had their hour !
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 15]: If the ship were sunk , there would be treasure saved from the wreck .
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 31]: Better to sail forth for the high seas , facing dauntlessly tempest and fire , than to spend the whole of life in a backwater , anchored to a stone !
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 12]: So the battle waged , hour after hour in weary repetition .
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 19]: Cassandra fought vainly to sink the woman in the mother , and resurrect the old thrills of devotion .
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 66]: She thought of the baby who had lain in her arms , the little cooing , kicking cherub who had been the light of her eyes ; she thought of the first toddling steps , of the first coherent word , of the first , the very first time that the little arms stretched out , of the little dimpled baby splashing in a bath .
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 68]: One by one she recalled the landmarks sweet to a mother 's heart , but before them all , veiling them like a cloud , stood the image of a stolid , freckled-face boy in an Eton suit , a boy who signed his letters `` Raynor , '' considered affection bad form , and preferred to spend the `` hols '' visiting other fellows ' homes .
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 25]: It was not for the adorable baby of old , but for the Eton-suited boy of to-day that she was to sacrifice her love !
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 4]: Would he care ?
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 5]: Would he really care ?
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 12]: Guiltily she allowed her mind to wander down the forbidden path .
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 5]: He would hear nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 11]: Bernard would keep everything from him until -- the divorce .
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 33]: The case would be undefended , no savoury morsels would appear in the newspaper to whet the appetites of the unclean , the vast majority of readers would not notice its presence .
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 12]: Eventually , of course , something would have to be said .
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 26]: Cassandra winced as she imagined Bernard 's bluff words to his son : `` Look here , boy , never speak of your mother again .
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 6]: She 's not coming back .
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 20]: Some day you 'll understand ; until then do as you 're told , and keep your mouth shut .
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 4]: She 's dead .
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 4]: D'you understand that ?
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 9]: Dead and buried so far as concerns us .
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 7]: Never speak of her again . ''
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 41]: Bernard would not abuse a mother to her son , his sense of fair play was too strong ; he would simply shut her out from his life , and leave the boy to form his own judgment later on .
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 37]: But with the sharpness of dawning adolescence Bernard junior would sense something wrong , something shameful , flush unhappily beneath the servants ' gaze , and return to school miserably dreading that the fellows had heard !
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 6]: Cassandra could not do it .
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 7]: She could not shame her child .
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 20]: She could not step down from the pedestal on which the most prosaic of sons instinctively places a mother .
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 19]: Every fresh struggle ended in the same most piteous , most womanly cry : `` I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 4]: I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 14]: But oh , Dane , Dane , I _ want to _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 31]: During these three days Cassandra stayed entirely within the grounds and denied herself to visitors , but she had a constant terror that Teresa would call and force an interview .
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 26]: The girl must suspect some such meeting as had taken place in the summer-house ; must realise that her own fate hung in the balance .
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 14]: What more natural than that she should want to plead her own cause ?
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 5]: Cassandra stiffened in anticipation .
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 23]: Nothing , she knew , would induce such a reckless disregard of duty as to hear it advocated from Teresa 's lips .
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 18]: For Heaven 's sake , for her _ own _ sake , let the girl keep away !
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 22]: But the days slipped past , and Teresa did not appear , and a new terror dawned in Cassandra 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 23]: Suppose instead of coming to herself , the girl went to Bernard and warned him of the threatened danger to his house !
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 38]: Every time that her husband entered the room afresh , Cassandra glanced at his face with an eager scrutiny , and every time Bernard smiled with unruffled cheerfulness and said , `` Feeling better , old girl ?
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 5]: Had your tonic ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 60]: Grizel had laid down strict injunctions as to the treatment of her patient on her return to the Court , and had perjured herself by giving the Squire a highly pessimistic opinion of his wife 's health , the result of which had been a certain amount of bluff kindliness and unfailing enquiries as to the consumption of tonics .
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 48]: Cassandra detested the idea of Bernard 's hearing the truth from Teresa 's lips , but there were occasions when she burned to tell him herself , occasions when it would have been the greatest relief in the world to say , `` I am not ill .
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 7]: I am not suffering from shock .
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 5]: I am in love .
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 10]: I want to elope with your friend Dane Peignton .
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 14]: I am breaking my heart because it 's my duty to stay . ''
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 10]: Imagination pictured his face as he stood and listened .
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 34]: The steely eyes , the glint of teeth , the ruddy colour surging up over the thick throat , the large clean-shaven face , up to the roots of the short sandy hair .
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 25]: `` You can look me in the face , '' he would say , `` and _ dare _ to say such a thing ?
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 6]: Have you no shame ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 8]: `` Why should I have shame ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 6]: she could hear herself answer .
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 7]: `` I have done no wrong .
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 11]: I am breaking my heart to do what is right .
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 14]: I am not ashamed , but I am dreadfully , dreadfully unhappy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 7]: But Bernard would have no compassion .
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 6]: He would make no distinctions .
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 9]: She would henceforth be contemptible in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 27]: To the end of their life together he would regard her with suspicion ; enquiring into her every action , reading guilt into the simplest friendship .
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 10]: The horror of that suspicion sealed Cassandra 's lips .
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 14]: The days passed by , Wednesday arrived , and Teresa had not moved .
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 6]: Cassandra vouchsafed a grudging admiration .
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 16]: There was -- as Grizel had said -- something fine about the girl 's restraint .
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 31]: What was she thinking , what was she doing all these days , when of a certainty Dane must be standing aloof , waiting for the message which never came ?
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 20]: How could she bear it , caged in that tiny house , with the terrible mother probing for explanations ?
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 21]: Cassandra recalled how Mary had declared that it was impossible even to cry without attracting curious rappings at the door .
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 12]: She heaved a sigh of thankfulness for the blessing of space .
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 29]: Wednesday morning passed by , lunch hour came bringing with it Bernard , and the inevitable enquiry _ re _ tonics , two o'clock arrived , three o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 34]: In another half-hour she would leave the house , take her way to the summer-house , meet Dane once more , look deep into his eyes , feel the clasp of his arms .
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 40]: All life seemed concentrated into those next few hours , the expectation had been in her heart since the moment when she had parted from him four days before ; the near prospect of meeting had mitigated every pang .
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 15]: Now that that meeting was at hand every other feeling was merged in joy .
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 16]: The moment was hers , she seized it greedily , with no consciousness of guilt .
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 26]: She was going to do right , she was going to say goodbye , -- surely even Teresa would not grudge her her short hour !
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 29]: Cassandra put on a shady hat , and stood before the long mirror regarding her own reflection as a woman will who is about to meet her lover .
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 59]: The white dress fell in soft lines accentuating her long slimness , the hat was white also , a simple affair of straw , with a twisted scarf of _ crepe _ , the gold-flecked hair , the soft carmine of the cheeks , the blue , pathetic eyes gained an added beauty from the lack of colour .
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 34]: Cassandra knew that she was beautiful at that moment , she also knew that that beauty would plant a sharper thorn in Dane 's heart , but being a woman she rejoiced nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 19]: If she could have made herself more lovely , she would have done it unto ten times ten .
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 18]: She turned from the mirror , opened the door of her room , and crept quietly downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 19]: It was her desire that no one should see her or know that she had left the house .
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 46]: Once the great hall was reached she would slip into the library , and thence through the open window to a side path giving access to a shrubbery , thereby avoiding observation from upstair windows or from the gardeners at work on the terrace beds .
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 14]: Then let what might happen , she would be undisturbed for the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 22]: She had reached the lowest step , the library was but a few yards away , when fate shot her bolt .
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 18]: The door of Bernard 's office opened , and he came towards her , telegram in hand .
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 7]: Many telegrams arrived at the Court .
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 41]: Cassandra was too much a woman of the world to share the fear with which many of her sisters regard the orange-coloured sheets , but she needed no words to tell her that this message was no mere business communication .
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 10]: At the mere sight her heart died within her .
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 25]: There was just one thing on earth which she lived for at that moment , and the telegram had come to block her way .
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 10]: She stood still and cold waiting Bernard 's explanation .
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 13]: `` Look here , I say , -- here 's bad news !
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 4]: The old Mater .
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 5]: Taken worse this morning .
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 3]: Another stroke .
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 12]: The second this time , so it may mean the end .
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 9]: Jevons has been looking up the trains . ''
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 5]: Cassandra did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 32]: The old Mater was a venerable and disagreeable old lady whose bronchitic tendencies had made it necessary to abandon the dower house and make her abode in a more southern county .
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 21]: The necessity had been to the daughter-in-law a matter of continual thanksgiving , but to the Squire a real regret .
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 38]: His intensely conventional nature recognised the duty of honouring a parent , and he had a genuine and rather touching affection for the cross old woman , who rarely opened her mouth except to grumble and lament .
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 29]: To Cassandra the mother-in-law had been an unmitigated trial , and she could not affect to feel regret at the prospect of an end to a weary invalidism .
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 16]: The knife-like pang which rent her heart had no connection with the house of Raynor .
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 11]: `` You -- you are going down at once ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7017 len. 6]: `` What do you think !
Parsing [sent. 7018 len. 6]: Of course we 're going .
Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 13]: I was just coming up to tell you to get ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 9]: The pang of presentiment had been well founded .
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 18]: Cassandra felt the hopelessness of a trapped animal , but desperation nerved her to a feeble protest .
Parsing [sent. 7022 len. 3]: `` Me ?
Parsing [sent. 7023 len. 2]: Bernard !
Parsing [sent. 7024 len. 7]: _ ought _ I to come ?
Parsing [sent. 7025 len. 5]: She 'll be unconscious .
Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 8]: I could n't _ do _ anything .
Parsing [sent. 7027 len. 15]: I should only be another person in the house -- giving more trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 7028 len. 14]: The blue eyes had their most steely glance as he turned upon her .
Parsing [sent. 7029 len. 9]: `` More shame to you if you did !
Parsing [sent. 7030 len. 9]: You can nurse her , ca n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 7031 len. 7]: Take your turn with the maid ?
Parsing [sent. 7032 len. 8]: She has a prejudice against hired nurses .
Parsing [sent. 7033 len. 8]: Good heavens , have you no feeling ?
Parsing [sent. 7034 len. 14]: My mother ill -- dying -- and you talk of staying at home !
Parsing [sent. 7035 len. 9]: What 's the matter if she is unconscious ?
Parsing [sent. 7036 len. 20]: Your duty is to go and look after her , and I 'll see that you do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7037 len. 11]: He pulled out his watch and looked at it hastily .
Parsing [sent. 7038 len. 11]: `` You have twenty-five minutes before the car comes round .
Parsing [sent. 7039 len. 18]: Get Rogers to put a few things in a bag -- just what you want for to-night .
Parsing [sent. 7040 len. 8]: She can bring along the boxes to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 7041 len. 27]: Goodness knows how long we may have to stay ... '' He wheeled round and went back to his room , and Cassandra dragged wearily upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 7042 len. 73]: Twenty-five minutes -- in twenty-five minutes ' time Dane would be awaiting her in the summer-house , and she herself would be leaving the house , leaving the neighbourhood , travelling down to the wilds of Devon , there to remain for goodness knew how long , out of sight , out of touch , -- a prisoner , when of all times in her life she most longed to be free .
Parsing [sent. 7043 len. 27]: Wild impulses flocked into her mind , an impulse to turn back , make her escape into the shrubbery , and fly to keep her tryst .
Parsing [sent. 7044 len. 43]: If Dane were waiting , would it be possible to reach him , to explain , feel for one moment the grip of his arms , and get back in time to change her dress , and be ready for the car ?
Parsing [sent. 7045 len. 6]: No , it was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 7046 len. 10]: Moreover , what if Dane had not yet arrived ?
Parsing [sent. 7047 len. 28]: When she had gone so far , would she have courage to drag herself from the spot , where at any moment she might behold him approaching ?
Parsing [sent. 7048 len. 57]: She knew she had not , and for one wild moment wondered if she could dare still further ; deliberately disappear , deliberately _ stay _ away until Bernard was forced to depart alone , but even while one by one the questions raced through her brain she continued to drag wearily up the great staircase .
Parsing [sent. 7049 len. 13]: Here was an illustration of the greater struggle on a lesser plane .
Parsing [sent. 7050 len. 16]: Her heart was vagrant , panting to escape , but the chains of duty held .
Parsing [sent. 7051 len. 26]: Bernard was her husband ; he was in trouble ; he demanded her help ; at whatever cost to herself that help must be given .
Parsing [sent. 7052 len. 30]: Cassandra gave instructions to her maid , and retired to her boudoir to send a telephone message to the one person in Chumley who would come to her aid .
Parsing [sent. 7053 len. 16]: Grizel was at home , and her voice came over the wire clear and distinct .
Parsing [sent. 7054 len. 7]: `` Yes , it 's me .
Parsing [sent. 7055 len. 4]: I 'm alone .
Parsing [sent. 7056 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7057 len. 6]: Cassandra 's words came haltingly .
Parsing [sent. 7058 len. 10]: Her proud spirit had difficulty in framing that message .
Parsing [sent. 7059 len. 8]: `` This is Wednesday ... Wednesday afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 7060 len. 10]: You remember what was to happen on Wednesday afternoon ?
Parsing [sent. 7061 len. 17]: ... Bernard has just had a wire to say that his mother has had a stroke .
Parsing [sent. 7062 len. 13]: He is going to her at once -- we are both going .
Parsing [sent. 7063 len. 23]: He says I am to nurse her ... We leave in -- er -- in a quarter of an hour ... Grizel !
Parsing [sent. 7064 len. 3]: I. . .
Parsing [sent. 7065 len. 16]: I was just starting for the summer-house , when he met me with this news .
Parsing [sent. 7066 len. 15]: There is no time for -- anything ... Will _ you _ explain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7067 len. 9]: Grizel 's voice came back in instant reassurement .
Parsing [sent. 7068 len. 6]: `` Cassandra , I will !
Parsing [sent. 7069 len. 20]: Leave it to me ... Cassandra , darling , _ how _ long are you to be away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7070 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 7071 len. 4]: How should I ?
Parsing [sent. 7072 len. 4]: Goodness knows ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7073 len. 4]: cried Cassandra bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 7074 len. 21]: Like a faint , sweet echo came back the words in Grizel 's deepest tones : `` Goodness knows ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7075 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 7076 len. 2]: FAREWELL !
Parsing [sent. 7077 len. 7]: The old Mater was not unconscious .
Parsing [sent. 7078 len. 34]: The mysterious physical lightning had smitten the left side of the body , left a drawn , disfigured face , and a helpless arm and leg , but the spirit within was untouched .
Parsing [sent. 7079 len. 27]: By the time that her son arrived , the old Mater had realised what had happened to her , and was seething with bitterness and rebellion .
Parsing [sent. 7080 len. 34]: It was a terrible sight to see the blaze of the living eye in the dead face ; a piteous thing to listen to the mumbled words which proceeded from the twisted lips .
Parsing [sent. 7081 len. 47]: The tears came into the Squire 's eyes as he stood by his mother 's bed , he knelt on the floor beside her , and stroked her brow with his big sunburnt hand ; with extraordinary sharpness he divined the meaning of her muffled speech .
Parsing [sent. 7082 len. 30]: Throughout that evening , and for hours at a time throughout the days which followed , he sat by her bedside , ministering to her wants with clumsy eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 7083 len. 40]: Cassandra was for the time being too intensely absorbed with the tragedy of her own life to feel any active interest in what was passing before her eyes , but subconsciously the various pictures photographed themselves on her mind .
Parsing [sent. 7084 len. 61]: Bernard smiling , indifferent to snubs , persuading his mother to eat , to swallow her medicine ; Bernard , suppressing yawns , sitting up to the small hours to be `` at hand '' ; Bernard holding the cold hand between his own warm palms , and by force of his strong electric current soothing the patient to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 7085 len. 24]: He was not _ trying _ to be patient ; he _ was _ patient , out of pure loving kindness and compassion .
Parsing [sent. 7086 len. 33]: Slowly , gradually , the knowledge penetrated into Cassandra 's brain , and she asked herself sadly wherein she had failed , that this quality of tenderness was so lacking towards herself !
Parsing [sent. 7087 len. 32]: For some months after their marriage Bernard had been the most ardent of lovers , then passion waned , and with no appreciable second stage , neglect had taken its place .
Parsing [sent. 7088 len. 30]: She had been bitterly surprised , bitterly wounded , but what had she done to recapture her husband 's love , and turn it into a more enduring form ?
Parsing [sent. 7089 len. 37]: Had she once realised , as Grizel Beverley had realised in the midst of her bridal joy , that love is a tender plant , which can only preserve its fragrance when tended with unremitting care ?
Parsing [sent. 7090 len. 32]: Cassandra looked back and saw herself retiring into a chilly reserve , meeting neglect with neglect , indifference with indifference , disdaining to invite a love which was not voluntarily bestowed .
Parsing [sent. 7091 len. 58]: It had seemed , at the time , the only way of preserving her dignity , but as she watched her husband by his mother 's bedside , there came a sudden realisation that if she had thought less of pride , and more of love , the barrenness of their joint lives might have been averted .
Parsing [sent. 7092 len. 109]: If she had used her woman 's wiles , -- smiled , cajoled , even in those early days , wept a few , -- just a few , pretty , becoming tears , to enforce her need , the barrier would never have grown so high : Cassandra had been accustomed to put all the blame on her husband 's shoulders , and to congratulate herself on being immaculately free from blame ; never till this moment had she realised that to a man of the Squire 's temperament , her attitude of chill detachment , and smiling indifference , was of all things the most exasperating .
Parsing [sent. 7093 len. 36]: If she had blazed in anger , even to the extent of facing an occasional battle royal , the corroding bitterness would have found a vent , and reconciliation opened the way to fresh tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 7094 len. 11]: `` It 's my fault as much as his ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7095 len. 10]: Cassandra acknowledged , and the admission softened her heart .
Parsing [sent. 7096 len. 7]: The old Mater did not die .
Parsing [sent. 7097 len. 14]: The critical days dragged slowly past , and she grimly held her own .
Parsing [sent. 7098 len. 23]: In all human probability she would live on for months , for years , until the lightning fell for the third time .
Parsing [sent. 7099 len. 29]: To Cassandra such a recovery seemed a piteous thing , but the Squire 's rejoicings were whole-hearted , and the old Mater herself wore an air of triumph .
Parsing [sent. 7100 len. 39]: Apparently life was dear to her still , and the prospect of lying in bed , with one half of her body already dead , held more attractions than the celestial choirs on which she pinned her faith .
Parsing [sent. 7101 len. 28]: There was a grim irony in hearing the twisted lips murmur fragments of her favourite hymn -- `` Oh , Lamb of God , I come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7102 len. 21]: and Cassandra 's sense of humour could not resist the reflection that the old lady was exceedingly loath to go !
Parsing [sent. 7103 len. 76]: Grizel wrote that she had given Dane the necessary explanation , and after four days ' incessant consideration , Cassandra wrote and despatched the following letter : `` I was coming to you , as I promised ; I had counted every moment of every day as it passed , longing for the time to arrive ; in another minute I should have been on my way , and then , -- what was it ?
Parsing [sent. 7104 len. 9]: -- fate , chance , providence , God ?
Parsing [sent. 7105 len. 21]: -- _ Something _ intervened , and it became impossible for me to meet you , then , or later .
Parsing [sent. 7106 len. 11]: I do n't know how long we shall be here .
Parsing [sent. 7107 len. 18]: My husband 's mother is recovering , but she can not bear him out of her sight .
Parsing [sent. 7108 len. 27]: He is an angel of goodness to her , and in some wonderful way seems to be able to lend her some of his own strength .
Parsing [sent. 7109 len. 44]: We may be here for months ; it will certainly be many weeks ; so I ca n't come , Dane , I ca n't have the one joy I longed for ... the one more hour together , before we said good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 7110 len. 8]: `` It may be for the best .
Parsing [sent. 7111 len. 20]: I may look back in years to come , and be thankful , but I 'm not thankful now .
Parsing [sent. 7112 len. 29]: It seems hard , and cruel , and unjust , that I could not have that little hour , and it made it harder , being so near .
Parsing [sent. 7113 len. 7]: Oh , Dane , that journey !
Parsing [sent. 7114 len. 29]: Can you for a moment imagine how desperately , achingly miserable I was , steaming farther and farther away with every moment ; thinking of you sitting waiting !
Parsing [sent. 7115 len. 6]: I wonder what you thought .
Parsing [sent. 7116 len. 7]: -- I wonder what you feared ?
Parsing [sent. 7117 len. 21]: But you must have been sure of one thing , at least , -- that my heart was with you !
Parsing [sent. 7118 len. 3]: `` Dane !
Parsing [sent. 7119 len. 13]: I want you to burn this letter after you have read it .
Parsing [sent. 7120 len. 26]: I must tell you all that is in my heart , but it is best for both of us that it should not be preserved .
Parsing [sent. 7121 len. 21]: I was going to say , that you should forget it , but I know that will not be possible .
Parsing [sent. 7122 len. 26]: `` I am going to stay at my post , Dane , and try to make more of it than I 've done till now .
Parsing [sent. 7123 len. 21]: I told you that in making my decision I had no consideration for Bernard , but that was a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 7124 len. 16]: I _ must _ consider him , for he is the principal person in life .
Parsing [sent. 7125 len. 24]: He does not love me , but since coming here , I have begun to see that that is partly my own fault .
Parsing [sent. 7126 len. 24]: I was very young when we married , and I took it for granted that he would remain for ever an adoring lover .
Parsing [sent. 7127 len. 12]: When he grew cool and careless -- it was humiliatingly soon !
Parsing [sent. 7128 len. 22]: -- my miserable pride made me treat him as indifferently as he treated me , and so we have grown apart .
Parsing [sent. 7129 len. 28]: I thought he was incapable of tenderness , but watching him with his mother , I wonder if it is simply that I have shown no need .
Parsing [sent. 7130 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7131 len. 63]: I 've made a failure of it all -- with the boy too , it seems , though I _ did _ love him ; I did pour out my love ... What is wrong with me , that the people who should love me _ do n't _ , and when someone comes along who does , we must be parted ?
Parsing [sent. 7132 len. 12]: `` Did you think I should come to you that night ?
Parsing [sent. 7133 len. 18]: Now that it is past and over , I can tell you that I very nearly did !
Parsing [sent. 7134 len. 42]: An impulse came over me about nine o'clock , so overwhelmingly strong , that it was all I could do not to rush out , as I was , and make my way to you , bareheaded , across the park .
Parsing [sent. 7135 len. 10]: The effort to resist left me cold and faint .
Parsing [sent. 7136 len. 15]: -- I wondered if you were thinking of me , willing me to come !
Parsing [sent. 7137 len. 42]: And once again , though never quite so violently , the impulse returned , but each time I resisted , and the end finds me here , tied in a sick room , doing my duty , and bidding you goodbye .
Parsing [sent. 7138 len. 11]: `` It 's hopeless , Dane ; it 's hopeless !
Parsing [sent. 7139 len. 6]: There is too much between .
Parsing [sent. 7140 len. 17]: You must banish me from your life , and make the most of what is left .
Parsing [sent. 7141 len. 35]: Is n't it strange how in one of our first real talks we discussed makeshifts , and I asked you if you could manage to be happy , if you were denied the best .
Parsing [sent. 7142 len. 17]: You answered so certainly ; seemed to think it so poor-spirited to waste life in regrets .
Parsing [sent. 7143 len. 15]: My poor Dane , now you will have to turn your words into deeds !
Parsing [sent. 7144 len. 15]: `` By the time we return home , you will probably have left Chumley .
Parsing [sent. 7145 len. 10]: I can feel that it would be better so .
Parsing [sent. 7146 len. 35]: The agony of knowing that you were near , not seeing you , or seeing you only in public , would be more than I could bear , and -- there is your engagement !
Parsing [sent. 7147 len. 25]: I ca n't write of that , or of her -- but surely for a time at least , you would be better apart !
Parsing [sent. 7148 len. 13]: And we must school ourselves , Dane -- we must get accustomed .
Parsing [sent. 7149 len. 39]: `` Oh , beloved , just once , before it is good-bye , I thank you for loving me , -- I thank you for all you have given , I thank you for all you have received .
Parsing [sent. 7150 len. 19]: It was only for a little time , but you _ did _ open the gates of Eden !
Parsing [sent. 7151 len. 18]: we _ did _ walk in Paradise ; we did taste and know the perfection of content !
Parsing [sent. 7152 len. 44]: It was all beautiful , all clean , all white , and because it ca n't live on and keep its beauty , we 'll bury it , Dane , deep in our hearts , and live on as bravely as we may !
Parsing [sent. 7153 len. 4]: `` Cassandra . ''
Parsing [sent. 7154 len. 12]: Dane 's reply came by return of post : `` Beloved !
Parsing [sent. 7155 len. 11]: Mrs Beverley sent for me and gave me your message .
Parsing [sent. 7156 len. 12]: I have been to see her every day since you left .
Parsing [sent. 7157 len. 12]: I do n't know how I should have existed without her .
Parsing [sent. 7158 len. 7]: Every day has seemed a year .
Parsing [sent. 7159 len. 22]: I made sure you would write ; I knew you _ must _ write , but it was a long waiting .
Parsing [sent. 7160 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 7161 len. 10]: I willed you to come to me that night .
Parsing [sent. 7162 len. 7]: I nearly succeeded , it appears .
Parsing [sent. 7163 len. 11]: God forgive me , I wish it had been quite !
Parsing [sent. 7164 len. 30]: Every hour of those long days I hoped against hope for a summons from you , and then at last Wednesday came , and I made sure of meeting .
Parsing [sent. 7165 len. 27]: -- I nearly went mad , sitting in that summer-house , realising that you were not coming , imagining all kinds of wild , impossible things .
Parsing [sent. 7166 len. 16]: It was balm to know that at least you had _ wanted _ to come .
Parsing [sent. 7167 len. 14]: `` God bless you , my beautiful , for your sweet , words !
Parsing [sent. 7168 len. 12]: My love for you has been the glory of my life .
Parsing [sent. 7169 len. 23]: From the first moment that we met , you have been my Queen , and I your servant , waiting to obey .
Parsing [sent. 7170 len. 6]: I will obey you now .
Parsing [sent. 7171 len. 23]: Since it will be easier for you if I am at a distance , I will arrange to leave Chumley at once .
Parsing [sent. 7172 len. 5]: Things fit in easily .
Parsing [sent. 7173 len. 23]: I dropped Paley a hint that I was unsettled , and he sends me the kindest invitation to join him in Italy .
Parsing [sent. 7174 len. 25]: I shall go there , I think , for the next few months , and your wonderful Grizel is already planning for the future .
Parsing [sent. 7175 len. 44]: There are a number of wealthy relations , so to speak , at her feet , having come into their wealth through her disinterestedness in marrying Beverley , and amongst them such a thing as a small land agency should be easily obtained .
Parsing [sent. 7176 len. 5]: `` We 'll see !
Parsing [sent. 7177 len. 19]: I ca n't think about the future at present , or anything but just -- _ thee _ !
Parsing [sent. 7178 len. 19]: There is much in your letter that I ca n't answer ; dare n't trust myself to answer .
Parsing [sent. 7179 len. 7]: How could a man grow cold ?
Parsing [sent. 7180 len. 12]: But it is not for me to make things more difficult .
Parsing [sent. 7181 len. 22]: When I realise how little I have to offer and how much you stand to lose , my lips are sealed .
Parsing [sent. 7182 len. 14]: There could be no happiness for me , if I ruined your life .
Parsing [sent. 7183 len. 8]: `` Mrs Beverley has done me good .
Parsing [sent. 7184 len. 20]: I was a madman when I went to her , but she has calmed me into my right mind .
Parsing [sent. 7185 len. 3]: She understands .
Parsing [sent. 7186 len. 14]: I retract all I have ever said in disparagement of ` Grizel . '
Parsing [sent. 7187 len. 12]: But I was jealous of her happiness , seeing You sad .
Parsing [sent. 7188 len. 13]: `` One word I must add ... My engagement will formally continue .
Parsing [sent. 7189 len. 5]: I have explained everything .
Parsing [sent. 7190 len. 34]: She knows that at any time a word from you would bring me to your side ; but she still wishes me to take no public step , until a year has passed .
Parsing [sent. 7191 len. 32]: If I were to remain in Chumley the thing would be impossible , but at a distance , -- as it makes things easier for her , I can hardly refuse .
Parsing [sent. 7192 len. 12]: She is very generous to me , Cassandra ; very sweet .
Parsing [sent. 7193 len. 10]: I wish I could love her as she deserves .
Parsing [sent. 7194 len. 31]: For her sake , and yours , I am torn with regret ; for my own , even now in the first smart of the wound , I have none .
Parsing [sent. 7195 len. 11]: When I philosophised so lightly , I spoke without experience .
Parsing [sent. 7196 len. 7]: I had never known the best .
Parsing [sent. 7197 len. 13]: Now I do know , and the knowledge is worth its price .
Parsing [sent. 7198 len. 21]: Our own door is barred , Cassandra , but we have a key in our hands which opens many doors !
Parsing [sent. 7199 len. 4]: `` Dane . ''
Parsing [sent. 7200 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY NINE .
Parsing [sent. 7201 len. 9]: MAJOR MALLISON , OR THE DART OF DEATH .
Parsing [sent. 7202 len. 36]: It was a spring morning , a year from the day when Mary Mallison had left home , and the remaining three members of the family at the Cottage were seated round the breakfast table .
Parsing [sent. 7203 len. 47]: The passage of a single year leaves little impression in the appearance of grown men and women , but this instance was the exception to the rule , for an observant eye would have noted in each countenance something that had been missing twelve months before .
Parsing [sent. 7204 len. 12]: The Major had aged , in spirit as well as body .
Parsing [sent. 7205 len. 25]: He ate little , but moved his lips continually in nerve-racked fashion , his faded eyes wandered here and there with a pitiful unrest .
Parsing [sent. 7206 len. 29]: Mrs Mallison had noted the symptoms and ordered cod-liver oil , and the Major swallowed the doses with resignation , feeling the cure less obnoxious than continuous argument .
Parsing [sent. 7207 len. 16]: A large bottle of the oil stood in readiness on a table near the door .
Parsing [sent. 7208 len. 16]: Mrs Mallison was stout and bustling as ever , but had lost her erstwhile complacency .
Parsing [sent. 7209 len. 30]: In truth , though the good lady kept up a valiant presence in public , she was little pleased with the way things were going with her two daughters .
Parsing [sent. 7210 len. 34]: A year ago both had been on the wave of prosperity , but the wave had floated them into a backwater , rather than to the haven where she would have them be .
Parsing [sent. 7211 len. 16]: Mary was still wandering about the Continent , and mentioning no date for her return .
Parsing [sent. 7212 len. 28]: After several months in Switzerland she had crossed the frontier into Italy , had visited Rome and Florence and Venice , and was now domiciled in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 7213 len. 14]: She wrote regularly once a fortnight , but her letters were extraordinarily unenlightening .
Parsing [sent. 7214 len. 21]: Travellers ' letters are as a rule boring in their minutiae , but Mary never attempted a word of description .
Parsing [sent. 7215 len. 40]: She simply gave a list of the things she had seen , with an occasional addition of `` it was very beautiful , '' which fact , as Mrs Mallison tartly remarked , her readers knew without being told .
Parsing [sent. 7216 len. 11]: She sent home no presents as mementoes to the stay-at-homes .
Parsing [sent. 7217 len. 14]: As a rich , independent daughter Mary could not be considered a success .
Parsing [sent. 7218 len. 6]: Teresa 's marriage hung fire !
Parsing [sent. 7219 len. 34]: Mrs Mallison was a talkative woman , and it was to her credit that even to her husband she had not allowed her growing distrust of Dane Peignton to find vent in words .
Parsing [sent. 7220 len. 11]: But day after day she asked herself the same question .
Parsing [sent. 7221 len. 27]: Since the man cared enough for Teresa to ask her to be his wife , why did he not show a natural desire to be married ?
Parsing [sent. 7222 len. 24]: It was no question of means , for the new agency was sufficiently good , and included the use of a delightful house .
Parsing [sent. 7223 len. 62]: It could be no question of health , since he had not been laid up a day the whole winter , and if , as was represented , his responsibility was such that he could not spare even a week at Christmas to visit Chumley , all the more reason that he should have a wife to look after his home !
Parsing [sent. 7224 len. 27]: Teresa herself appeared to accept the delay as a matter of course , but her mother 's eyes were sharp enough to see through the pretence .
Parsing [sent. 7225 len. 33]: The girl was unhappy ; the girl was fretting ; her persistent cheerfulness was a cloak to cover a wound ; when she thought herself unobserved her face fell into weary lines .
Parsing [sent. 7226 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 7227 len. 26]: Teresa was unhappy , but with a mother 's jealous pride in a daughter 's attractiveness , Mrs Mallison told herself that , thank goodness !
Parsing [sent. 7228 len. 10]: it had n't spoiled the girl 's good looks .
Parsing [sent. 7229 len. 19]: She looked thinner perhaps ; a trifle older , but there was something which added to her charm .
Parsing [sent. 7230 len. 31]: She did not acknowledge in so many words that a hard face had softened , but told herself reassuringly that Dane would notice the improvement , -- when he returned !
Parsing [sent. 7231 len. 21]: Anxiety about her daughters had made Mrs Mallison more than usually unobservant of her husband during the last few months .
Parsing [sent. 7232 len. 17]: She cherished one or two axioms concerning him which lived on unchanged from year to year .
Parsing [sent. 7233 len. 37]: One was that `` Papa was always ailing , '' another that `` Papa was so tiresome , '' a third that in dealing with Papa , it was wisdom to `` take no notice . ''
Parsing [sent. 7234 len. 20]: The cod-liver oil was the only concession she had made to the increasing weakness which she could not ignore .
Parsing [sent. 7235 len. 15]: Breakfast was finished , and half a dozen letters were distributed round the table .
Parsing [sent. 7236 len. 15]: Teresa turned over her share with an eager hand , and paled into indifference .
Parsing [sent. 7237 len. 20]: It was with an obvious effort that she tore open an envelope , and made a pretence of reading .
Parsing [sent. 7238 len. 14]: This morning at least she had made sure of a letter from Dane .
Parsing [sent. 7239 len. 24]: It was eight days since she had heard from him last , and up till now he had written regularly once a week .
Parsing [sent. 7240 len. 37]: They were not lover-like letters , those chronicles of daily doings , and allusions to the leading events of the day , but such as they were , they made the sum of Teresa 's life .
Parsing [sent. 7241 len. 31]: She read each letter many times , yearning to find in it some trace of returning love , and once or twice of late she had believed the search successful .
Parsing [sent. 7242 len. 27]: On one occasion her own weekly letter had been delayed , and Dane wrote that he had been uneasy all day fearing that she was ill .
Parsing [sent. 7243 len. 32]: Again , writing of the loneliness of a life among strangers , he had afterwards inserted a closely written phrase : '' _ Less lonely after your sweet words _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7244 len. 11]: Teresa read that sentence with a thrill of intensest relief .
Parsing [sent. 7245 len. 30]: Throughout the months of separation , she had persistently written to Dane in the same outspoken loving manner as she had done before the fateful visit to Gled Bay .
Parsing [sent. 7246 len. 36]: He knew that she loved him , she was trusting to that love as the magnet which should draw him back to her side , and would not allow pride to stand in its way .
Parsing [sent. 7247 len. 20]: Nevertheless , receiving those formally written answers , it was inevitable that she should experience moments of smarting doubt .
Parsing [sent. 7248 len. 11]: Was she humbling herself to reap only impatience and contempt ?
Parsing [sent. 7249 len. 14]: And then , after five long months , had come that blessed reassurement .
Parsing [sent. 7250 len. 10]: `` Less lonely , after your sweet words ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7251 len. 18]: Teresa had gone proudly after the receipt of that message , but she was hungry for more .
Parsing [sent. 7252 len. 12]: The waiting seemed longer than ever , now that hope revived .
Parsing [sent. 7253 len. 31]: This morning at breakfast Teresa 's thoughts were so busily occupied with her _ fiance _ that she barely realised the meaning of the words on the sheet before her .
Parsing [sent. 7254 len. 30]: She was automatically turning to read them once more when her attention was attracted by a movement at the end of the table where her father had his place .
Parsing [sent. 7255 len. 38]: A moment before the Major had opened a long business-like letter which he still clasped in both hands , but he had fallen back in his chair , and his face was blanched and terrible to behold .
Parsing [sent. 7256 len. 25]: As Teresa stared in amaze it seemed to her that with every second his body was changing , growing smaller , and more helpless .
Parsing [sent. 7257 len. 4]: `` Father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7258 len. 4]: she cried loudly .
Parsing [sent. 7259 len. 4]: `` Father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7260 len. 20]: but he had no eyes for her , he was staring across the table into his wife 's face .
Parsing [sent. 7261 len. 4]: `` Margaret ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7262 len. 3]: he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 7263 len. 3]: `` Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 7264 len. 4]: It is ruin !
Parsing [sent. 7265 len. 30]: I am a murderer , Margaret , a thief -- I 've played with the money that belonged to you , and the children , and it 's gone .
Parsing [sent. 7266 len. 6]: We are ruined , Margaret !
Parsing [sent. 7267 len. 6]: -- it is all gone .
Parsing [sent. 7268 len. 5]: What have I done !
Parsing [sent. 7269 len. 6]: What have I done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7270 len. 12]: Mrs Mallison rose from her seat and hurried round the table .
Parsing [sent. 7271 len. 39]: She opened her arms as she went ; they were wide open when she reached her husband 's side , and he shrank into them , his head sliding downward on her shoulder with a strange unnatural looseness .
Parsing [sent. 7272 len. 27]: `` As if he had no neck , '' Teresa thought to herself as she looked on , `` as if he had no neck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7273 len. 9]: `` There , my dear , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7274 len. 11]: cried the wife tenderly , `` do n't get upset !
Parsing [sent. 7275 len. 12]: Whatever you 've done , you meant it for the best .
Parsing [sent. 7276 len. 11]: We know you well enough to be sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 7277 len. 7]: There , my dear , there !
Parsing [sent. 7278 len. 27]: You 've been good to us for thirty-five years -- we 're not going to blame you if you 've made a mistake now ... Teresa !
Parsing [sent. 7279 len. 13]: speak to your father ... comfort him ... Henry , look up !
Parsing [sent. 7280 len. 11]: ... My God ... Henry , _ speak _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7281 len. 47]: Her voice rose to a wail , for even as she spoke , even as she cradled him in her arms , the bolt fell , -- so suddenly , so swiftly , that one second it was not , and the next it was there .
Parsing [sent. 7282 len. 21]: One side of the face crumpled and fell , the eye closed , the mouth stretched in a ghastly grin .
Parsing [sent. 7283 len. 23]: His wife seized his right arm , and shook it violently , but it fell to his side , heavy as lead .
Parsing [sent. 7284 len. 11]: Within the loose tweed coat the shoulder seemed to disappear .
Parsing [sent. 7285 len. 6]: `` Mother , Mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7286 len. 12]: cried Teresa wildly , `` you were so kind to him .
Parsing [sent. 7287 len. 14]: You were so kind ... You did n't blame him one bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 7288 len. 17]: They got him to bed and sent for the doctor , but he never regained consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 7289 len. 11]: Before the afternoon was over he had breathed his last .
Parsing [sent. 7290 len. 20]: `` And now , I suppose , '' Mrs Mallison said dully , `` Mary will come home . ''
Parsing [sent. 7291 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTY .
Parsing [sent. 7292 len. 3]: A MEETING .
Parsing [sent. 7293 len. 28]: Mary came speeding home by the first train after receipt of the telegraphic message , and arrived at the Cottage on the afternoon of the following day .
Parsing [sent. 7294 len. 25]: A strange maid with a scared expression opened the door , and stared aghast as the new arrival pushed past her into the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 7295 len. 28]: The room was empty , and Mary stood upon the threshold looking round the familiar scene , which seemed so strangely altered by her year 's absence .
Parsing [sent. 7296 len. 21]: The blinds were drawn , but even in the half-lights its proportions appeared shrunken , its furnishings shabby and poor .
Parsing [sent. 7297 len. 30]: On the centre table stood a bowl of spring flowers , and two or three store catalogues , certain pages of which were marked with strips of writing paper .
Parsing [sent. 7298 len. 56]: It seemed to Mary that those books had lain in identically the same positions on the morning on which she had left home , but then the marked pages had been those of Trousseaux , and now ... Instinctively she opened the nearest volume , and shrank at the sight of monumental stones and crosses .
Parsing [sent. 7299 len. 14]: The next moment the door opened , and Mrs Mallison entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 7300 len. 31]: From an upper room she had heard the sounds of arrival , and for the moment the mother in her forgot everything but the fact that her child had returned .
Parsing [sent. 7301 len. 36]: She held out her arms , and smiled with twitching lips , and Mary ran to her , and clung round her neck , with arms which seemed as if they would never let go .
Parsing [sent. 7302 len. 47]: It was not the thought of her father that prompted that close embrace , it was the remembrance of a year of days spent in establishments , a year of aimless hours , a year of living among strangers , who cared nothing , noticed nothing !
Parsing [sent. 7303 len. 5]: neither praised nor blamed .
Parsing [sent. 7304 len. 34]: She had tasted liberty , and liberty had been sweet , but there was a great loneliness in her heart , and the clasp of mother arms were as balm to a wound .
Parsing [sent. 7305 len. 6]: `` Mother , Mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7306 len. 4]: gasped Mary sobbing .
Parsing [sent. 7307 len. 6]: `` Mary , Mary ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7308 len. 21]: quavered Mrs Mallison in reply , then at last they drew apart , regarding each other , with half-shy scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 7309 len. 42]: Mrs Mallison had rushed into the orthodox fitments with a haste which seemed to Teresa positively indecent , but it obviously soothed the widow to don her new cap , and stitch muslin cuffs and collar on a black silk dress .
Parsing [sent. 7310 len. 27]: The result , taken in conjunction with a natural paleness of complexion , was undoubtedly softening , and made a further appeal to Mary 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 7311 len. 7]: `` You look pale , Mother .
Parsing [sent. 7312 len. 5]: You are not ill ?
Parsing [sent. 7313 len. 7]: Oh , do n't be ill !
Parsing [sent. 7314 len. 8]: We ca n't spare you too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7315 len. 8]: `` No , no , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 7316 len. 5]: I am quite well .
Parsing [sent. 7317 len. 12]: It was a great shock ... but there was no nursing .
Parsing [sent. 7318 len. 12]: It would have been worse if he 'd been ill long .
Parsing [sent. 7319 len. 23]: Sit down , my dear ... You must have some milk ... He came down to breakfast quite himself , but depressed .
Parsing [sent. 7320 len. 16]: He had been depressed -- '' She saw Mary wince , and hurried into explanations .
Parsing [sent. 7321 len. 11]: -- `` About business ... Not you , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 7322 len. 6]: He had got over that .
Parsing [sent. 7323 len. 9]: So interested in your letters ... Poor Papa !
Parsing [sent. 7324 len. 12]: investments had been bad , and he was led into speculation .
Parsing [sent. 7325 len. 4]: I never suspected .
Parsing [sent. 7326 len. 7]: -- He never confided in me .
Parsing [sent. 7327 len. 7]: He knew that I should object .
Parsing [sent. 7328 len. 6]: Papa could be very self-willed .
Parsing [sent. 7329 len. 29]: It 's the way with these mild characters ; all of a sudden they get the bit in their teeth , and there 's no stopping them . ''
Parsing [sent. 7330 len. 14]: She saw Mary wince again , and gave a peal to the bell .
Parsing [sent. 7331 len. 7]: `` You must have some milk !
Parsing [sent. 7332 len. 3]: Or tea ?
Parsing [sent. 7333 len. 6]: Shall I hurry up tea ?
Parsing [sent. 7334 len. 20]: Tea , please , Mason , and do n't toast the muffin until you 've brought in the tray .
Parsing [sent. 7335 len. 5]: It was cold yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 7336 len. 25]: -- I was telling you , Mary , that he had had bad news ... opened a letter after breakfast and there it was .
Parsing [sent. 7337 len. 15]: -- He read it through , and called out to me : ` Margaret !
Parsing [sent. 7338 len. 3]: Margaret ! '
Parsing [sent. 7339 len. 12]: ... '' The large , complacent face shivered suddenly into tears .
Parsing [sent. 7340 len. 15]: `` It was years -- years -- since he had called me that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7341 len. 12]: Mary took out her handkerchief , and wiped her own eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7342 len. 23]: She was sorry for her mother , but the habit of thinking first of herself had grown too strong to be overcome .
Parsing [sent. 7343 len. 11]: `` Did he -- did he speak of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7344 len. 9]: `` My dear , there was no time .
Parsing [sent. 7345 len. 12]: It fell on him at that very moment -- the stroke !
Parsing [sent. 7346 len. 5]: He never spoke again .
Parsing [sent. 7347 len. 9]: Those were his last words , ` Margaret !
Parsing [sent. 7348 len. 3]: Margaret ! '
Parsing [sent. 7349 len. 20]: -- as he used to call to me when we were young , before you children were born . ''
Parsing [sent. 7350 len. 15]: There was evident solace in the remembrance , despite the tears which it evoked .
Parsing [sent. 7351 len. 37]: Mary made a futile effort to conjure up a picture of youthful parents , loving each other , living in happy comradeship , and then reverted to her mother 's words of a few moments before .
Parsing [sent. 7352 len. 4]: `` Bad news !
Parsing [sent. 7353 len. 2]: Speculations ?
Parsing [sent. 7354 len. 8]: ... How much had he lost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7355 len. 14]: Mrs Mallison 's hands twitched , she clasped them tightly upon her knee .
Parsing [sent. 7356 len. 6]: `` He said -- all !
Parsing [sent. 7357 len. 5]: He said -- ruin !
Parsing [sent. 7358 len. 9]: It 's too early yet to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 7359 len. 15]: Mr Maitland will make enquiries ... I knew he had been selling out shares .
Parsing [sent. 7360 len. 11]: I thought it was to reinvest in some better security .
Parsing [sent. 7361 len. 7]: Papa was always close about business .
Parsing [sent. 7362 len. 27]: If he speculated with the principal , and it has gone , it will be '' -- the hands jerked once more -- `` ruin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7363 len. 16]: `` You will have five hundred a year , Mother , '' Mary said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 7364 len. 22]: `` Teresa will marry , and you and I -- we can be quite comfortable on five hundred a year . ''
Parsing [sent. 7365 len. 52]: Mrs Mallison 's eyes shot out a sideways glance , and beheld before her the Mary of old , seated with bowed back and bowed head in her old chair in the corner by the fire-place , and the year that had passed rolled from her memory like a worrying dream .
Parsing [sent. 7366 len. 14]: `` Of course , '' she said briskly , `` we must remove .
Parsing [sent. 7367 len. 10]: There will be no necessity for so many rooms .
Parsing [sent. 7368 len. 23]: If we put out the washing we can manage quite nicely with one maid , and you to assist in the mornings .
Parsing [sent. 7369 len. 16]: After being idle for so long , you will enjoy making yourself of use . ''
Parsing [sent. 7370 len. 10]: `` I think I shall , '' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 7371 len. 5]: And she meant it .
Parsing [sent. 7372 len. 16]: The maid brought in the tray at that moment , the subject was necessarily dropped .
Parsing [sent. 7373 len. 16]: Probably a fortune of ten thousand pounds has never changed hands so swiftly and silently !
Parsing [sent. 7374 len. 31]: From that hour to the day of her death , Mrs Mallison showed no sign of realising that she was living on her daughter 's money , not her own .
Parsing [sent. 7375 len. 67]: The tea was poured out , the muffin was brought in , piping hot , under its silver cover , before Teresa made her appearance , and Mary , staring with blank eyes at a tall , thin girl , with pale cheeks and listless eyes , felt that this was not the Teresa of yore , but a stranger with whom she had no acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 7376 len. 20]: The sisters embraced , in silence , and with a listlessness as pronounced on one side as the other .
Parsing [sent. 7377 len. 18]: There was no sign in Teresa 's manner of the remorseful affection which her letter had expressed .
Parsing [sent. 7378 len. 8]: `` She looks -- like me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7379 len. 16]: said Mary to herself , and her eyes strayed to her sister 's left hand .
Parsing [sent. 7380 len. 27]: The flash of diamonds showed that there was no avowed breach with Dane , though the mystery of the deferred marriage was still to be solved .
Parsing [sent. 7381 len. 24]: Mary found no clue thereto in her mother 's continued monologue , though it was discursive enough to take in the whole countryside .
Parsing [sent. 7382 len. 24]: `` Teresa will be glad to have you back -- so much to do ... The bell has been ringing all day long .
Parsing [sent. 7383 len. 3]: Lovely flowers !
Parsing [sent. 7384 len. 8]: A wreath of lilies from the Court .
Parsing [sent. 7385 len. 15]: And there will be the cards ... We shall have to draw one out .
Parsing [sent. 7386 len. 16]: There _ were _ no kind enquiries , so we ca n't thank for them .
Parsing [sent. 7387 len. 10]: It was so sudden ; only a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 7388 len. 17]: He called out for me -- I went to him , and held his poor head .
Parsing [sent. 7389 len. 6]: Teresa said I was kind .
Parsing [sent. 7390 len. 6]: Of course I was kind !
Parsing [sent. 7391 len. 23]: He called me ` Margaret , ' and then -- in a minute ... was n't it only a minute , Teresa ?
Parsing [sent. 7392 len. 4]: he was gone !
Parsing [sent. 7393 len. 4]: ... Poor Henry !
Parsing [sent. 7394 len. 3]: Poor Papa !
Parsing [sent. 7395 len. 45]: The shock was too much ... ` Mrs and the Misses Mallison return warm thanks for kind sympathy in their sad and sudden bereavement , ' something like that ... They have a book at the stationer 's , with a selection drawn out .
Parsing [sent. 7396 len. 12]: I 've seen them at the end of the Christmas mottoes .
Parsing [sent. 7397 len. 12]: We 'll telephone ... The Vicar will be in again presently .
Parsing [sent. 7398 len. 3]: Most attentive .
Parsing [sent. 7399 len. 7]: He enquired for you , Mary .
Parsing [sent. 7400 len. 6]: I said we had wired .
Parsing [sent. 7401 len. 8]: He felt quite sure you would come .
Parsing [sent. 7402 len. 6]: Mrs Evans sent a cross .
Parsing [sent. 7403 len. 6]: Mrs Beverley 's were coloured .
Parsing [sent. 7404 len. 10]: Pale pink roses , and a note with them .
Parsing [sent. 7405 len. 7]: Very feeling , I must say .
Parsing [sent. 7406 len. 9]: Being an orphan herself , she can understand .
Parsing [sent. 7407 len. 6]: Only cards from the Court .
Parsing [sent. 7408 len. 10]: We 've seen nothing of them this last year .
Parsing [sent. 7409 len. 22]: The Squire 's mother died , so they do n't entertain , and Lady Cassandra and Mrs Beverley are always together .
Parsing [sent. 7410 len. 14]: Of course , as I tell Teresa , she 's so much younger .
Parsing [sent. 7411 len. 11]: Teresa is looking thinner , Mary , is n't she ?
Parsing [sent. 7412 len. 3]: Quite slim .
Parsing [sent. 7413 len. 8]: You have n't altered , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 7414 len. 5]: I see no difference .
Parsing [sent. 7415 len. 10]: I thought perhaps you 'd have changed your hair .
Parsing [sent. 7416 len. 3]: -- No !
Parsing [sent. 7417 len. 37]: Papa did n't speak of you specially ; he had n't time , but he spoke of his children , -- something about ruining me and the children -- he thought of us , not himself .
Parsing [sent. 7418 len. 18]: I said to him , whatever he had done , he had done it for the best .
Parsing [sent. 7419 len. 9]: Mr Hunter said the same thing this morning .
Parsing [sent. 7420 len. 8]: He came in to offer to help .
Parsing [sent. 7421 len. 13]: He is looking after the -- er , ... arranging for Thursday .
Parsing [sent. 7422 len. 12]: Quite simple , I told him , but _ good _ .
Parsing [sent. 7423 len. 9]: I could not bear to skimp for Papa .
Parsing [sent. 7424 len. 21]: The dressmaker 's coming at six ... '' Her face quivered and a stray tear rolled slowly down her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 7425 len. 6]: `` He looks so peaceful !
Parsing [sent. 7426 len. 12]: ... Afterwards -- you must come up ... '' Mary shrank .
Parsing [sent. 7427 len. 60]: She did not want to see the still , changed effigy of what had been ; she wanted to remember her father as the quiet man who had kissed her on the doorstep , and said : `` My dear , I hope you may have a pleasant time , '' but she had not the courage to refuse .
Parsing [sent. 7428 len. 19]: She looked appealingly at Teresa , and saw a sudden wave of feeling sweep over the pale face .
Parsing [sent. 7429 len. 28]: From without came the sound of wheels , a heavy , lumbering sound which to Chumley ears announced the advent of one of the venerable station flies .
Parsing [sent. 7430 len. 18]: The next moment the bell rang , and a man 's footstep was heard in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 7431 len. 5]: `` The Vicar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7432 len. 29]: murmured Mrs Mallison , but Mary knew it was not the Vicar ; the look on her sister 's face announced too surely the name of the new-comer .
Parsing [sent. 7433 len. 25]: There came a pause , while the new maid was escorting the visitor into the drawing-room , and came back to announce his name .
Parsing [sent. 7434 len. 5]: `` Captain Peignton . ''
Parsing [sent. 7435 len. 11]: Teresa took the words out of her mother 's mouth .
Parsing [sent. 7436 len. 8]: `` Ask him to come here . ''
Parsing [sent. 7437 len. 34]: She rose from her seat , and stood waiting , so calm , so dignified , so arresting in her slim young pallor , that Mrs Mallison 's reproaches died on her lips .
Parsing [sent. 7438 len. 33]: She rose in her turn , and stood beside her daughter with an unconscious air of protection , and then Dane entered , and the long-dreaded , long-prayed-for meeting had taken place .
Parsing [sent. 7439 len. 16]: He came forward , eager , sympathetic , his own embarrassment forgotten in affectionate concern .
Parsing [sent. 7440 len. 66]: Looking at him as he entered , one divined that his impulse was to kiss and caress , as he had been accustomed to do in the early days of his engagement , but that impulse received a check at the sight of the two waiting figures , -- Mrs Mallison in her widow 's trappings , and beside her , the white silent girl .
Parsing [sent. 7441 len. 32]: Dane shared Mary 's dazed feeling of meeting a stranger , as he shook Teresa 's limp hand , which yet had strength enough to hold him at arm 's length .
Parsing [sent. 7442 len. 39]: He heard her voice enquiring as to the comfort of his journey , offering him tea and cakes ; there was in it a note of detachment which he had never before heard when she was addressing himself .
Parsing [sent. 7443 len. 29]: As he drank his tea , and listened to the hum of Mrs Mallison 's reiterated reminiscences , Dane was conscious of a feeling of flatness and disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 7444 len. 12]: The year 's absence from Chumley had wrought the inevitable result .
Parsing [sent. 7445 len. 59]: He loved Cassandra none the less , but the eyes that had been blinded by passion could now discern that he had been saved from a great wrong , and if life still appeared grey and barren , he acknowledged that he had escaped the harder fate of attaining his desire at the cost of bitterness of soul .
Parsing [sent. 7446 len. 23]: And throughout the months of struggle , this girl 's tenderness had enveloped him , an unfaltering tenderness , undaunted by neglect .
Parsing [sent. 7447 len. 82]: It was only during the last few months that Dane had begun to realise the healing quality of that tenderness , to count the days until the arrival of the weekly letter , to find himself mentally repeating its phrases ; slowly , but surely , his wounded heart had been opening to take comfort in Teresa 's love , and when suddenly she was plunged into trouble , he had hurried to her , with a genuine impulse of tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 7448 len. 19]: In imagination he had seen her face lighten with joy , had felt her arms around his neck .
Parsing [sent. 7449 len. 17]: -- It was the most startling thing in the world to find Teresa _ cold _ !
Parsing [sent. 7450 len. 33]: When tea was over Mary lifted her gloves and veil murmuring some unintelligible words , whereupon Teresa rose so quickly as to give the idea that she was glad of the excuse .
Parsing [sent. 7451 len. 7]: `` I will come with you !
Parsing [sent. 7452 len. 7]: Your room is not quite ready .
Parsing [sent. 7453 len. 7]: You must come to mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 7454 len. 13]: She turned to Dane holding out her hand with a flickering smile .
Parsing [sent. 7455 len. 8]: `` You will excuse me , Dane .
Parsing [sent. 7456 len. 35]: We are so busy ... The Vicar is coming in later , and Mr Hunter , and the dressmaker ... There 's so much to be done ... We will see you again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7457 len. 17]: She turned away , without waiting for a reply , and Dane reseated himself in silence .
Parsing [sent. 7458 len. 28]: To say that he was surprised , but feebly expresses his sentiments ; he was stunned , he could hardly persuade himself that he had heard aright .
Parsing [sent. 7459 len. 25]: He looked eagerly at Mrs Mallison , seeking a clue from her , and beheld a kindred surprise , mingled with an unmistakable complacence .
Parsing [sent. 7460 len. 60]: Obviously the mother approved of her daughter 's reserve , and felt a natural satisfaction in his rebuff , but before the silence had continued long enough to become awkward , she remembered her duties as hostess , and vouchsafed an explanation : `` Mary arrived just before tea ... They have not seen each other for a year .
Parsing [sent. 7461 len. 11]: -- So much has happened ... '' `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 7462 len. 12]: Just so ... I quite understand , '' Dane said vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 7463 len. 14]: Then , after a moment 's pause , `` Teresa looks thin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7464 len. 4]: he added anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 7465 len. 11]: `` This has been a great shock to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 7466 len. 4]: `` M-yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7467 len. 4]: Mrs Mallison said .
Parsing [sent. 7468 len. 47]: Just the one word , yet Dane found himself flushing guiltily , and realising that he was _ meant _ to realise that no shock , however great , could alter a girl 's physique , as Teresa had altered since he had seen her last .
Parsing [sent. 7469 len. 9]: He dropped the subject , and tried another .
Parsing [sent. 7470 len. 13]: `` I came as quickly as I could after getting the news .
Parsing [sent. 7471 len. 10]: I hoped I might be in time to help .
Parsing [sent. 7472 len. 13]: What arrangements , ... can I help you to make arrangements ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7473 len. 11]: `` Thank you very much , but everything is settled .
Parsing [sent. 7474 len. 7]: Mr Hunter is looking after everything .
Parsing [sent. 7475 len. 10]: I expect him this evening to talk over details .
Parsing [sent. 7476 len. 9]: The day after to-morrow , at twelve o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 7477 len. 10]: Will it be possible for you to stay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7478 len. 17]: Again Dane was conscious of shock , followed by a pang of something curiously like irritation .
Parsing [sent. 7479 len. 2]: Hunter ?
Parsing [sent. 7480 len. 11]: How did Hunter come to be on such intimate terms ?
Parsing [sent. 7481 len. 16]: Then he remembered that Hunter was a doctor , and felt a rising of spirits .
Parsing [sent. 7482 len. 3]: Of course !
Parsing [sent. 7483 len. 3]: Quite natural !
Parsing [sent. 7484 len. 6]: Hunter had been in attendance .
Parsing [sent. 7485 len. 7]: `` Of course I shall stay .
Parsing [sent. 7486 len. 14]: I hope I may be of some use to you later , on .
Parsing [sent. 7487 len. 10]: I 'm glad you had someone on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 7488 len. 10]: Hunter is the young doctor , is n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 7489 len. 12]: Extraordinarily kind , these doctor fellows on occasions like these ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7490 len. 41]: `` M-yes , '' said Mrs Mallison once more , and there rose before Dane 's eyes a picture of Teresa , in a white dress , dispensing garden tea , with a tall young figure assiduously waiting upon her .
Parsing [sent. 7491 len. 10]: Once more he realised that that `` M-yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7492 len. 14]: was meant to imply that more than mere professional interest was at stake .
Parsing [sent. 7493 len. 18]: The sound of a bell jingled through the quiet house , and Dane rose from his chair .
Parsing [sent. 7494 len. 44]: Of old he had been as a son in this house , treated with affection and familiarity , but at this moment he felt an intruder , whose presence was merely an inconvenience , taking up time which should have been bestowed elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 7495 len. 28]: He held out his hand , and said : `` At what hour to-morrow will it be most convenient for me to call to see Teresa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7496 len. 22]: `` I will ask her , '' Mrs Mallison said , and left the room , to return with astonishing quickness .
Parsing [sent. 7497 len. 17]: Evidently there had been no hesitation about the reply ; evidently also the maternal judgment approved .
Parsing [sent. 7498 len. 14]: `` Teresa says she will be glad if you will excuse her to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 7499 len. 7]: There is so much to do .
Parsing [sent. 7500 len. 12]: She would rather leave her own affairs until after the funeral .
Parsing [sent. 7501 len. 11]: Perhaps you will come in to tea on Thursday . ''
Parsing [sent. 7502 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 7503 len. 7]: I will come in after tea .
Parsing [sent. 7504 len. 4]: About five o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 7505 len. 7]: I am staying at the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 7506 len. 13]: Please let me know if there is anything I can do . ''
Parsing [sent. 7507 len. 25]: He kept his voice resolutely controlled , but his anger showed in sparkling eye , and a rising of colour over cheek and brow .
Parsing [sent. 7508 len. 10]: Mrs Mallison regarded these signs with a natural satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 7509 len. 13]: It was not in feminine human nature to resist one parting thrust .
Parsing [sent. 7510 len. 22]: `` One day , '' she said suavely , `` can not matter , when you have waited so long ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7511 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 7512 len. 4]: THE SECOND BEST .
Parsing [sent. 7513 len. 12]: Dane awoke next morning to face a long and difficult day .
Parsing [sent. 7514 len. 33]: Idle hours are proverbially dedicated to temptation , and despite many resolutions his thoughts drifted continually towards Cassandra , continually emphasised her nearness , and dallied with the possibility of a meeting .
Parsing [sent. 7515 len. 21]: He swore that such a meeting should not be his own doing , but what if chance brought it about ?
Parsing [sent. 7516 len. 17]: For some moments he permitted himself to envisage possibilities , then sternly called himself to order .
Parsing [sent. 7517 len. 18]: Teresa in sorrow demanded an undivided loyalty ; her tenderness during the past year riveted her claims .
Parsing [sent. 7518 len. 62]: He determined to telephone to the Squire , apologise for his own inability to call at the Court , and try to arrange a meeting in town , but half an hour later as he stood on the step of the hotel , he saw the familiar dog-cart driving towards him , and heard himself hailed in loud , well-known tones .
Parsing [sent. 7519 len. 5]: `` Halloa , Peignton !
Parsing [sent. 7520 len. 5]: Heard you were here .
Parsing [sent. 7521 len. 9]: Drove round to say how d'you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 7522 len. 9]: The Squire gave the reins to the groom .
Parsing [sent. 7523 len. 21]: `` I 'll come inside and have a smoke ... Poor old fellow went off in a hurry , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 7524 len. 9]: S'pose you are staying over the funeral ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7525 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 7526 len. 4]: Till Friday morning .
Parsing [sent. 7527 len. 6]: I 'm glad you called .
Parsing [sent. 7528 len. 24]: I was going to ring you up , and explain that I should have no time to pay calls ... '' `` No .
Parsing [sent. 7529 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 7530 len. 4]: Of course not .
Parsing [sent. 7531 len. 15]: Son of the house ; you 'll have the whole show on your hands .
Parsing [sent. 7532 len. 5]: And Teresa , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 7533 len. 10]: Bit of lost time to make up , what ?
Parsing [sent. 7534 len. 39]: Thought you were never going to turn up again ... You know your own business best , of course ... '' `` I do , '' Dane said firmly , but the Squire was not sensitive to rebuffs .
Parsing [sent. 7535 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7536 len. 13]: -- he said slowly -- `` that is as it may be .
Parsing [sent. 7537 len. 36]: All the same , if you leave things much longer , and she falls to pieces as she 's been doing lately , there 'll be no Teresa left ... Bad business this money trouble !
Parsing [sent. 7538 len. 17]: Who would have thought that solemn old buffer could have been such a giddy owl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7539 len. 14]: Dane sat , unlighted cigarette in hand , gazing at him in dismay .
Parsing [sent. 7540 len. 6]: `` What money trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7541 len. 11]: `` Mean to say you do n't _ know _ ?
Parsing [sent. 7542 len. 7]: They did n't tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7543 len. 5]: `` Not a word .
Parsing [sent. 7544 len. 6]: Money was not mentioned . ''
Parsing [sent. 7545 len. 4]: `` Odd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7546 len. 8]: The Squire cocked a suspicious eyebrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 7547 len. 9]: _ Very _ odd , considering your position .
Parsing [sent. 7548 len. 4]: Evans told me .
Parsing [sent. 7549 len. 5]: No secret about it .
Parsing [sent. 7550 len. 7]: It 's over the whole place .
Parsing [sent. 7551 len. 19]: The old man had been selling out shares , and reinvesting under the advice of some unprincipled scoundrel .
Parsing [sent. 7552 len. 32]: The old story -- a huge fraud , got up for the special benefit of rural investors , ten per cent , interest , paid once ; and then -- smash !
Parsing [sent. 7553 len. 30]: The poor old fellow got the news at the breakfast table , called out to his wife that he was ruined , and fizzled up , then and there .
Parsing [sent. 7554 len. 10]: Had a stroke , and died in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 7555 len. 17]: Far as Evans understands there 'll be nothing left for 'em but a twopenny pension . ''
Parsing [sent. 7556 len. 9]: Dane was silent , digesting the startling news .
Parsing [sent. 7557 len. 45]: The _ menage _ at the Cottage had suggested a comfortable , if modest income ; in the one official interview which he had had with the Major , he had been informed that Teresa would eventually inherit some seven or eight thousand pounds .
Parsing [sent. 7558 len. 22]: Now , by all accounts , the prospective fortune had vanished , and she was left penniless , dependent on -- ?
Parsing [sent. 7559 len. 3]: On what ?
Parsing [sent. 7560 len. 13]: The answer to that question came in a rush of tender understanding .
Parsing [sent. 7561 len. 7]: Poor , poor , little girl !
Parsing [sent. 7562 len. 10]: Was _ this _ the reason of her coldness ?
Parsing [sent. 7563 len. 21]: Did she fear that a sense of duty would urge him to a marriage from which his heart still shrank ?
Parsing [sent. 7564 len. 7]: Poor , proud , little girl !
Parsing [sent. 7565 len. 23]: While she had something to give , she could plead her own cause , but a penniless Teresa would accept no favour .
Parsing [sent. 7566 len. 17]: On the whole the news of the Major 's losses brought Dane more relief than sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 7567 len. 9]: It solved the mystery of his chilling reception .
Parsing [sent. 7568 len. 5]: `` Humph -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 7569 len. 11]: bad business -- bad business , '' soliloquised the Squire .
Parsing [sent. 7570 len. 36]: `` Eldest daughter came in for a bit of money , but she 's kicked over the traces ... Rather a pill for her to settle down again with the old woman , -- what ?
Parsing [sent. 7571 len. 18]: Of course , you can look after Teresa ... '' `` I can , '' Dane said .
Parsing [sent. 7572 len. 9]: After a moment 's pause he continued deliberately .
Parsing [sent. 7573 len. 15]: `` I shall arrange for our marriage to take place as early as possible .
Parsing [sent. 7574 len. 19]: Mrs Mallison may have conventional scruples ... she probably will , but she 'll have to give way .
Parsing [sent. 7575 len. 19]: I ca n't stay longer than Friday , and I must get things settled before I leave . ''
Parsing [sent. 7576 len. 18]: He rose , and straightened his shoulders with the air of a man throwing off a weight .
Parsing [sent. 7577 len. 32]: `` You -- er -- you will tell Lady Cassandra my plans , and explain to her that my time is so limited that I -- er -- '' `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 7578 len. 2]: Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 7579 len. 10]: She would n't expect it , my dear man .
Parsing [sent. 7580 len. 23]: As a matter of fact she and Mrs Beverley are off in town for the day , -- frock-hunting , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 7581 len. 6]: They 're always at it .
Parsing [sent. 7582 len. 7]: Ripping little woman , Mrs Beverley !
Parsing [sent. 7583 len. 13]: lots of fun , but plenty of common sense tucked away inside .
Parsing [sent. 7584 len. 16]: Been a regular godsend to Cassandra ... '' `` Lady Cassandra is quite well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7585 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7586 len. 7]: the Squire protruded his under lip .
Parsing [sent. 7587 len. 5]: `` So , so .
Parsing [sent. 7588 len. 9]: Had a bit of a breakdown in autumn .
Parsing [sent. 7589 len. 12]: We had a hard time of it , after you left .
Parsing [sent. 7590 len. 22]: My old Mater had a stroke , and we were down in Devonshire looking after her for a couple of months .
Parsing [sent. 7591 len. 35]: She got on like a house on fire : helpless , you know -- could n't stir out of bed , but keen as a needle , took in all that was going on .
Parsing [sent. 7592 len. 5]: Cassandra nursed her . ''
Parsing [sent. 7593 len. 13]: The Squire flicked the ash from his cigarette with a ruminating air .
Parsing [sent. 7594 len. 6]: `` Rum things , women !
Parsing [sent. 7595 len. 9]: Hated each other like poison , those two .
Parsing [sent. 7596 len. 17]: That 's to say the Mater hated Cass ; jealous , because she was my wife .
Parsing [sent. 7597 len. 10]: Cass did n't hate her ... too much trouble .
Parsing [sent. 7598 len. 5]: She was simply bored .
Parsing [sent. 7599 len. 11]: She 's given to being bored ; you know that .
Parsing [sent. 7600 len. 7]: She 's bored with your Teresa .
Parsing [sent. 7601 len. 6]: Grizel 's the passion nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 7602 len. 5]: Grizel is always perfect .
Parsing [sent. 7603 len. 9]: But she was good to the old Mater .
Parsing [sent. 7604 len. 19]: Nursed her like a brick , and the old Mater lay there by the hour staring at Cass .
Parsing [sent. 7605 len. 30]: The last words she spoke to me , -- did I tell you she had a third stroke , and died suddenly , just as we were coming home ?
Parsing [sent. 7606 len. 8]: -- her last words were about Cass .
Parsing [sent. 7607 len. 10]: Thought she needed looking after , ... cheering up .
Parsing [sent. 7608 len. 26]: -- It was a great comfort to me , Peignton , that the old Mater and Cass were on good terms at the last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7609 len. 13]: `` I am quite sure it was , '' Dane said sincerely .
Parsing [sent. 7610 len. 43]: He was trying to banish a picture that rose before him , of the paralysed old woman with the dead body , and the live eyes that watched , hour after hour , the beautiful tragic face of her son 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 7611 len. 8]: How much had the old Mater seen ?
Parsing [sent. 7612 len. 6]: How much had she divined ?
Parsing [sent. 7613 len. 27]: The next morning Dane stood by Teresa 's side in the graveyard of the old church , and drove back to the Cottage by her side .
Parsing [sent. 7614 len. 22]: In the afternoon he paid a second visit , and found the Vicar and his wife drinking tea with the mourners .
Parsing [sent. 7615 len. 40]: The two girls were silent and self-contained , but the emotions of the day had had an exciting effect on Mrs Mallison 's nerves , with the gruesome result that she appeared to be in the highest of spirits .
Parsing [sent. 7616 len. 33]: Her voluble tongue discussed times past , present , and to come , and very pointedly she gave her hearers to understand that no condolences were necessary on the score of poverty .
Parsing [sent. 7617 len. 22]: `` We shall give up the Cottage -- it is unnecessarily large now that Papa 's two rooms will be empty .
Parsing [sent. 7618 len. 13]: Is there any chance of Oak Lea falling vacant , Mrs Evans ?
Parsing [sent. 7619 len. 17]: That 's the kind of house that would suit us , would n't it , Mary ?
Parsing [sent. 7620 len. 23]: Two nice sitting-rooms , three or four bedrooms , and not too much garden to manage with a man once a week .
Parsing [sent. 7621 len. 9]: I should like to keep on the cart .
Parsing [sent. 7622 len. 9]: So useful for paying calls at a distance .
Parsing [sent. 7623 len. 14]: There _ is _ a small stable at Oak Lea , I think ?
Parsing [sent. 7624 len. 4]: We 'll see !
Parsing [sent. 7625 len. 4]: We 'll see !
Parsing [sent. 7626 len. 10]: I shall quite enjoy a small , compact house .
Parsing [sent. 7627 len. 9]: Mary and I do n't need much space .
Parsing [sent. 7628 len. 11]: Teresa says we are not to count on her . ''
Parsing [sent. 7629 len. 13]: Everyone looked at Teresa , and Teresa stared fixedly at her cup .
Parsing [sent. 7630 len. 10]: Not a tinge of colour stole into her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 7631 len. 27]: When the Vicar rose to leave , his wife slipped her hand through Mary 's arm , and led her across the hall into the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 7632 len. 22]: At such a time it was natural that there should be `` private words '' and no one exhibited any surprise .
Parsing [sent. 7633 len. 20]: Mrs Evans closed the door behind her , and held Mary 's hand in a firm , motherly grasp .
Parsing [sent. 7634 len. 22]: `` Mary , dear -- I am a very old friend , -- may I give you a word of advice ?
Parsing [sent. 7635 len. 23]: In these days of grief and emotion , do n't be tempted into making plans , which you may regret later on .
Parsing [sent. 7636 len. 10]: Wait until you have had time to consider . ''
Parsing [sent. 7637 len. 14]: `` Thank you , Mrs Evans , but what is there to consider ?
Parsing [sent. 7638 len. 17]: If Mother has no money , what can I possibly do but give her mine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7639 len. 18]: `` You must share it with her , of course ; no right-minded daughter could do less .
Parsing [sent. 7640 len. 14]: But -- there are different ways of doing it , Mary , dear !
Parsing [sent. 7641 len. 6]: It is your own money .
Parsing [sent. 7642 len. 19]: You ought to reserve to yourself the right to decide , and to order your own life . ''
Parsing [sent. 7643 len. 6]: But Mary shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 7644 len. 7]: `` You do n't know Mother .
Parsing [sent. 7645 len. 3]: I do .
Parsing [sent. 7646 len. 6]: There would be no peace .
Parsing [sent. 7647 len. 12]: I 'll leave it to her to do as she likes .
Parsing [sent. 7648 len. 24]: I 've had my fling , Mrs Evans , a whole year of being alone , and free to do as I liked .
Parsing [sent. 7649 len. 7]: I -- I was very lonely .
Parsing [sent. 7650 len. 38]: I sha n't be altogether sorry ... '' Mrs Evans was silent , her keen eyes fixed upon Mary 's face searching for some sign of change or growth , but there was none to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 7651 len. 14]: The vagrant year had come and gone , and had left no mark .
Parsing [sent. 7652 len. 22]: Its end found her prepared to settle down into her old attitude of dumb submission , `` not altogether sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7653 len. 11]: Mrs Evans kissed her silently , and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 7654 len. 14]: In the drawing-room Dane and Teresa faced each other across the tea table .
Parsing [sent. 7655 len. 10]: At last they were alone , safe from interruption .
Parsing [sent. 7656 len. 33]: As the door shut behind the departing guests Dane held out his arm with a gesture of invitation , but Teresa shook her head , holding him off with a lifted hand .
Parsing [sent. 7657 len. 4]: `` Not now .
Parsing [sent. 7658 len. 3]: ... Wait !
Parsing [sent. 7659 len. 8]: There is so much to be said .
Parsing [sent. 7660 len. 6]: -- Sit down , Dane .
Parsing [sent. 7661 len. 13]: I hope you did n't think me unkind not seeing you yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 7662 len. 4]: I could n't !
Parsing [sent. 7663 len. 7]: It has been such a shock .
Parsing [sent. 7664 len. 7]: I had to think things out .
Parsing [sent. 7665 len. 6]: The money question alters everything .
Parsing [sent. 7666 len. 36]: There has not been time to go into business matters , but from all we have heard , from what the letter said , it seems that this loss was the last of a series .
Parsing [sent. 7667 len. 3]: Poor Father !
Parsing [sent. 7668 len. 24]: he must have suffered horribly , but he said nothing ; only speculated more wildly than ever , hoping to put things straight .
Parsing [sent. 7669 len. 9]: It 's a mercy Mary has her money .
Parsing [sent. 7670 len. 6]: She will look after Mother .
Parsing [sent. 7671 len. 10]: It 's her duty , but I am different .
Parsing [sent. 7672 len. 8]: I could never live on Mary . ''
Parsing [sent. 7673 len. 13]: She raised her voice , silencing the words on Danes ' tongue .
Parsing [sent. 7674 len. 13]: `` I have told them that I shall look after myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 7675 len. 9]: `` I sha n't let you do that !
Parsing [sent. 7676 len. 16]: Dear , I have only been waiting till you gave me a chance of speaking .
Parsing [sent. 7677 len. 24]: As soon as it can possibly be arranged we must -- '' But again Teresa 's voice interrupted , hastily drowning his own .
Parsing [sent. 7678 len. 5]: `` Wait , please !
Parsing [sent. 7679 len. 4]: You must wait .
Parsing [sent. 7680 len. 20]: I 'll tell you my plans , but first , there 's something I must give you back . ''
Parsing [sent. 7681 len. 24]: To his dismay he saw her draw the diamond circlet from her finger ; she held it towards him on an open palm .
Parsing [sent. 7682 len. 11]: Her lips twisted in a painful effort at a smile .
Parsing [sent. 7683 len. 14]: `` You wanted to have it a year ago , and I refused .
Parsing [sent. 7684 len. 7]: I must have seemed very bold .
Parsing [sent. 7685 len. 15]: I have often wondered since how I could have brought myself to do it .
Parsing [sent. 7686 len. 9]: I was thinking of myself , of course .
Parsing [sent. 7687 len. 6]: I do n't deny it .
Parsing [sent. 7688 len. 27]: I could not bear to give you up , and I hated the thought of the gossip , and the sympathy , and the staring eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7689 len. 33]: It hurt my pride to think of being jilted , when I 'd been so proud ... But most of all -- _ most _ of all , I thought of you !
Parsing [sent. 7690 len. 2]: Dane !
Parsing [sent. 7691 len. 5]: tell me one thing !
Parsing [sent. 7692 len. 18]: It would help me to know ... Has it been any help having my letters this year ?
Parsing [sent. 7693 len. 19]: Did being engaged to me -- as much as we were engaged -- make things better or worse ?
Parsing [sent. 7694 len. 12]: Were you one little scrap less lonely because I cared ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7695 len. 8]: Dane had refused to take the ring .
Parsing [sent. 7696 len. 9]: It was still lying on Teresa 's palm .
Parsing [sent. 7697 len. 19]: He stood over her , very pale , very drawn , his eyes gazing unfalteringly into her own .
Parsing [sent. 7698 len. 8]: `` Teresa , you have saved me !
Parsing [sent. 7699 len. 14]: If it had not been for you I should have taken my life .
Parsing [sent. 7700 len. 8]: You have been an angel of patience .
Parsing [sent. 7701 len. 11]: It has been your sweetness which saved me from despair .
Parsing [sent. 7702 len. 31]: I have taken everything from you in my own trouble , and now , when I am cured , when you have cured me , you want me no more !
Parsing [sent. 7703 len. 10]: What about those reasons that influenced you last year ?
Parsing [sent. 7704 len. 6]: Do n't they still exist ?
Parsing [sent. 7705 len. 10]: Have you grown tired of me , Teresa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7706 len. 9]: She shook her head , refusing to reply .
Parsing [sent. 7707 len. 24]: `` God knows it would be no wonder if you had ; not one girl in a thousand would have had your forbearance .
Parsing [sent. 7708 len. 6]: And -- those other reasons ?
Parsing [sent. 7709 len. 12]: Have you outgrown your fear of what people may say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7710 len. 7]: `` No , I have n't .
Parsing [sent. 7711 len. 7]: I 'm afraid I never shall .
Parsing [sent. 7712 len. 15]: But , -- it 's over , you see , '' Teresa said quickly .
Parsing [sent. 7713 len. 7]: `` It _ has _ happened .
Parsing [sent. 7714 len. 18]: A whole year has passed , Dane , and you have never once been to see me .
Parsing [sent. 7715 len. 18]: Chumley has been sorry for me for months ; it _ expects _ me to be jilted .
Parsing [sent. 7716 len. 11]: You need not worry about my sufferings in that respect .
Parsing [sent. 7717 len. 17]: The worst is over ... Besides , I have no intention of staying in Chumley . ''
Parsing [sent. 7718 len. 14]: Dane muttered a furious word , controlled himself , and put another question .
Parsing [sent. 7719 len. 10]: `` What exactly is your intention , Teresa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7720 len. 8]: `` I shall take up some work .
Parsing [sent. 7721 len. 9]: Girls always say that , and people laugh .
Parsing [sent. 7722 len. 8]: I do n't mind if they do .
Parsing [sent. 7723 len. 6]: They wo n't laugh long .
Parsing [sent. 7724 len. 4]: I shall succeed .
Parsing [sent. 7725 len. 10]: I am the sort of person who does succeed .
Parsing [sent. 7726 len. 56]: I like work , and I like to do it well ... For two or three years I shall work hard , -- so hard that I shall have no time to think ... '' She stopped , leaving the effect of an unfinished sentence , but Dane had no difficulty in divining her thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 7727 len. 17]: The sting of jealousy added force to the impulses which swept him forward to her side .
Parsing [sent. 7728 len. 22]: This time he ignored her protests , seizing her hands and drawing her close , until her face touched his own .
Parsing [sent. 7729 len. 14]: `` We 're talking nonsense , we 're talking nonsense , little girl !
Parsing [sent. 7730 len. 8]: What do we care what people say ?
Parsing [sent. 7731 len. 12]: What does it matter what the whole world chooses to believe ?
Parsing [sent. 7732 len. 15]: You belong to me , and I 'm not going to give you up !
Parsing [sent. 7733 len. 13]: You 've had your own way ; now it 's my turn .
Parsing [sent. 7734 len. 19]: You are not going to have a chance of succeeding at anything , except at being my wife !
Parsing [sent. 7735 len. 10]: Marry me , dear girl , marry me quickly !
Parsing [sent. 7736 len. 6]: I need you badly . ''
Parsing [sent. 7737 len. 5]: Teresa did not stir .
Parsing [sent. 7738 len. 20]: Seen close at hand , her face looked fair , and sweet , and young , but pitifully sad .
Parsing [sent. 7739 len. 24]: In the blue eyes there was the same sadness , and the sound of his eager words seemed but to deepen the pain .
Parsing [sent. 7740 len. 20]: She had an air of waiting with all her being for the sound of something that had not come .
Parsing [sent. 7741 len. 9]: Dane looked into her eyes , and understood .
Parsing [sent. 7742 len. 22]: Still with his arms around her he pressed her into a chair , and knelt on the floor at her feet .
Parsing [sent. 7743 len. 5]: `` Teresa , answer !
Parsing [sent. 7744 len. 9]: Have I always told you the truth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7745 len. 13]: She gave a startled look , but answered unhesitatingly `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7746 len. 15]: `` You can trust me to say just what is in my heart ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7747 len. 9]: She nodded slightly , motionless in his grasp .
Parsing [sent. 7748 len. 16]: `` Teresa , darling , '' said Dane softly , `` I love you truly .
Parsing [sent. 7749 len. 8]: I love you with a full heart .
Parsing [sent. 7750 len. 23]: It is n't remorse , and it is n't pity , and it is n't friendship ... it 's love , Teresa !
Parsing [sent. 7751 len. 15]: Look in my eyes , and see if I am speaking the truth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7752 len. 29]: But she had no need to look ; the music of love was in his voice , and , God knew , she was hungry to be convinced .
Parsing [sent. 7753 len. 32]: A year 's suffering had carried her beyond the point of finding content in mere possession , but the knowledge of Dane 's love was a salve which healed all wounds .
Parsing [sent. 7754 len. 26]: The `` something fine '' in Teresa 's nature showed itself at this moment in a generosity of reticence infinitely endearing to the masculine mind .
Parsing [sent. 7755 len. 15]: Dane waited shrinkingly to hear Cassandra 's name , but he waited in vain .
Parsing [sent. 7756 len. 48]: Teresa asked no questions , demanded no vows , -- all that was past , it was buried for ever out of mind , at the moment when for the second time she promised herself to Dane Peignton and felt his kiss of betrothal on her lips .
Parsing [sent. 7757 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 7758 len. 4]: TERESA 'S MARRIAGE .
Parsing [sent. 7759 len. 24]: Teresa 's marriage was arranged for the following August , a month which Mrs Mallison appeared to believe was clearly appointed by Providence .
Parsing [sent. 7760 len. 61]: Three months was the shortest interval which could respectably elapse between a funeral and a wedding : three months , taken in conjunction with the date of half-yearly sales , was the period necessary for the preparation of a trousseau ; quarter-day falling in September , there would be time to prepare for a removal after the wedding was over .
Parsing [sent. 7761 len. 18]: It must be a quiet wedding , of course , very quiet , but _ white _ .
Parsing [sent. 7762 len. 8]: Certainly Teresa must have a white wedding .
Parsing [sent. 7763 len. 18]: It had been talked of so much , her young friends had been asked to be bridesmaids .
Parsing [sent. 7764 len. 9]: Papa would not have liked a hole-and-corner affair .
Parsing [sent. 7765 len. 36]: Papa dead was an even more convenient Jorkins than Papa living , and , to judge from his widow 's reminiscences , would seem to have entertained strong opinions concerning the weddings of young girls .
Parsing [sent. 7766 len. 25]: Simple , of course ; quite simple , but a white dress _ and _ bridesmaids , _ and _ an assemblage of friends .
Parsing [sent. 7767 len. 9]: So sweet to be surrounded by loving hearts !
Parsing [sent. 7768 len. 5]: And a cold collation .
Parsing [sent. 7769 len. 3]: Champagne cup .
Parsing [sent. 7770 len. 10]: Handed round _ after _ the tea and coffee .
Parsing [sent. 7771 len. 8]: Two or three bottles would be ample .
Parsing [sent. 7772 len. 17]: `` Teresa , '' said the widow beaming , `` will look beautiful in charmeuse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7773 len. 48]: Peignton , like every other prospective bridegroom , would have preferred to be married in an empty church , but Teresa sparkled at the prospect of recovering her prestige in the eyes of the neighbourhood , and it was not for him to refuse her the satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 7774 len. 9]: The day after the funeral Peignton left Chumley .
Parsing [sent. 7775 len. 58]: Teresa took it for granted that he would not return until the date of the wedding , but it was arranged that during the interval she should procure the chaperonage of a married friend , and pay a week 's visit to her future home , when such important questions as carpets and wall-papers could be discussed .
Parsing [sent. 7776 len. 14]: `` We wo n't be in a hurry to furnish the whole house .
Parsing [sent. 7777 len. 21]: We 'll start with just what is necessary , and amuse ourselves with picking up the superfluities one by one .
Parsing [sent. 7778 len. 10]: It will be jolly collecting treasures on our honeymoon .
Parsing [sent. 7779 len. 17]: If we go off the beaten route , we shall find lots of happy hunting grounds .
Parsing [sent. 7780 len. 22]: It will give the sticks an added value to remember how we bought them , -- eh , little girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7781 len. 5]: Peignton said , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 7782 len. 21]: The old-time interest in the prospect of introducing Teresa to the beauties of new lands was struggling into new life .
Parsing [sent. 7783 len. 10]: The prospect of a home gained hourly in sweetness .
Parsing [sent. 7784 len. 43]: During the next few days the Chumley matrons garbed themselves in black , and , with discreetly lengthened visages , repaired to the Cottage on visits of condolence , to emerge half an hour or so later , considerably shocked and bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 7785 len. 66]: They were prepared to mourn with a widow for the loss her husband ; with a householder for the loss of income , with a mother whose daughter was neglected by her lover -- they beheld instead a complacent personage in weeds , shedding a dutiful tear for `` Papa , '' and hastily whisking it away at the remembrance of `` many blessings . ''
Parsing [sent. 7786 len. 8]: `` So much to be thankful for !
Parsing [sent. 7787 len. 7]: Mary home , and so useful .
Parsing [sent. 7788 len. 13]: Taken up her old duties , and dear little Trissie so happy !
Parsing [sent. 7789 len. 7]: The Captain , _ devoted _ .
Parsing [sent. 7790 len. 11]: His house to be done up , regardless of expense .
Parsing [sent. 7791 len. 5]: The marriage in August .
Parsing [sent. 7792 len. 7]: Quiet of course , but white .
Parsing [sent. 7793 len. 17]: Just , '' the widow declared with a sigh , `` as Papa had planned ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7794 len. 12]: On the subject of finance the good lady was equally complacent .
Parsing [sent. 7795 len. 30]: `` There had been losses ... poor Papa had been ill-advised , but if income were to be reduced , so , most appropriately , would be expenses also .
Parsing [sent. 7796 len. 10]: No one but Mary and myself to think of .
Parsing [sent. 7797 len. 25]: Between you and me , '' said Mrs Mallison to each visitor in turn , `` I believe we shall feel quite rich ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7798 len. 27]: Grizel Beverley delivered a spirited account of her own interview with the widow for the benefit of Cassandra on her first subsequent visit to the Court .
Parsing [sent. 7799 len. 33]: She thought it probable that rumour had already carried the announcement of the marriage , but preferred to make sure of this in indirect fashion , rather than by an open question .
Parsing [sent. 7800 len. 18]: `` Oh , she is a wonderful woman , is Mrs Mallison , '' she quoted mischievously .
Parsing [sent. 7801 len. 23]: `` The Vicar says she is bearing up wonderfully , _ I _ say she is having the time of her life .
Parsing [sent. 7802 len. 26]: Notices in the paper , references in church , flocks of callers , everyone talking about her , -- what could she wish for more ?
Parsing [sent. 7803 len. 11]: She looks so imposing , too , in her bombazines .
Parsing [sent. 7804 len. 9]: Have you the slightest idea what bombazines are ?
Parsing [sent. 7805 len. 18]: Neither have I , but you may take my word for it -- she 's got 'em !
Parsing [sent. 7806 len. 31]: Poor Papa is quite a useful stalking horse , and has a tear dropped to his memory , before she enters upon the _ real _ subject of interest . ''
Parsing [sent. 7807 len. 14]: `` I know , '' Cassandra said quietly , `` Teresa 's marriage .
Parsing [sent. 7808 len. 9]: It 's arranged for August , I hear .
Parsing [sent. 7809 len. 6]: I knew it must be .
Parsing [sent. 7810 len. 37]: Teresa 's not the sort of girl to live on her sister 's income , and Dane could n't , -- after all this time , he could n't let her turn out to work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7811 len. 17]: She sat silent for a few minutes , her eyes gazing sightlessly over the terraced gardens .
Parsing [sent. 7812 len. 14]: `` So at long last , this is the end , Grizel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7813 len. 14]: `` And at long last -- are you still sorry , Cassandra ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7814 len. 9]: `` I -- do n't -- know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7815 len. 4]: sighed Cassandra slowly .
Parsing [sent. 7816 len. 15]: `` In one way I shall be almost glad when the strain is over .
Parsing [sent. 7817 len. 17]: I 've come to see that , for him , it 's the best way out .
Parsing [sent. 7818 len. 8]: He was n't made to live alone .
Parsing [sent. 7819 len. 40]: She will make him happy -- not so happy as I could have done , but he has wasted enough time , and it 's useless waiting on ... Oh , he will patch up his life , Grizel .
Parsing [sent. 7820 len. 13]: -- It will be all new -- so many interests cropping up .
Parsing [sent. 7821 len. 9]: -- He wo n't have time to think .
Parsing [sent. 7822 len. 12]: And I shall settle down better when it 's all over .
Parsing [sent. 7823 len. 9]: Teresa 's husband wo n't be my Dane !
Parsing [sent. 7824 len. 7]: ... My poor little love story !
Parsing [sent. 7825 len. 7]: it had a very short course .
Parsing [sent. 7826 len. 17]: -- I wonder if any other married woman ever loved so wisely and so well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7827 len. 6]: Grizel made an eloquent gesture .
Parsing [sent. 7828 len. 3]: `` Hundreds !
Parsing [sent. 7829 len. 2]: Thousands !
Parsing [sent. 7830 len. 17]: Do you suppose you are the only woman who has met the right man too late ?
Parsing [sent. 7831 len. 18]: Do you suppose you are the only woman who has the decency to keep to her bond ?
Parsing [sent. 7832 len. 6]: There are thousands of them !
Parsing [sent. 7833 len. 7]: You meet them in every street .
Parsing [sent. 7834 len. 5]: But they are silent .
Parsing [sent. 7835 len. 45]: It 's the _ other _ women you hear of , -- the women who fill the divorce courts ; the women who _ do n't _ stay at home , and do their duty ... '' `` As I am doing mine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7836 len. 4]: sighed Cassandra again .
Parsing [sent. 7837 len. 9]: Then suddenly the colour flew to her face .
Parsing [sent. 7838 len. 23]: `` There 's one thing , Grizel , that I can not face , and that is being here for the marriage .
Parsing [sent. 7839 len. 39]: Think of the fuss and commotion -- all the town agog , flags out of the windows , the church bells ringing ... They 'll ring them at Beston , too , at his old church ... Grizel .
Parsing [sent. 7840 len. 9]: -- I could not endure those bells . ''
Parsing [sent. 7841 len. 7]: `` You wo n't hear them .
Parsing [sent. 7842 len. 5]: We 're going away .
Parsing [sent. 7843 len. 16]: I 've planned it all , and you 've nothing to do but to obey .
Parsing [sent. 7844 len. 17]: I 'm going to have a nervous breakdown , '' announced Grizel , with a smirk .
Parsing [sent. 7845 len. 5]: `` Poor young wife !
Parsing [sent. 7846 len. 3]: So sad .
Parsing [sent. 7847 len. 19]: Ordered abroad , and her husband absolutely _ tied _ at home : obliged to finish a book .
Parsing [sent. 7848 len. 6]: Lady Cassandra has taken her .
Parsing [sent. 7849 len. 8]: Some sort of retreat , they say .
Parsing [sent. 7850 len. 13]: Sounds very suspicious , -- but she always _ was _ excitable !
Parsing [sent. 7851 len. 7]: Pitiful for him , poor man !
Parsing [sent. 7852 len. 7]: His _ second _ wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7853 len. 3]: `` Grizel !
Parsing [sent. 7854 len. 5]: How can you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7855 len. 9]: In spite of herself Cassandra was laughing now .
Parsing [sent. 7856 len. 7]: `` But you are a darling .
Parsing [sent. 7857 len. 5]: It would be salvation .
Parsing [sent. 7858 len. 30]: If I were at home I should be obliged to go to the wedding , which would be torture for myself , and they would be happier without me !
Parsing [sent. 7859 len. 11]: Oh , let us go , do let us go !
Parsing [sent. 7860 len. 14]: I 'd be so thankful ... '' `` We _ are _ going .
Parsing [sent. 7861 len. 18]: There 's no doubt about that , but it 's as well to be prepared for emergencies .
Parsing [sent. 7862 len. 9]: Do you think the Squire will object . ''
Parsing [sent. 7863 len. 4]: `` Oh no .
Parsing [sent. 7864 len. 3]: Not now .
Parsing [sent. 7865 len. 6]: He 'll be quite pleased .
Parsing [sent. 7866 len. 20]: I have an idea , Grizel , that his mother said something to him about me before she died .
Parsing [sent. 7867 len. 29]: She knew I was unhappy , I could see it in her eyes , and ever since he has been more , -- how shall I put it ?
Parsing [sent. 7868 len. 18]: -- not affectionate , that 's over , -- more _ human _ , shall we say ?
Parsing [sent. 7869 len. 13]: He does n't take me _ quite _ so much for granted .
Parsing [sent. 7870 len. 12]: It occasionally enters his head that I 'm not very strong .
Parsing [sent. 7871 len. 20]: He would be quite willing for me to have a change , even without the excuse of your breakdown .
Parsing [sent. 7872 len. 4]: Poor young wife !
Parsing [sent. 7873 len. 8]: ... And where is the Retreat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7874 len. 4]: `` In France .
Parsing [sent. 7875 len. 3]: In Normandy .
Parsing [sent. 7876 len. 31]: It 's a convent , my dear , where they take a few _ pensionnaires _ , but I 'll arrange that there shall be no one there but ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 7877 len. 37]: I 've been before when I needed a rest , -- not the bodily _ I _ , but the other bit , whatever you choose to call it , the bit that _ feels _ !
Parsing [sent. 7878 len. 10]: Being a good Protestant I should logically hate convents .
Parsing [sent. 7879 len. 20]: As a solid fact , I get more good in this particular one than anywhere else in the world .
Parsing [sent. 7880 len. 15]: The nuns are so sweet ; they have such selfless , crystalline , child-hearts .
Parsing [sent. 7881 len. 29]: After you have been with them a few days , some of their calm begins to steal into your own heart , and the fret to die out .
Parsing [sent. 7882 len. 23]: You feel such a long , long way from the outside world , that you look at everything from a new perspective .
Parsing [sent. 7883 len. 17]: It came upon me with quite a shock that all my trouble had been about myself !
Parsing [sent. 7884 len. 9]: ... My own waiting , my own loss .
Parsing [sent. 7885 len. 44]: But these sweet things have buried self ... Oh , it does one good , Cassandra , and the regular Spartan life , the bare floors , the exquisite , exquisite , cleanliness , -- it 's all a tonic and an inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 7886 len. 14]: It 's not dull either ; do n't think that it 's dull !
Parsing [sent. 7887 len. 13]: I take my prettiest clothes , and an assortment of selected jokes .
Parsing [sent. 7888 len. 8]: They love 'em , the dear things !
Parsing [sent. 7889 len. 8]: I believe they love me too . ''
Parsing [sent. 7890 len. 9]: `` I 'm quite sure of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 7891 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7892 len. 29]: Grizel smirked complacently , `` so am I. To tell you the truth I 'm a tonic to them , so I give as much as I take .
Parsing [sent. 7893 len. 16]: They do me good , and I shock them , so we 're both happy .
Parsing [sent. 7894 len. 29]: The Reverend Mother once felt it her duty to reprove me , but her eyes danced , so I went steadfastly on , and did it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 7895 len. 5]: `` And the services ?
Parsing [sent. 7896 len. 9]: Do you go to the services too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7897 len. 19]: `` Of course , and enjoy them so much that they have fond hopes of converting me altogether .
Parsing [sent. 7898 len. 10]: They wo n't ; but that 's a detail .
Parsing [sent. 7899 len. 87]: Thank goodness , I am so constituted that it 's always the similarity between creeds that strikes me , never the difference , so I find help in them all ... We 'll allow a month for the convent , -- I ca n't decently recover from a nervous breakdown in less than a month , -- but we 'll take a few days off now and then for excursions in the neighbourhood , and _ then _ , darling , we come home by Paris !
Parsing [sent. 7900 len. 22]: Food for the spirit , and food for the flesh ... _ Nothing _ is more reviving than a becoming hat .
Parsing [sent. 7901 len. 27]: We 'll buy hats , Cassandra , and be blowed to expense ... What 's the very most you have ever spent on a hat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7902 len. 26]: `` I never have told , and I never will , '' Cassandra said firmly , `` but it had a real lace veil . ''
Parsing [sent. 7903 len. 6]: She sighed with melancholy resignation .
Parsing [sent. 7904 len. 24]: `` Somehow , Grizel , even hats lose their savour , when there 's no one to care ... '' `` Rubbish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7905 len. 10]: cried Grizel tersely , `` and you know it .
Parsing [sent. 7906 len. 8]: A woman buys hats to please herself .
Parsing [sent. 7907 len. 12]: Half the time her husband calls them ` The Limit ' !
Parsing [sent. 7908 len. 30]: and her friends wonder how she _ can _ , but so long as she and the mirror are agreed , it does n't make a rap of difference .
Parsing [sent. 7909 len. 29]: She wears it to the end ... Cassandra , darling , I feel it in my bones that I 'm going to find the hat of my life !
Parsing [sent. 7910 len. 15]: Ought n't we to be dreadfully thankful that we go in for different styles ?
Parsing [sent. 7911 len. 18]: All would be over between us , if we fell in love with the same model ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7912 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 7913 len. 8]: `` IT 'S JUST -- LIFE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7914 len. 26]: Grizel came slowly down the long , straight path leading from the convent to the orchard wall , which marked the boundary of the grounds .
Parsing [sent. 7915 len. 55]: It was a high wall rising some eight or ten feet above the path , and serving as a support for fruit trees , but at the farther end a sloping gangway of grass led to a terraced walk from which a view could be obtained over the low-lying country stretching towards the sea .
Parsing [sent. 7916 len. 18]: On the terrace stood Cassandra , her white figure strongly outlined against the blue of the skies .
Parsing [sent. 7917 len. 21]: She turned at her friend 's approach , and beheld that in Grizel 's eyes which startled her into attention .
Parsing [sent. 7918 len. 9]: `` You have something to tell me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7919 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7920 len. 8]: `` What is it , Grizel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7921 len. 6]: `` It is a confession .
Parsing [sent. 7922 len. 18]: I have told you a lie ... I told it deliberately , for your own good . ''
Parsing [sent. 7923 len. 8]: `` What did you tell me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7924 len. 14]: `` I said that the wedding day was to be on the twenty-fifth .
Parsing [sent. 7925 len. 7]: That would be next Wednesday . ''
Parsing [sent. 7926 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7927 len. 6]: `` That was the lie !
Parsing [sent. 7928 len. 7]: I told you the wrong date .
Parsing [sent. 7929 len. 12]: They were married on the tenth , -- twelve days ago .
Parsing [sent. 7930 len. 5]: It is all over .
Parsing [sent. 7931 len. 17]: The meeting is over , the ceremony is over , the honeymoon is nearly over too .
Parsing [sent. 7932 len. 10]: They will soon be thinking of going home . ''
Parsing [sent. 7933 len. 13]: Cassandra looked at her , and the blood rushed over her face .
Parsing [sent. 7934 len. 16]: A tremor passed over it , of shock , of anguish , of incredulous surprise .
Parsing [sent. 7935 len. 19]: Her lips quivered , and the fingers of her hands interlaced till the muscles showed white beneath skin .
Parsing [sent. 7936 len. 29]: She asked no more questions , and Grizel stood by her side , watching in silence for the first sight of that which was to be her reward .
Parsing [sent. 7937 len. 33]: She waited many minutes , but it came at last , shining forth more and more strongly as the shock and the pain lost their keenness , -- a look of relief !
Parsing [sent. 7938 len. 21]: Cassandra 's shoulders heaved , she drew a long , fluttering breath , and her eyes grew moist with tears .
Parsing [sent. 7939 len. 6]: `` Oh , thank God .
Parsing [sent. 7940 len. 4]: _ Over _ !
Parsing [sent. 7941 len. 28]: I have been dreading , how I have been dreading ... Grizel , Grizel , if you only knew -- '' `` I _ did _ know !
Parsing [sent. 7942 len. 31]: Every minute of the day you would have been with them , -- following them , seeing , imagining , _ hearing _ , torturing yourself , squandering your strength !
Parsing [sent. 7943 len. 9]: My dear , I am a woman too !
Parsing [sent. 7944 len. 4]: I did know .
Parsing [sent. 7945 len. 26]: So I lied , and the day passed by in peace , here with the dear nuns , and you knew nothing -- nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7946 len. 5]: `` Thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7947 len. 4]: cried Cassandra again .
Parsing [sent. 7948 len. 7]: `` It was a blessed lie .
Parsing [sent. 7949 len. 17]: I shall be thankful to you all my life for what it spared me , Grizel .
Parsing [sent. 7950 len. 8]: It 's a weight rolled off . ''
Parsing [sent. 7951 len. 15]: She stood silent , with drawn brows , nerving herself to the new facts .
Parsing [sent. 7952 len. 3]: Dane married .
Parsing [sent. 7953 len. 4]: Dane a husband .
Parsing [sent. 7954 len. 7]: Dane happy with his girl wife .
Parsing [sent. 7955 len. 8]: For he _ would _ be happy .
Parsing [sent. 7956 len. 22]: Cassandra realised that fact , and the acknowledgment brought with it , not joy , but at least a chastened relief .
Parsing [sent. 7957 len. 49]: He would never altogether forget the woman who had been his ideal mate , but as a sane , honest man he would thrust the thought of her farther and farther into the background , while the tendrils of affection would twine more closely round wife and child .
Parsing [sent. 7958 len. 14]: Teresa had been brave and patient ; now she would have her reward .
Parsing [sent. 7959 len. 16]: The husband of the future would be more her lover than the bridegroom of to-day .
Parsing [sent. 7960 len. 16]: Cassandra leant her arms on the low walls , and gazed over the country beneath .
Parsing [sent. 7961 len. 40]: All was flat , and bare , and uninteresting , one square meadow succeeding another , divided by the same dwarfed line of hedgeway ; a monotonous outlook , beautified only where the sun lent the glory of colour .
Parsing [sent. 7962 len. 14]: `` And so , '' said Cassandra slowly , `` it all ends !
Parsing [sent. 7963 len. 42]: ... I waited for a big thing to fill my heart , and it came , and was more wonderful , more beautiful , than I had ever imagined ... And it passed , and I am left to go on .
Parsing [sent. 7964 len. 14]: All my life is before me , but the big thing has passed .
Parsing [sent. 7965 len. 2]: Grizel !
Parsing [sent. 7966 len. 20]: it does n't seem possible that it should all be over ... '' `` You are thirty-two , Cassandra .
Parsing [sent. 7967 len. 13]: The big things of life are not all over at thirty-two . ''
Parsing [sent. 7968 len. 4]: Cassandra sighed sharply .
Parsing [sent. 7969 len. 45]: `` So you say -- so you say ... You are thinking of the future , of long years ahead , but I have to face life to-day ; to walk along a flat , dull road , and leave the sunshine behind . ''
Parsing [sent. 7970 len. 10]: She flung out her arms towards the country below .
Parsing [sent. 7971 len. 7]: `` Look at it , Grizel !
Parsing [sent. 7972 len. 5]: My lot lies there .
Parsing [sent. 7973 len. 9]: And I 've been on the heights ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7974 len. 11]: `` You are thirty-two , Cassandra , '' Grizel said .
Parsing [sent. 7975 len. 11]: `` The heights are not all over at thirty-two . ''
Parsing [sent. 7976 len. 7]: But again Cassandra refused the comfort .
Parsing [sent. 7977 len. 54]: `` Oh , of all the things that might have happened to me , this was the last that I expected -- to have come through so much , -- to have loved , and been loved , to have fought and won , and to be left with -- _ Nothing _ !
Parsing [sent. 7978 len. 6]: No change , no difference .
Parsing [sent. 7979 len. 9]: That seems just the hardest ending of all !
Parsing [sent. 7980 len. 72]: If there had been a big upheaval , and outside things had changed to match , even if it had been for the worse , it would be easier than to go back , -- a woman whose whole nature has been revolutionised , -- and fit oneself into the same narrow groove , knowing that the page is turned for ever , and that there is no more hope . ''
Parsing [sent. 7981 len. 14]: `` You are thirty-two , Cassandra , '' Grizel said a third time .
Parsing [sent. 7982 len. 11]: `` No pages are turned for ever at thirty-two . ''
Parsing [sent. 7983 len. 86]: `` But , oh , Grizel , Grizel , when you read of these things happening to people in books , there is always _ Something _ tangible to take hold of ... It may be tragedy , or it may be joy , but at least there is _ Something _ to mark the difference , and I have nothing , but a memory which I must try to kill ... There 's no poetry in it , Grizel , there 's no romance .
Parsing [sent. 7984 len. 8]: It is n't even -- fair ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7985 len. 8]: `` No , '' sighed Grizel softly .
Parsing [sent. 7986 len. 8]: `` It 's just -- Life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7987 len. 3]: The End .
